Goodenough of University of Texas at Austin, M. Stanley Whittingham of the State University of New York at Bingham, and Akira Yoshino of Asahi Corporation of Japan for the development of lithium (Li)-ion batteries. It is a recognition for each practitioner who has contributed to the development of Li-ion batteries: proposing the fundamental working mechanism, creating the prototype in laboratory, and achieving the successful commercialization that the Nobel chemistry prize was awarded to three scientists in the field of Li-ion batteries. Moreover, it is also an encouragement for those who are still engaged in the research and development of Li-ion or next-generation batteries and devote to promoting the processes of a clean and wireless society. There is no doubt that Li-ion batteries have gradually touched every aspect of the society and accompany with us in our daily life. 50 years has passed from the firstly proposed concept to the present commercialization, which is a journey full of twists and turns. The success of Li-ion batteries from concept to commercial products with wide application is highly depended on the cooperation from multi-disciplines, multi-fields and multi-countries. The research and development of Li-ion batteries involves physics, chemistry, materials, energy, mechanics, automation, informatics, electronics, and other fields, in which the basic principle of energy storage in Li-ion batteries relies on the internal electrochemical reactions. The popularization of Li-ion batteries in our daily life requires not only the creation of original innovations from scientists, but also scale-up manufacture from engineers to form a products, the establishment of standards in industry, the design of product according to the demand of end-users, the product marketing, and other aspects, which is a system engineering. Through the continuous communications and inspirations of the researchers in Li-ion batteries, in which Nobel Prize winner, John B. Goodenough, Stanley Whittingham, and Akira Yoshino are representative, Li-ion batteries keep on advancing in the ups and downs. Li-ion batteries have revolutionized our daily life significantly towards wireless and clean style, leading to rapidly increasing demands for batteries with higher energy density and safety. However, limited by the working principle, the energy density of Li-ion batteries is approaching to the theoretical value recently and the growth rate of energy density has decreased from 7% to 2% per year. In order to further promote the development of high-energy-density and rechargeable batteries, the new working principles, systems, and methods to achieve the new energy storage devices with higher energy density, safer and faster charge are highly required. The fundamental understanding on the evolution of battery materials at the electronic, atomic, molecular and material level while working is necessary. Moreover, the integral recycling and remanufacturing of Li-ion batteries should also be taken into consideration owing to the limited resources and environmental capacity in the earth, especially when Li-ion batteries become the mainstream of energy storage systems in the future. Under such background, many new battery systems have been proposed, such as Li-sulfur batteries, Li-air batteries, sodium-ion batteries, potassium-ion batteries, magnesium-ion batteries, aluminum-ion batteries, zinc-ion batteries, and solid-state batteries. The emerging but increasing new materials provide new opportunities for the development of battery systems. It is highly expected to propose new-type energy storage devices with unique properties to satisfy the needs of energy storage equipment in the future by introducing sodium, potassium, aluminum, zinc, and other alkaline or alkaline earth metals in battery system. The breakthroughs of next-generation batteries are on the way for a wireless and non-fossil society. Next-generation batteries are in strong pursuit around the world for the breakthrough in key technologies. The emerging battery chemistries with different features can be developed for the various scenarios in practical applications.

Although virtual laboratories have been realized as a supporting tool in learning process, their applications in vocational education have not been extensively explored yet. With the learning characteristics of the vocational which are a fairly large proportion of practical compared to theoretical activities. This paper reviews the latest developments of virtual labs to gain insight into the various virtual laboratories that may relevant to vocational education. This study used a systematic literature review of selected research papers based on relevant keywords of the virtual lab in vocational education. Insights from the papers reviewed subsequently were developed to elaborate on the use of a virtual lab to be applied in vocational education. Practical learning in vocational education with a virtual lab becomes more flexible without limited space and time. In terms of financing, the development of a virtual lab doesn't require a large amount of investment if compared with actual laboratory development. For a long period of implementation, there must be added a basic learning process before used, the user has to get experience-based learning first that emphasizes the role of active experience and student involvement. The virtual lab can be applied to practical learning in vocational education, for example in the field of mechanical engineering it can be applied in learning to maintain fuel systems on the engine, with characteristics in the form of procedural steps. The virtual lab can be applied to facilitate students in the learning process so the learning efficiency can increase significantly.\", authkeywords=None, citedby_count=12, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfree2read', freetoreadLabel='Bronze', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85076860913', doi='10.1098/rspb.2019.1484', pii=None, pubmed_id='31847781', title=\"Articulating 'free, prior and informed consent' (FPIC) for engineered gene drives\", subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='George D.R.', afid='60004923', affilname='NC State University', affiliation_city='Raleigh', affiliation_country='United States', author_count='3', author_names='George, Dalton R.;Kuiken, Todd;Delborne, Jason A.', author_ids='57212495234;35337324800;24536764200', author_afids='60004923;60004923;60004923', coverDate='2019-12-18', coverDisplayDate='18 December 2019', publicationName='Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences', issn='09628452', source_id='130030', eIssn='14712954', aggregationType='Journal', volume='286', issueIdentifier='1917', article_number='20191484', pageRange=None, description='Recent statements by United Nations bodies point to free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) as a potential requirement in the development of engineered gene drive applications.

Without an explicit framework of application, FPIC could be interpreted as a narrowly framed process of community consultation focused on the social implications of technology, and award little formal or advisory power in decision-making to Indigenous peoples and local communities. In this paper, we argue for an articulation of FPIC that attends to issues of transparency, iterative community-scale consent, and shared power through co-development among Indigenous peoples, local communities, researchers and technology developers.

This study proposes a driver assistive tool for elder drivers which respond immediately in case of potential accidents by giving appropriate warning or arrestments. This tool monitors the movement of the vehicle dynamically with the behavior of the driver, detects the irregularity between the driver and the vehicle. Sensory devices which have been installed in the vehicle include the imaging camera, inertial measurement unit, Lidar scanner, steering wheel angle sensor, depression sensors on accelerator pedal and brake pedal to form a sensory network for the purpose of collecting signals for irregularity identification. In order to detect the surrounding suspicious objects, an array of ultrasonic sensors was installed on the vehicle and to evaluate the irregularity level of the danger, a sensor harness was integrated. When the risk level reaches a significant level, a danger classification information will be delivered to the processing center and a corresponding ensemble of sensory feedback will be activated to remind to the driver.

In this metaphor, the insights gleaned from biological evolution were applied to engineering innovation. Biological evolution and engineering innovation are similar in that both exhibit creative destruction as evidenced by Darwin and Schumpeter. In the research analyses, special attention is given to the current multipolar world, with the poles consisting of societies based on different cultural traditions and to the emerging renaissance of decentralized production and its current iteration, Co-Engaging Production. The metaphor used in this paper challenges and even contradicts conventionally explicit and embedded beliefs in six ways. First, the dominance of Occidental science and engineering cannot be expected to last indefinitely. Second, the current dominance of Occidental science and engineering can have detrimental effects on engineering innovation. Third, free trade leads to inefficiency. Fourth, successful engineering innovation requires societal legitimacy and environmental conformity. Fifth, human cognition forms the basis of multipolar types of science and engineering.

From the design of the STEAM class, teachers can know how to stimulate students’ interest in programming and cultivating their ability to innovate and solve practical problems more clearly with KidsProgram. Design/methodology/approach: This paper will explain the teaching design from ten aspects and implement it in real class to see the result. The ten aspects are situations creation, knowledge popularization, raising problems, analyzing problems, concepts introduction, interface design, logic design, self-evaluation and mutual evaluation, teacher comments and extension and innovation. With the KidsProgram platform, this paper takes “The Missile Convey,” a sub-course of “Discovery Universe” as an example. Through the situation created by the teacher, students brainstorm the dangers that the earth may encounter in the universe and then learn relevant scientific knowledge. Next, students raise and analyze problems according to the situation under the guidance of the teacher. Through the interaction with teachers, students review the programming concepts and the usage of corresponding coding blocks needed for the project, like “random number.” They need to carry out interface design and logic design for the project, and complete the project. After that, the students use the self-evaluation form and the mutual evaluation form to modify and then show and share the projects to the in front of the class. After self-evaluation and peer evaluation, the teacher will make a final summary evaluation and make some suggestions for improvement. From the students’ programming productions and the interviews with them, the teaching result can be known. Findings: With elaborate teaching design and appropriate teaching strategies, students can flexibly use multi-disciplinary knowledge of science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics to solve problems in the process of creation, which is conducive to the cultivation and improvement of students’ comprehensive quality on KidsProgram classroom, under the guidance of STEAM education. In other words, in this class, students need to use engineering thinking to plan the whole project based on the understanding of scientific principles, design interfaces with artistic ideas, use mathematical knowledge for logical operations, and gradually solve technical problems with the above knowledge or methods in a comprehensive way. Originality/value: The KidsProgram is a leading graphical programming tool platform in China in recent years. It deeply reconstructs the concept of Scratch designed by MIT. Graphic programming, a method of programming by dragging and dropping blocks containing natural languages, is different from traditional code programming. In this paper, the visualized cases in the class will be demonstrated in the “interface design” and “logic design.” This paper designs a course in STEAM education at distance via KidsProgram, hoping to provide some reference for other research on teaching of graphical programming tools.', authkeywords='Distance education | Graphical programming | KidsProgram | STEAM education | Teaching practice', citedby_count=5, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85078233458', doi='10.1088/1757-899X/703/1/012026', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Perceived kansei and performance-based usability impact on satisfaction for web-based applications', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Hartono M.', afid='60104303', affilname='Universitas Surabaya', affiliation_city='Surabaya', affiliation_country='Indonesia', author_count='1', author_names='Hartono, M.', author_ids='36055120100', author_afids='60104303', coverDate='2019-12-05', coverDisplayDate='5 December 2019', publicationName='IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering', issn='17578981', source_id='19700200831', eIssn='1757899X', aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume='703', issueIdentifier='1', article_number='012026', pageRange=None, description=\"Kansei Engineering has been applied intensively for product design and development considering the deepest layer of customer needs, known as Kansei, which is related to emotional need or affect.

Therefore, this paper proposes a framework for business ecosystem modeling with the discussion of system engineering and ecological modeling. The domain of smart grid is selected to demonstrate how system engineering, especially standards and ontologies contribute to the business ecosystem modeling. The proposed framework of the business ecosystem modeling includes three parts and nine stages that combines theories from system engineering, ecology, and business ecosystem. Part I-Business ecosystem architecture development includes four stages which aims to identify a target business ecosystem and its elements (actors, roles, and interactions). Part II-Factor analysis includes two stages to identify potential changes (and the dimensions of the changes) in the ecosystem. Part III- Ecosystem simulation and reconfiguration aims to use simulations to investigate the transition of an ecosystem and the re-configurated ecosystem.

The SCS has experienced complex geological processes including continental lithospheric breakup, seafloor spreading and oceanic crust subduction, which leads debates for decades. However, there are still no clear answers regarding to the following aspects: the crustal and Moho structure, the structure of the continent-ocean transition zone, the formation and evolution process and geodynamic mechanism, and deep processes and their coupling relationships with the petroliferous basins in the SCS. Under the guidance of the “Deep-Earth” science and technology innovation strategy of the Ministry of Natural Resources, deep structural and comprehensive geological research are carried out in the SCS. Geophysical investigations such as long array-large volume deep reflection seismic, gravity, magnetism and ocean bottom seismometer are carried out. The authors proposed that joint gravity-magnetic-seismic inversion should be used to obtain deep crustal information in the SCS and construct high resolution deep structural sections in different regions of the SCS.

STEM workers are critical thinkers as they contribute immensely by driving innovations. There is a high demand for professionals in the STEM fields but there is also a shortage of human resource in these areas. One way to reduce this problem is by identifying students who are at-risk of dropping out and then intervening with focused strategies that will ensure that these students remain in same the programme till graduation. Therefore, this research aims to use a data mining classification technique to identify students who are at-risk of dropping out from their Computing Science (CS) degree programmes. The Random Forest (RF) decision tree algorithm is used to learn patterns from historical data about first-year undergraduate CS students who are enrolled in a tertiary institute in the South Pacific. A number of factors are used which comprise of students demographic information, previous education background, financial information as well as data about students' academic interaction. Feature selection is performed to determine which factors have greater influence in students' decision in dropping out.

Multifunctionality can be achieved by exploiting these properties for practical applications. Next-generation fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites will have significant secondary functions besides their conventional primary feature-high strength-to-weight ratio. A key concept that would enable the large-scale manufacturing and application of multifunctional FRPs is 'design for multifunctionality', which uses material design tools, such as integrated computational materials engineering (ICME), to facilitate innovations in materials. In this review, we examined recent research and studies on novel functions of FRPs and the matrices, reinforcements, and fillers that enable these functions. The functions included in the scope of this study include sensing, actuation, self-healing, heat resistance, thermal insulation/dissipation, electrical isolation/conduction, energy harvesting, electromagnetic shielding, etc. In addition, the design, modeling, and manufacturing processes of these functional FRPs were discussed. This review aims to serve as a collection of knowledge that supports the ICME of next-generation FRPs and a catalog of function enablers from the novel material developers' perspective.\", authkeywords='Design for multifunctionality | Electrical functions | Fiber-reinforced polymer composites | Functional composite | Integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) | Mechanical functions | Thermal functions', citedby_count=34, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85091123869', doi='10.17159/2309-8775/2019/v61n4a4', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='small-scale dispersed green infrastructure - A fitting civil engineering solution to stormwater quality improvement?', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Brink I.C.', afid='60001565', affilname='Stellenbosch University', affiliation_city='Stellenbosch', affiliation_country='South Africa', author_count='1', author_names='Brink, I.

In this article, based on the principle/agent problem and Holmström and Milgrom’s work on optimal contracts it is argued that the current general conditions of architectural and engineering consulting agreements in Sweden (ABK 09)—a standard type of contract often used in developer/consultant relations—may not incentivize choices that support the long-term goals of society. Furthermore, although this exploratory study specifically analyses a Swedish standard contract, the question of how contractual incentive structures can optimize real-world performance is a general one, and thus the article’s findings have general applicability. This exploratory study also points to further research into how contractual structures impact climate-neutral buildings. In this way, Swedish consultants who use ABK 09 are incentivized to include low-risk, well-proven, and widely used technologies in order to minimize risks for themselves. This study contributes to resolving this dilemma by suggesting how ABK 09 could be restructured to change the balance between incentives and risk and incentivize innovation and sustainability. As mentioned above, the current study operates at a theoretical level. It discusses six possible changes that would better align the contract with the societal goals of innovation and sustainability.', authkeywords='Buildings | Construction sector | Contracts | Incentives for innovation | Institutional economics | Sweden', citedby_count=6, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85076693356', doi='10.3390/w11122543', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Co-design of engineered hyporheic zones to improve in-stream stormwater treatment and facilitate regulatory approval', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Herzog S.P.', afid='60025038;60021121;60014965;116055441', affilname=\"University of California, Berkeley;Indiana University Bloomington;Colorado School of Mines;Engineering Research Center for Re-inventing the Nation's Urban Water Infrastructure (ReNUWIt)\", affiliation_city='Berkeley;Bloomington;Golden;Stanford', affiliation_country='United States;United States;United States;United States', author_count='8', author_names='Herzog, Skuyler P.;Eisenstein, William A.;Halpin, Brittnee N.;Portmann, Andrea C.;Fitzgerald, Nicole J.M.;Ward, Adam S.;Higgins, Christopher P.;McCray, John E.', author_ids='56465540500;55651362900;57212459489;57212299933;57200436978;35995977100;8629429300;7006222187', author_afids='60021121-60014965-116055441;116055441-60025038;60014965-116055441;60014965-116055441;60014965-116055441;60021121;60014965-116055441;60014965-116055441', coverDate='2019-12-01', coverDisplayDate='1 December 2019', publicationName='Water (Switzerland)', issn=None, source_id='21100255400', eIssn='20734441', aggregationType='Journal', volume='11', issueIdentifier='12', article_number='2543', pageRange=None, description='Green infrastructure is an increasingly popular approach to mitigate widespread degradation of urban waters from stormwater pollution. However, many stormwater best management practices (BMPs) have inconsistent water quality performance and are limited to on-site, land-based deployments. To address basin-wide pollutant loads still reaching urban streams, hyporheic zone engineering has been proposed as an in-stream treatment strategy. Recognizing that regulator and practitioner perspectives are essential for innovation in the water sector, we interviewed U.S. water management professionals about the perceived risks, opportunities, and knowledge gaps related to in-stream stormwater treatment. We used engineered hyporheic zones as a case study to understand interviewee perspectives on an emerging class of in-stream treatment technologies. Interviews revealed that many considerations for in-stream stormwater treatment are common to land-based BMPs, but in-stream BMPs have additional unique design and siting requirements. Here, we synthesize practitioner goals, their recommendations on in-stream BMP design, and open research questions related to in-stream BMPs. Many interviewees suggested pairing engineered hyporheic zones with other BMPs in a treatment train to improve in-stream treatment, while simultaneously reducing risk and cost.

In nearly a decade, relying on the exploration and development practice, science and technology research and management innovation, huge breakthroughs have been made. The laws of formation, distribution and accumulation of tight oil and gas have been researched, the development theories such as “multi-stage pressure drop” and “man-made reservoirs” have been established, and several technology series have been innovated and integrated. These technology series include enrichment regions selection, well pattern deployment, single well production and recovery factor enhancement, and low cost development. As a result, both of reserves and production of tight oil and gas increase rapidly. However, limited by the sedimentary environment and tectonic background, compared with North America, China's tight oil and gas reservoirs are worse in continuity, more difficult to develop and poorer in economic efficiency. Moreover, there are still some gaps in reservoir identification accuracy and stimulating technology between China and North America. In the future, Chinese oil and gas companies should further improve the resource evaluation method, tackle key technologies such as high-precision 3D seismic interpretation, man-made reservoir, and intelligent engineering, innovate theories and technologies to enhance single well production and recovery rate, and actively endeavor to get the finance and tax subsidy on tight oil and gas.\", authkeywords='development history | development orientation | enhancing recovery factor | man-made oil and gas reservoir | theoretical and technological advancement | tight oil and gas', citedby_count=189, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='2016ZX05015', fund_sponsor='National Major Science and Technology Projects of China'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85076568557', doi='10.1007/s11948-019-00159-3', pii=None, pubmed_id='31832866', title='The Survival Imperative: Commentary on “Whither the University?

However, this amassing productivity in the field has not been mapped and profiled thoroughly, yet. Therefore, the aim of the paper is to map the research output related to the concepts of responsible and sustainable innovations with the method of research profiling. The analysis consists of three components: general research profiling, subject area profiling and topic profiling conducted with the use of Scopus database. The research process is directed at answering three research questions: (1) who are the main contributors within the scholarly community? why? so what? (2) how is the research output distributed among subject areas? why? so what? (3) what are the central topics and issues discussed within the research field? why? so what? First of all, key contributing countries, research institutions, journals, and authors are identified in order to characterize the scholarly community working in the field. Secondly, research output is profiled through the prism of respective subject areas. This type of profiling aims at discovering varieties among key journals, authors and core references distributed across various subject areas. Thirdly, topic analysis is conducted in order to point out most crucial aspects studied in the body of literature in the field. The research sample consists of 1083 publications indexed in Scopus database, including the phrases 'responsible innovation' or 'sustainable innovation' within their titles, keywords, and abstracts (topic search). The findings from the general research profiling confirm the growing interest of academia in exploring and investigating the issues of responsible and sustainable innovations. The leading contributors in the field are scholars and research institutions from the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Dutch universities and research centers occupy three top three positions in regard to the number of publications. Among them, Delft University of Technology is the unquestionable leader. Journal of Cleaner Production and Journal of Responsible Innovation are found to be the most prolific and highly recognized source titles in the field. Subject area profiling shows a relatively high level of interrelatedness among the four leading subject areas i.e., Business, Management and Accounting, Engineering, Social Sciences, and Environmental Science in regard to authors, source titles and core references. Topic profiling indicates two leading thematic streams in the research field focused on the features and core aspects of responsible and sustainable innovations, and the relationships of the concept with people (human, humans), research, ethics, and technology. Discussion of research findings is focused around comparing and contrasting three overlapping concepts (i.e., responsible research and innovation, responsible innovation, and sustainable innovation), providing the critical assessment of the reasons for the scholarly research to have developed along with certain patterns and identifying unexplored aspects or possible future avenues of research.\", authkeywords='Bibliometrics | Research profiling | Responsible innovation | Sustainable innovation', citedby_count=10, openaccess=1, freetoread='repositoryam', freetoreadLabel='Green', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85076330786', doi='10.1016/j.hbpd.2019.07.012', pii='S1499387219301705', pubmed_id='31378474', title='International Organ Protection Symposium: The fusion of engineering and medicine', subtype='le', subtypeDescription='Letter', creator='Jia J.J.', afid='60029310;60021600;60016849;60014468', affilname='Zhejiang University School of Medicine;University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine;University of Toronto;University Health Network', affiliation_city='Hangzhou;Toronto;Toronto;Toronto', affiliation_country='China;Canada;Canada;Canada', author_count='8', author_names='Jia, Jun Jun;Li, Jian Hui;Xin, Liming;Li, Hao Yu;Badiwala, Mitesh;Sun, Yu;Xu, Xiao;Zheng, Shu Sen', author_ids='56410297500;56567233100;23062590600;57202788334;6508102103;55539109700;7405294857;35319469200', author_afids='60029310;60029310;60016849-60014468;60029310;60014468-60021600;60016849;60029310;60029310', coverDate='2019-12-01', coverDisplayDate='December 2019', publicationName='Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Diseases International', issn='14993872', source_id='31436', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='18', issueIdentifier='6', article_number=None, pageRange='601-602', description=None, authkeywords=None, citedby_count=5, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='2019T120525', fund_sponsor='China Postdoctoral Science Foundation'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85076301724', doi='10.1038/s41598-019-55306-4', pii=None, pubmed_id='31813931', title='Author Correction: Bases of Bacterial Sodium Channel Selectivity Among Organic Cations (Scientific Reports, (2019), 9, 1, (15260), 10.1038/s41598-019-51605-y)', subtype='er', subtypeDescription='Erratum', creator='Wang Y.', afid='60192954;60020912;60011664;60002306;60001255', affilname='Hotchkiss Brain Institute;Center for Nonlinear Studies;University of Wollongong;University of Calgary;Changchun Institute Of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy Of Sciences', affiliation_city='Calgary;Los Alamos;Wollongong;Calgary;Changchun', affiliation_country='Canada;United States;Australia;Canada;China', author_count='5', author_names='Wang, Yibo;Finol-Urdaneta, Rocio K.;Ngo, Van Anh;French, Robert J.;Noskov, Sergei Yu', author_ids='56006740600;14029690400;55145283800;7202789440;7004042121', author_afids='60001255-60002306;60192954-60011664;60002306-60020912;60192954;60002306', coverDate='2019-12-01', coverDisplayDate='1 December 2019', publicationName='Scientific Reports', issn=None, source_id='21100200805', eIssn='20452322', aggregationType='Journal', volume='9', issueIdentifier='1', article_number='18992', pageRange=None, description='In the original version of this Article, Yibo Wang and Rocio K.

Most strategies still rely on blotting microscope grids with paper to produce a thin film of solution suitable for vitrification. This approach loses more than 99.9% of the applied sample and requires several seconds, leading to problematic air-water interface interactions for macromolecules in the resulting thin film of solution and complicating time-resolved studies. Recently developed self-wicking EM grids allow the use of small volumes of sample, with nanowires on the grid bars removing excess solution to produce a thin film within tens of milliseconds from sample application to freezing. Here, a simple cryo-EM specimen-preparation device that uses components from an ultrasonic humidifier to transfer protein solution onto a self-wicking EM grid is presented. The device is controlled by a Raspberry Pi single-board computer and all components are either widely available or can be manufactured by online services, allowing the device to be constructed in laboratories that specialize in cryo-EM rather than instrument design.

These challenges motivate the emerging fit-for-purpose paradigm, wherein water is provided at the precise quality level of the intended application. Unfortunately, to date, fundamental advances in materials and nanotechnology have been slow to advance this paradigm. Using examples from membrane science and engineering, we highlight the critical need to bridge research at the molecular and nano-scales with development at the device and systems-scales to fully realize sustainable fit-for-purpose water technology. Specifically, we present four opportunities for computing and data science to accelerate convergence of sustainable water research: materials informatics and inverse design, model-based design of experiments, superstructure optimization, and uncertainty quantification. As such, we highlight opportunities to collaboratively revolutionize molecular-to-systems engineering of sustainable water technologies, but emphasize open communication between data scientists and water-focused researchers using a common vocabulary as a significant hurdle.', authkeywords=None, citedby_count=26, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherhybridgold', freetoreadLabel='Hybrid Gold', fund_acr='NSF', fund_no='1512089', fund_sponsor='National Science Foundation'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85074261384', doi='10.1186/s40594-019-0190-3', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Vigilante Innovation (VIX): case study on the development of student skills through a team-based design process and environment', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Oliver K.H.', afid='60010060;60006475;60003915', affilname='Vanderbilt University School of Engineering;Vanderbilt University School of Medicine;Vanderbilt University', affiliation_city='Nashville;Nashville;Nashville', affiliation_country='United States;United States;United States', author_count='3', author_names='Oliver, Kendra H.;Ehrman, Jonathan D.;Marasco, Christina C.', author_ids='56223871400;57211514579;37034568100', author_afids='60006475-60003915;60003915;60003915-60010060', coverDate='2019-12-01', coverDisplayDate='1 December 2019', publicationName='International Journal of STEM Education', issn=None, source_id='21100873488', eIssn='21967822', aggregationType='Journal', volume='6', issueIdentifier='1', article_number='36', pageRange=None, description='Background: Many undergraduate students majoring in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields lack experience in collaborative thinking, limiting their effectiveness as they enter careers in academic and industrial environments. The SyBBURE Searle Undergraduate Research Program has incorporated a team-based design component into its curriculum to fill this gap in training. This design framework, called Vigilante Innovation (VIX) to highlight its emphasis on self-initiation and action, has evolved into a multi-semester-long group undertaking that combines just-in-time training in entrepreneurship and project design with student-driven collaborations aimed at solving a real-world problem. We hypothesize that this framework provides a hands-on, realistic workplace simulation task through which students can develop an understanding of teamwork. Results: Using a case-study approach, we discuss the development of the VIX design framework since its inception in 2014 and assess the impact of the VIX framework on student learning and growth using a student survey from 2016 to 2017 and student interviews from 2018. Conclusions: A flexible approach, an annualized project timeline, a student-driven prototyping space, and self-selecting project areas emerged as key contributors to the successful implementation of the VIX design and to deepened student learning. The diversity of VIX teams, the self-reported success of student projects, and student interviews indicate that students who participate in VIX possess an in-depth understanding of team-based strategies. These findings support the VIX framework as an effective method of providing undergraduates in STEM fields with efficient and meaningful exposure to the team-based entrepreneurial skills that are vital in their future careers. Additional work is needed to determine if this approach has a long-term impact on student success in team-based environments.

A high quality of life and livability are demanded in cities; however, rapid and unplanned urbanization creates a lot of challenges such as poverty, slums, social instability, insecurity, diseases, environmental challenges and climate change, unemployment, economic problems, etc., which threaten the livability of the world. Therefore, it is vital to tackle urbanization challenges and create a sustainable urban setting with a high quality of life in order to make the world a better place to live. In particular, literature reviews, surveys, exploratory case studies, and the Kiwi and Kampenhood methodology based on Persian Zarathustra that is utilized in social science, engineering and management are the main method tools in this study.

However, microbial contamination continues to be one of the major barriers in ethanologenic processes, resulting in low ethanol yields and thereby translating into economic losses. To this end, technological innovations geared towards effective elimination of microbial contamination are constantly being developed. This review explores and discusses the fermentation conditions that facilitate the growth of undesired microorganisms during ethanol fermentation processes.

Although each one has evolved through separate trajectories in professional practice and in research; however, in this work, their paths meet under the framework of the Learning Oriented Assessment. The convergence of these interactive techniques came to reality as an instructional design with the main objective being to enhance the students’ performance in applying concepts to solve Physics problems. To evaluate the impact of combining these techniques versus applying them separately, a research-action project was executed. A total of 157 students from Physics II courses at the Puebla campus of Tecnologico de Monterrey participated in this project. The empirical investigation showed that the group undergoing the combined techniques experienced a superior development of disciplinary competencies compared to the group where the techniques were applied individually. It was possible to verify that the best students (those with better academic performance) were better adapted to the method of Learning Oriented Assessment. The results did not show that the lower level academic students had differences in performance or level of achievement.

The opportunities for development lie on a new forefront of innovation where medical physics integrates with engineering, data science, and modern computing capacities.

While this is consistent with typical standards for both academic scholars and practitioners, less is known about the structure of these preferences, how different they are, especially with regard to innovations in Public Transport. Previous research works have been successful in bringing together and developing a comprehensive set of state-of-the-art innovations that could be potentially valuable for Public Transport Authorities and Operators in covering mobility needs. Purpose: Going a step further, this study collected empirical evidence on the preferences’ pattern of European citizens when considering these innovations. The present study’s objectives were (a) to measure European citizens’ preferences regarding Public Transport innovations, (b) to examine potential differences at individual level between innovations and demographic and behavioral measures, and (c) to profile respondents based on a multidimensional set of parameters including individual preference scores. Methods: Correspondingly, the study employed complementary methodological designs like the Maximum Difference Scaling method, which is an effective tool for encompassing large numbers of attributes, Analysis of Variance, and Latent Class Analysis. Results: Findings prioritized significant differences in user preferences along the tested innovations and innovations were linked to specific motivational schemes (viz. “information provision”, “efficient design concerns”, “provision of effectiveness”, “pricing concerns”, and “assistance provision”). Motivational schemes and their properties encompassing users’ diverse patterns of ranked preferences regarding Public Transport innovations were then employed as the basis for profiling.

Flat slab system is a slab that is only supported by columns without any supporting beam. By the abstain of beams, designers are able to reduce the storey height and to reduce the structural weight. Other than that, flat slabs offer a more flexible installation of building utilities, simpler reinforcement, and simpler installation of scaffolding and formwork. This study was conducted to analyse the performance of flat slabs when applied to buildings compared with the conventional slabs. The flat slab system is expected to be able to withstand gravity and earthquake loads. The Building of the Faculty of Sport Science, Universitas Negeri Malang, with a total of 7 floors and 1 semi-basement was used as research object. This research was conducted using programme simulation, ETABS and SAP2000. The research was intended to analyse the resulting seismic base shear, the fundamental period, the structural stiffness, the ultimate performance evaluation, and the storey drift if the building designed using flat slab system. Results showed that (1) Building with flat slab system has a lighter weight than the one with conventional slab system. Building weight affects the seismic base shear value of the building. The heavier a building is, the greater the seismic base shear value of a building; (2) The fundamental period analysis resulted the structural vibration time (Tc) in flat slab structure is greater than in the conventional slabs. The heavier the building weight, the structural vibration time (Tc) that occurs will be smaller; (3) The structural stiffness of building using flat slab system is less than in the conventional slabs system; (4) Both of building using flat slab system and conventional slabs meet the requirement of service performance and ultimate performance; and (5) The storey drift in building using flat slab system is larger than in the conventional slabs.

However, the social impact that infrastructures have is huge and its analysis and understanding are fundamental. At the same time, social aspects such as culture or human behaviour can have significant effects during the different stages of the lifecycle of infrastructures. Therefore, a better understanding of the connections between civil engineering and society can help to better adapt infrastructures to their contexts, as well as minimise their negative impacts; as a result, this understanding can bring about infrastructures that are more socially sustainable. The scarce studies that have assessed the connection between society and civil engineering have considered this relationship as unidirectional. The real scenario is not so simple. The analysis of this relationship needs to be interdisciplinary, and it is in this context that this paper addresses the analysis of infrastructures and of social sciences from a sociotechnical point of view. We draw on the interrelationships found to propose a conceptual framework with the main objective of providing both practitioners and academics with tools to carry out more sustainable and context-adapted decisions. We classify the fields of civil engineering and social sciences into several different subfields, namely six for infrastructures (transport, water, energy, environment, urban planning and buildings) and twelve for social sciences (culture and history, behaviour and mind, communication and interaction, socioeconomics, juridical sciences, life and health, politics, social problems, social groups, ethics and philosophy, arts and education and innovation). Afterwards, we review the existing literature at the intersection between the various categories. We conclude proposing a framework that can support decisions and actions made at different levels and working areas. The framework includes guidelines for a more holistic consideration of the interaction between infrastructures and society in key activities whereby an improved understanding of the effect of this relationship is often required. The guidelines provide a description of different key areas and can be applied to a wide variety of actions ranging from the development of university curricula to the social impact assessment of projects.', authkeywords='Civil engineering | Humanities | Interdisciplinarity | Social sciences | Social sustainability', citedby_count=20, openaccess=0, freetoread='repositoryvor', freetoreadLabel='Green', fund_acr='AGAUR', fund_no='2018 FI_B 00655', fund_sponsor='Generalitat de Catalunya'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85070219994', doi='10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.117782', pii='S0959652619326423', pubmed_id=None, title=\"Efficiency evaluation of green technology innovation of China's strategic emerging industries: An empirical analysis based on Malmquist-data envelopment analysis index\", subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Luo Q.', afid='60029306;60013008', affilname='Wuhan University;Anhui University of Science and Technology', affiliation_city='Wuhan;Huainan', affiliation_country='China;China', author_count='5', author_names='Luo, Qiaoling;Miao, Chenglin;Sun, L.;Meng, Xiaona;Duan, Mengmeng', author_ids='54976915900;55516320000;55515971900;57213100675;57210290752', author_afids='60029306;60013008;60013008;60013008;60013008', coverDate='2019-11-20', coverDisplayDate='20 November 2019', publicationName='Journal of Cleaner Production', issn='09596526', source_id='19167', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='238', issueIdentifier=None, article_number='117782', pageRange=None, description=\"Green technology innovation is the main driving force for sustainable development of China's strategic emerging industries.

The empirical results show that changes in trends of technology innovation efficiency of strategic emerging industries are increasing, due mainly to technological progress and promotion of technology efficiency. Promotion of technology efficiency results from the joint action of pure technology efficiency increasing (0.1%) and scale efficiency increasing (0.2%). The change index of green technology innovation efficiency varies greatly in different industries, being highest (1.379) in communications switching equipment manufacturers and lowest (0.775) among office equipment manufacturers.

The purpose of this paper is to discuss how innovation can develop these mission-based service industries to value-added manufacturing enterprises. Here, innovation is embedded in altering the understanding of stakeholders toward the objectives and managerial systems of these infrastructures. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses multidisciplinary principles in management, economics and engineering to assess the integration of innovation and quality management with different perspectives. It initially compares the conventional and innovative approach for operating WWTPs. Subsequently, it emphasizes the contribution of the tailor-made managerial system of wastewater treatment enterprises through prospective markets, customers’ preferences, probable competitions and shared values. Findings: The tailor-made managerial system for wastewater treatment can add economic values by manufacturing multiple demand products for local markets. Water, green energy, organic fertilizers and raw materials are the main products that can be simultaneously recovered according to the customers’ demand. The Kano model also verifies that the new managerial system has this potential to turn the conventional must-be treatment systems into delightful enterprises. It can provide different stakeholders with shared social and environmental values. Accordingly, locals and customers can be engaged in monitoring the quality of products to consider their feedback for decision making and upgrading. This indirectly defines shared values among operators and society to reinforce localization and ecosystem protection. Additionally, this research reveals that the market of the aforementioned strategic products is promising as a blue ocean for set sail due to the lack of competitors.

We identify the inhibiting factors that influence the management innovation implementation phase over time and address ways in which they evolve.We conduct a comparative longitudinal and dynamic analysis based on two intermediate-sized enterprises and address the obstacles that emerge during the implementation phase of a specific management innovation: lean manufacturing. Our results highlight different categories of inhibiting factors: some inhibiting factors appear at the beginning of the implementation phase with high intensity and then fade over time; conversely, other inhibiting factors appear later and then increase in intensity.', authkeywords='dynamic analysis | implementation phase | inhibiting factors | Management innovation', citedby_count=17, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfree2read', freetoreadLabel='Bronze', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85077367050', doi='10.1360/TB-2019-0456', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Research progress and perspective of machine learning in material design', subtype='re', subtypeDescription='Review', creator='Sun Z.', afid='60073523;60010432', affilname='State Key Laboratory of Structural Chemistry, Fuzhou;Soochow University', affiliation_city='Fuzhou;Suzhou', affiliation_country='China;China', author_count='6', author_names='Sun, Zhongti;Li, Zhenzhu;Cheng, Guanjian;Xu, Qichen;Hou, Zhufeng;Yin, Wanjian', author_ids='57208193386;56384544400;57201252255;57205170079;57194337571;12789803400', author_afids='60010432;60010432;60010432;60010432;60073523;60010432', coverDate='2019-11-15', coverDisplayDate='15 November 2019', publicationName='Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin', issn='0023074X', source_id='84932', eIssn='20959419', aggregationType='Journal', volume='64', issueIdentifier='32', article_number=None, pageRange='3270-3275', description='With rapid development of economy and society, the excessive demand for resources has caused the imbalance of ecological environment. It is therefore urgent to develop new functional materials, especially energy conversion materials, to solve the scientific and engineering problems in the field of resources and environment. However, the research and development of materials was traditionally based on inefficient trial-and-error experiments. Although state-of-the-art approach such as density functional theory (DFT) is able to simulate materials properties, the calculations of high temperature, high pressure and strong magnetic field environment, as well as the selection of strong and weak correlation system between electrons and interaction potential between atoms are still unsatisfactory. Huge amount of data produced by experiments and simulations provides databases for machine learning. Combining the theory of probability and statistics algorithm, machine learning has recently made much progress in the new material discovery and design, the prediction of material performance and application and other purposes ranged from the macroscopic to the microscopic scale, such as the statistics classification of perovskite materials, the stability prediction of perovskite materials based on high-throughput computing and intermetallic compound electrocatalysts design and selection, etc. Meanwhile, developing a physically interpretable descriptor that captures the trend of materials properties is a critical goal of data-driven science. Machine learning has been applied in the field of materials science and engineering, exhibiting a different perspective from traditional approaches. In this paper, recent progress of materials design in photovoltaics, electrocatalytic and performance evaluation of energy storage batteries are reviewed. In those efforts, machine learning aims to discover the relationships among compositional and structural features and functionality in complex systems of materials. Machine learning is a data-driven approach that relies heavily on data. Compared with image recognition and other fields that usually have millions of data, material science research often leads to over-fitting of machine learning models when the amount of training data is limited, which greatly reduces the generalization ability of machine learning methods. In order to increase the amount of material data, researchers can obtain theoretical data through high-throughput computing on the one hand, and develop methods for intelligent reading of literatures to access and obtain a large number of relevant experimental and theoretical data from publications on the other hand. Another promising method to solve the problem of finite data sets is meta-learning, that is, learning knowledge within or across problems. The development of new technologies such as neural Turing machine and imitation learning makes this process possible. Recently, it has been reported that Bayesian optimization can reach the experience level of human judgment on things through one-shot learning under the condition of limited data, which may have a huge promotion effect on materials science with scarce data with slow and expensive acquisition speed. Although machine learning methods have greatly improved their predictive accuracy in material discovery, design, performance and application, they have not expanded well in terms of transferability. Active learning methods also provide consistent and automated improvements in accuracy and transferability, making a significant contribution to the success of the universal model. In addition, one of the promising point of material science using machine learning method is to develop new descriptor owning physical interpretability, makes the black box model of statistical machine learning be explainable. In a word, the development of computer intelligence algorithms would promote the innovation of new materials discovery.', authkeywords='Descriptor | Energy conversion | Machine learning | Material design', citedby_count=8, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85075381918', doi='10.1088/1742-6596/1321/3/032011', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge math teachers: To develop 21<sup>st</sup> century skills students', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Harits M.', afid='60069439', affilname='Universitas Sebelas Maret', affiliation_city='Surakarta', affiliation_country='Indonesia', author_count='3', author_names='Harits, M.;Sujadi, I.;Slamet, I.', author_ids='58767195500;57189004992;57016838100', author_afids='60069439;60069439;60069439', coverDate='2019-11-15', coverDisplayDate='15 November 2019', publicationName='Journal of Physics: Conference Series', issn='17426588', source_id='130053', eIssn='17426596', aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume='1321', issueIdentifier='3', article_number='032011', pageRange=None, description=\"This study aims to describe the ability of Technological, Pedagogical, and Content Knowledge of mathematics teachers and the way mathematics teachers use Technological, Pedagogical, and Content Knowledge in developing 21st-century students' skills through math learning.

One functional approach to innovation, Technology-Specific Innovation Systems (TSISs), places national HFC Technological Innovation Systems (TISs) within a framework of a global HFC TSIS. This analytical approach suggests that HFC innovation can start anywhere in space. However, in a case study of HFC innovation and diffusion in the UK covering sixty years’ activity, this theoretical assumption is challenged. Event history analysis and interviews using a neofunctionalist TSIS approach suggest that positive feedback was on the brink of occurring in the UK HFC TIS by 2012. When additional organisational and spatial indicators are added, the evidence on the ground does not support the aspatial assumptions that underlie TIS heuristic thinking.

Wind energy resources are one of the most promising avenues for renewable energy generation, and the field has experienced significant technological innovation and growth over the past few years. This paper reviews various issues related to wind-power generation resources. Current trends, over the last two decades, of increasing wind turbine sizes, rated power-generation capacity, efficiencies, and the actual size of wind farm facilities are projected to continue. It is theorized that the current global installed capacity of wind power generation may increase from the current generation of 540 (2017) to 5800 GW by 2050. Wind energy potential, in terms of vertical wind speed profile, mean wind-speed distribution, turbulence effects and gust, are discussed in detail in this paper. A decreasing trend in the cost of initial capital investment and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE), for both onshore and offshore wind-power generation developments, are projected to continue, although this is regionally and economy-size dependent. Key challenges have been identified for the development of wind power generation in developed and under-developed countries going forward. New approaches/developments in the field and avenues for further research or actions that can be undertaken are also outlined in this paper.

Neural engineers have advanced clinical frontiers by leveraging tools and discoveries in quantitative and biological sciences and through collaborations between engineering, science, and medicine. The movement toward bioelectronic medicines, where neuromodulation aims to supplement or replace pharmaceuticals to treat chronic medical conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes and psychiatric disorders is a prime example of a new frontier made possible by neural engineering.

FRP composites, as high strength, lightweight and high performance reinforcement materials, have been widely used not only in China, but also in foreign countries and in water and soil engineering. China has made a series of achievements in the development of high-performance FRP materials and their products suitable for civil engineering applications, and in the application of FRP key technologies in civil engineering. In the development of concrete structures in the new century, new requirements and challenges have been put forward for materials. Because FRP is a frontal composite material composed of many kinds of materials, its common advantages are light weight, high strength and elastic modulus, fatigue resistance, long service time, good corrosion resistance and low thermal expansion coefficient, etc. FPR is a new type of high performance material, which is of great significance to the sustainable development of civil engineering industry in our country.

Moreover, today considered among the most exciting carriers in the field of Transportation Design thanks to the positive effects their use has highlighted in the area of trade and territorial cohesion. The ferry has spread in Europe since the second half of the twentieth century, an era characterized by a relentless post-war economic recovery that favored the development of trade routes and shipbuilding. The ferry is the direct extension of road and rail networks over water in the absence of land infrastructure. It is no coincidence that it derives from the 'landing ship tank,' the ships built for amphibious operations that allowed soldiers and vehicles to land on the beach, from which it inherited its versatility and practicality as values of identity that distinguish the spirit of the journey. The study aims to bring out the most significant transformations inherent to the architectural form of the ship, through the analysis and comparison of selected unit drawings based on collective criteria, such as the type of cargo, the geographical area of service, etc. What matters most is reconstructing the evolution of the layout to understand the motivations that have guided the design choices to date. Among the many variables of a technical and stylistic nature, ferry design is extremely influenced by the social transformations and lifestyles of passengers. Recently, the use of the ferry has recorded a surge that has prompted shipping companies to increase the quality of services and entertainment onboard. Therefore, navigating on a ferry whose meaning has changed from a 'spartan' journey to a comfortable one, almost as a cruise ship. The comparison between engineering and architecture has become more relevant than ever for the construction of good ships. Thus, the next challenges will be dictated by sustainable innovation and the digital revolution, opening the door to new scenarios in the shipbuilding industry, which will again change the RoPax layout.\", authkeywords='design | future | layout | RoPax | transformations', citedby_count=1, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85074735429', doi='10.1080/17434440.2019.1685869', pii=None, pubmed_id='31657961', title='Clinical translation of the assets of biomedical engineering–a retrospective analysis with looks to the future', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Ren Y.', afid='60025488;60006027;60005121;123427151', affilname='The University of Utah;Universitair Medisch Centrum Groningen;The College of New Jersey;Willem Kolff Foundation (Kampen', affiliation_city='Salt Lake City;Groningen;Ewing;Zwolle', affiliation_country='United States;Netherlands;United States;Netherlands', author_count='7', author_names='Ren, Yijin;Fagette, Paul H.;Hall, Connie L.;Broers, Herman;Grainger, David W.;Van Der Mei, Henny C.;Busscher, Henk J.', author_ids='57203906506;6602879241;7403015657;23092916700;7102452602;7102850776;36041882500', author_afids='60006027;60006027;60005121;123427151;60025488;60006027;60006027', coverDate='2019-11-02', coverDisplayDate='2 November 2019', publicationName='Expert Review of Medical Devices', issn='17434440', source_id='79319', eIssn='17452422', aggregationType='Journal', volume='16', issueIdentifier='11', article_number=None, pageRange='913-922', description='Introduction: Biomedical-engineering (BME) plays a major role in modern medicine. Many BME-based assets have been brought to clinical translation in the twentieth century, but translation currently stagnates. Here, we compare the impact of past and present scientific, economic and societal climates on the translation of BME-based assets, in order to provide the BME-community with incentives to address current stagnation. Areas covered: In the twentieth century, W.J. Kolff brought kidney dialysis, the total artificial heart, artificial vision and limbs to clinical application. This success raises the question whether Kolff and other past giants of clinical translation had special mind-sets, or whether their problem selection, their training, or governmental and regulatory control played roles. Retrospective analysis divides the impact of BME-based assets to clinical application into three periods: 1900–1970: rapid translation from bench-to-bedside, 1970–1990: new diseases and increased governmental control, and the current translational crisis from 1990 onward. Expert opinion: Academic and societal changes can be discerned that are concurrent with BME’s translational success: mono-disciplinary versus multi-disciplinary training, academic reward systems based on individual achievements versus team achievements with strong leadership, increased governmental and regulatory control, and industrial involvement. From this, recommendations can be derived for accelerating clinical translation of BME-assets.', authkeywords='biomedical engineering | clinical impact | innovation | medical technology | Translational medicine | translational stagnation | valorization', citedby_count=10, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherhybridgold', freetoreadLabel='Hybrid Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85103725051', doi='10.18178/IJMERR.8.6.839-844', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Applying human-robot interaction technology in retail industries', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Joe W.Y.', afid='60279628;60031975', affilname='College of Engineering;Illinois State University', affiliation_city='Nashville;Chicago', affiliation_country='United States;United States', author_count='2', author_names='Joe, Woong Yeol;Song, So Young', author_ids='9735112900;56709093400', author_afids='60279628;60031975', coverDate='2019-11-01', coverDisplayDate='1 November 2019', publicationName='International Journal of Mechanical Engineering and Robotics Research', issn=None, source_id='21100788860', eIssn='22780149', aggregationType='Journal', volume='8', issueIdentifier='6', article_number=None, pageRange='839-844', description='This review of human-robot interaction technology (HRI) suggests how retailers can enhance customer service and improve their operations through the use of service robots.

However, while academic researchers often work under similar institutions, norms, and incentives, they vary greatly in how they organize their research efforts across different scientific domains. This heterogeneity, in turn, has important implications for innovation policy, the relationship between industry and academia, the scientific labor market, and the perceived deficit in the relevance of social sciences and humanities research. To understand this heterogeneity, we model scientists as publication-maximizing agents, identifying two distinct organizational patterns that are optimal under different parameters. When the net productivity of research staff (e.g., PhD students and postdocs) is positive, the funded research model with an entrepreneurial scientist and a large team dominates. When the costs of research staff exceed their productivity benefits, the hands-on research approach is optimal. The model implies significant heterogeneity across the two modes of organizing in research funding, supply of scientific workforce, team size, publication output, and stratification patterns over time. Exploratory empirical analysis finds consistent patterns of time allocation and publication in a prior survey of faculty in U.S. universities. Using data from an original survey, we also find causal effects consistent with the model's prediction on how negative shocks to research staff-due to visa or health problems, for example-differentially impact research output under the two modes of organization.\", authkeywords='Academic research | Collaboration | Performance heterogeneity | Research funding | Research relevance | Science policy | Scientific teams | University industry relationship', citedby_count=7, openaccess=0, freetoread='repositoryam', freetoreadLabel='Green', fund_acr='MIT', fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='Massachusetts Institute of Technology'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85082996554', doi='10.1109/ISCON47742.2019.9036182', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='A Study towards Current Trends, Issues and Challenges in Internet of Things (IoT) based System for Intelligent Energy Management', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Verma G.', afid='60079433', affilname='Madan Mohan Malaviya University of Technology', affiliation_city='Gorakhpur', affiliation_country='India', author_count='2', author_names='Verma, Garima;Prakash, Shiva', author_ids='57216269686;9245139000', author_afids='60079433;60079433', coverDate='2019-11-01', coverDisplayDate='November 2019', publicationName='2019 4th International Conference on Information Systems and Computer Networks, ISCON 2019', issn=None, source_id='21100977400', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number='9036182', pageRange='358-365', description=\"The Internet of Things (IOT) is a system which houses and interfaces gadgets, sensors, programming and system associations for gathering and trading information to assume responsibility for things on this globe.

The smart classroom also utilizes the connection of smart devices as a support so that teachers and students can approach various learning styles, participate interactively and share content. While the current smart classroom system mostly provide classroom environment, the proposed design of the smart classroom in this research will be consisted of designing a smart classroom system that covers distance learning activities under Smart Learning System (SLS) and in-class learning activities in Smart Teaching Environment (STE).SLS facilitates distance learning by enabling interactive teaching, customized learning, learning analysis, and ease of document access. STE is a class environment that utilizes a variety of smart devices to support in-class learning activities. By using Service Computing System Engineering Framework, SLS and STE will be integrated to fulfill the need for learning activities alignment in our education system by creating service innovation of smart attendance. While in-class students' attendance will be recorded by existing attendance recording methods, distance learning students' attendance will be recorded by applying smart attendance in SLS utilizing artificial intelligence to trigger randomized pop-up quizzes for attendance evidence. The result of the randomized quiz submissions will be validated for attendance student report based on defined parameters of class attendance. This proposed design of the smart classroom will be evaluated by calculating the cohesion and coupling degrees as evaluation principles for service-oriented software design. In conclusion, the proposed smart classroom has a main vision to ease the implementation of learning activities within in-class and distance learning by integrating STE and SLS to provide a valid attendance record for student and education system regulation.\", authkeywords='Distance Learning | In-Class Learning | Learning Activities | Smart Attendance | Smart Classroom | Smart Learning System | Smart Teaching Environment', citedby_count=14, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85079215734', doi='10.1109/UBMYK48245.2019.8965533', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='A Paper Recommendation System Based on User Interest and Citations', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Bulut B.', afid='60004863', affilname='Firat Üniversitesi', affiliation_city='Elazig', affiliation_country='Turkey', author_count='3', author_names='Bulut, Betul;Kaya, Buket;Kaya, Mehmet', author_ids='57204816977;56007849900;35890569200', author_afids='60004863;60004863;60004863', coverDate='2019-11-01', coverDisplayDate='November 2019', publicationName='1st International Informatics and Software Engineering Conference: Innovative Technologies for Digital Transformation, IISEC 2019 - Proceedings', issn=None, source_id='21100944627', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number='8965533', pageRange=None, description=\"It is difficult for researchers to access useful scientific articles from an excessive number of articles.

During the sample period, MFCI is able to maintain a consistency trend with the development of the real economy (EC) and is ahead of changes in the real economy. The asymmetric correlation test based on MF-ADCCA algorithm shows that MFCI has a persistent cross-correlation with EC. The decline of MFCI will lead to the decline of EC, and the rise of MFCI will lead to the rise of EC. The cross-effect of MFCI on EC changes the asymmetric influence of the individual sequence itself, indicating that the impact of China's financial situation on the development of the real economy exists, and MFCI has a predictive effect on the development of the real economy.

Then, we constructed a coordinated development index (CDI) of UTA to measure the level of sustainability of new-type urbanization.

Business ventures today are more and more networked. Often, various partners are needed to deliver a service or product to frequently cross-linked customers with sometimes bi- or even multi-variant roles. Furthermore, business models are embedded in socio-technical systems where different kinds of needs and values of all actors, including social, ecological, technical and economic values, have to be balanced. The resulting complex network of actors, needs and values requires continuous management in order to create and operate viable and sustainable business models. This paper proposes a multi-layer framework to analyze existing business models as well as to shape new business ventures in a networked and values-based way and to support the identification of tacit network effects within business ecosystems. Based on an existing multi-layered analysis toolkit, focusing on legal and business dynamics aspects, an enhanced visualization and analysis tool is proposed that focuses especially on ethical, social and environmental aspects to foster the creation of (strongly) sustainable business models. The research process to create the presented approach followed the Design Science Research paradigm by applying argumentative-deductive analysis (ADA) and first applications in real-world case studies. A practical case from an international Open Source Software (OSS) project serves as an example to illustrate this values-based visualization and analysis layer and its benefits for managers and decision makers in the area of business model and information system management.', authkeywords='Business model innovation | Design science research | Information systems engineering | Sustainable business models', citedby_count=12, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85074326826', doi='10.1007/s11858-019-01100-5', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='The Role of Mathematics in interdisciplinary STEM education', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Maass K.', afid='60024395;60014586;60010679;60009602', affilname='Pädagogische Hochschule Freiburg;Universidad de Jaén;Australian Catholic University;University of Limerick', affiliation_city='Freiburg im Breisgau;Jaen;Sydney;Limerick', affiliation_country='Germany;Spain;Australia;Ireland', author_count='4', author_names='Maass, Katja;Geiger, Vince;Ariza, Marta Romero;Goos, Merrilyn', author_ids='36008822000;6507540226;56181662500;7005104936', author_afids='60024395;60010679;60014586;60009602', coverDate='2019-11-01', coverDisplayDate='1 November 2019', publicationName='ZDM - Mathematics Education', issn='18639690', source_id='21100217601', eIssn='18639704', aggregationType='Journal', volume='51', issueIdentifier='6', article_number=None, pageRange='869-884', description='In times of rapid technological innovation and global challenges, the development of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) competencies becomes important.

This trend serves to highlight the urgent need for action in relation to STEM education. While it is widely acknowledged that mathematics underpins all other STEM disciplines, there is clear evidence it plays an understated role in integrated STEM education.

In this research, for the treatment of wastewater containing methylene blue, a novel process was introduced in which a hybrid of ultrasound and photocatalysis was used. ZnO nanoparticle was employed as the catalyst. A synthesis technique for ZnO nanoparticles was used, and the resulted nanoparticle was capable of conducting photocatalytic activity in the visible light spectrum. Since the efficiency of a photocatalytic process in strongly dependent on the characteristics of the nanoparticle, in this study, the synthesis temperature parameter along with other parameters (that affect the ultrasonic/photocatalytic hybrid process such as pH, nanoparticle concentration, ultrasonic power, light source power, dye concentration, and time) were investigated as independent variables. Since treatment cost plays an important role in the selection for a proper treatment process, the cost of energy consumed in the hybrid process was chosen as the dependent variable. Examining the simultaneous effect of independent variables on the cost was one of the innovations of this research. Another novel aspect of this research is the determination of the synergetic or antagonistic effects of independent variables on each other. Furthermore, the optimal conditions to reach the optimum energy consumption level were also determined.

The co-authorship data provides evidence of greater collaboration of MSU with non-African countries on African-focused research but a growing number of partner institutions from African countries. This growing collaboration provides significant benefits on strategic research conducted and its impact, as well as increasing the recognition of African researchers as contributors to impactful international research collaborations and improving the ability of MSU and its global and African partners to co-generate knowledge and innovation that can help solve global problems more effectively.

Numerous research studies have mainly sought to modify these surfaces through physical, chemical and biological means to ease early endothelial cell (EC) adhesion, migration and proliferation, and eventually to build an endothelial layer on the surfaces. The first priority for surface modification is inhibition of protein adsorption that leads to inhibition of platelet adhesion to the device surfaces, which may favor EC adhesion. Surface modification through surface texturing, if applicable, can bring some hopeful outcomes in this regard. Surface modifications through chemical and/or biological means may play a significant role in easy endothelialization of cardiovascular devices and inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation. Cellular engineering of cells relevant to endothelialization can boost the positive outcomes obtained through surface engineering.

The aim of the present study is therefore to employ a systematic review to investigate the state-of-the-art of those approaches that leverage creativity in requirements elicitation within Agile Software Development, as well as the benefits, limitations and strength of evidence of these approaches.

The selected studies contained 13 different and unique proposals. These approaches provide evidence that enhanced creativity in requirements elicitation can be successfully implemented in real software projects. We specifically observed that projects related to user interface development, such as those for mobile or web applications, are good candidates for the use of these approaches. We have also found that agile methodologies such as Scrum, Extreme Programming or methodologies based on rapid modelling are preferred when introducing creativity into requirements elicitation. Despite this being a new research field, there is a mixture of techniques, tools and processes that have already been and are currently being successfully tested in industry.

While growing literature has explored the effects of technological progress on environmental quality, fewer studies have considered the varied effects exerted by different technological progress paths on PM2.5 concentrations. This paper explored the relationship between two different kinds of technological progress (indigenous innovation and technology diffusion) and PM2.5 concentrations. Indigenous innovation was in this study considered to be composed by research and development investment (R&D) and import technology (IM); technology diffusion was represented by foreign direction investment (FDI) and export learning effect represent (EX). A panel data model was employed in order to explore the varied impact of these different technological progress paths on PM2.5 concentrations, using data for 48 cities located in China's three most developed urban agglomerations (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Pearl River Delta), for the period 2000–2015. The results reveal that without control variables, FDI had a significant negative impact on PM2.5 levels in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, and EX a significant positive impact. FDI, R&D, and EX were found to positively correlate with PM2.5 levels in the Yangtze River Delta. In Pearl River Delta, R&D presented a significant negative relationship.

The hysteresis variable governs the nonlinear dynamics of the proposed model in which the regime switch can be delayed if the hysteresis variable lies in a hysteresis zone. The proposed setup combines three useful model components for modeling economic and financial data: (1) the multivariate HAR model, (2) the multivariate hysteretic volatility models, and (3) a dynamic conditional correlation structure.

It requires specialised and interdisciplinary skills, as well as knowledge for innovation of new product development. New product development has four key phases: need finding, concept generation, engineering and validation. The first two phases require broad vertical and lateral thinking to come up with innovative plus appropriate solutions. Thus, multidisciplinary teams made up of experienced individuals with interdisciplinary knowledge enhance the phase outputs. The next two phases are iterative, usually requiring management of multiple subsystems, across technical disciplines and system integration. Without interdisciplinary product members and technical leaders, product development is not optimised. This leads to numerous iterations - loss of time, money. The industry struggles to find these interdisciplinary resources and building this capacity today takes a decade in India, with the entire burden falling on the industry. In well-developed medical device markets, higher education has introduced application-centric courses with cross-disciplinary curriculums. Such a structure allows students to gain valuable skills and understanding of the industry as a whole. Developed ecosystems have no shortage of experts available who serve as technical leaders.

Although interest in interdisciplinary research is growing, it is still confronted with significant obstacles stemming from difficulties in establishing a common understanding. While others have evaluated interdisciplinary in a top-down funding-oriented ex ante manner or a result-oriented ex post manner, this focus paper intends to create a framework that enables the measurement of interdisciplinary understanding within a group. Therefore, using the case of the interdisciplinary Boysen-TU Dresden Research Group, a framework for measuring interdisciplinary understanding (MIU) is presented. The basis of the framework is the development of dimensions based on the specific composition and requirements of the interdisciplinary group. With this framework, two main contributions are provided. First, interdisciplinary understanding within a research group can be measured with respect to the defined dimensions. Through discussions on the differences of the understanding of projects over the dimensions, it is possible to establish a common understanding of projects. Second, the interdisciplinarity within a group or interdisciplinary distance between two specific research projects can be evaluated in order to identify possible difficulties in understanding, as well as recognizing potentials for interdisciplinary research. The MIU framework and the dimensions established in this paper can be adapted and transferred to any interdisciplinary research group to improve joint understanding of researchers and enable them to tackle complex techno-societal problems of the future.

Engineering educators may need to do more to ensure creativity is explicitly addressed as an expected learning outcome within engineering syllabi. Background: Prior studies have shown inclusion of creativity within engineering syllabi and course activities are generally limited. Students may perceive educators do not value creativity, and their studies have limited influence on their creative skills. Studies conflict on whether creativity skills increase over completing an engineering degree. Creativity has been demonstrated to be an important skill for engineering professionals, but one not necessarily appropriately addressed in engineering programs. Few studies have attempted to quantify coverage of creativity material on a nation-wide scale, as opposed to in a single or select few institutions. Research Questions: 1) To what extent do engineering educators explicitly articulate creativity and innovation-related learning goals and material on their course syllabi? and 2) To what extent do engineering educators explicitly articulate exposure to, or instruction in the use of, creativity heuristics within their course syllabi? Methodology: The online publicly accessible course outlines of 1109 compulsory courses from 42 degree programs accredited by two national engineering accreditation bodies were qualitatively analyzed in a two-stage approach using document analysis. Findings: Approximately 2% of compulsory electrical engineering course outlines explicitly articulate creativity-related material; only one course articulated engaging students in using creativity heuristics.', authkeywords='Creativity | electrical engineering | engineering curriculum | innovation | undergraduate', citedby_count=25, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85065704433', doi='10.1016/j.respol.2019.04.012', pii='S0048733319301039', pubmed_id=None, title='Studying transitions: Past, present, and future', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Zolfagharian M.', afid='60032882;60019578;60018815', affilname='Technische Universiteit Eindhoven;Monash University;Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development', affiliation_city='Eindhoven;Melbourne;Utrecht', affiliation_country='Netherlands;Australia;Netherlands', author_count='4', author_names='Zolfagharian, Mohammadreza;Walrave, Bob;Raven, Rob;Romme, A.

Participatory design (PD), a method that utilizes the involvement of patients and other stakeholders, is well-suited for the design of multifaceted interventions in complex work systems, such as community pharmacies, that have diverse and dynamic end-users. Objective: The objective is to describe a blueprint for how to use PD when designing a community pharmacy intervention. This paper outlines the steps of PD and highlights the advantages and disadvantages of this method. Methods: PD is explained step-wise to underscore the considerations required of researchers unfamiliar with PD. This includes the development of a tailored PD approach, PD session preparatory work, data collection, and intervention development and evaluation. The stakeholders recruited for the community pharmacy intervention were pharmacy staff and older adult patients who received prescriptions at the pharmacy corporation in which the intervention was being implemented. The PD process was a series of six adaptive sessions: (1) problem identification, (2) solution generation, (3) convergence, (4) prototyping, (5) initial evaluation, and (6) formative evaluation. Results: A description of the PD process to design a community pharmacy intervention is provided. The process led to the development of a patient-centered prototype. The advantages of using PD included the opportunity to clarify problems faced by stakeholders, generation of novel solutions to incorporate into the intervention, and the ability to vet and fine-tune stakeholder design ideas in an iterative fashion. The insight gained was unprecedented and invaluable to the researchers. The biggest challenge of employing PD was the time-sensitive and time-intensive nature of developing each session, collecting data, and reflecting on the results in order to design subsequent sessions. Conclusions: The PD process led to the development of a patient-centered prototype. PD enabled stakeholders to generate creative solutions and provide unique insight on addressing issues faced in healthcare redesign research and specifically in community pharmacies.', authkeywords='Community pharmacy | Dissemination and implementation | Human factors engineering | Medication safety | Participatory design | System redesign', citedby_count=32, openaccess=0, freetoread='repositoryam', freetoreadLabel='Green', fund_acr='AHRQ', fund_no='R18HS024490', fund_sponsor='Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85051407122', doi='10.1109/TEM.2018.2859162', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='The Role of Innovation Ecosystems and Social Capital in Startup Survival', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Bandera C.', afid='60022904', affilname='New Jersey Institute of Technology', affiliation_city='Newark', affiliation_country='United States', author_count='2', author_names='Bandera, Cesar;Thomas, Ellen', author_ids='6603770074;25959422500', author_afids='60022904;60022904', coverDate='2019-11-01', coverDisplayDate='November 2019', publicationName='IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management', issn='00189391', source_id='17359', eIssn='15580040', aggregationType='Journal', volume='66', issueIdentifier='4', article_number='8428534', pageRange='542-551', description=\"Innovation ecosystems, including technology parks and incubators, endeavor to achieve a high density of startups that is rich in social capital to help tenants evolve.

We present a startup survival model that distinguishes between access to social capital and using it. Empirical tests with the longitudinal Kauffman Firm Survey find that those startups that use social capital by collaborating with other agents (universities, industries, and government organizations) significantly outperform startups that do not. However, we also observe that the amount of social capital available in an ecosystem counterintuitively does not correlate with a tenant's use of it, and correlates weakly with longer life expectancy. These results are moderated by whether the tenant is a high-tech startup or not. Findings contribute to extant research in innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystems.

We find two deployment strategies: Required adoption, in which subsidiaries are required to adopt innovations, and voluntary adoption, in which adoption is not compulsory-innovations are showcased, but the adoption decision is left to the subsidiaries. We have investigated the factors influencing deployment, including the decentralized nature of service innovation, fit with the internal and external context, extrinsic and intrinsic motivations, and handovers.

Using results obtained from 108 research and development teams from six high-tech organizations, our findings show two ways to achieve radical innovation performance. Both are characterized by a high level of exploration; however, the level of exploitation and of learning behavior in each of them is either high or low. Against our expectations, promotion focus does not modify the effect of exploration and exploitation on radical innovation performance.

However, their analysis has a predominantly descriptive form of separate stages, processes, and procedures, and is not formed on the framework of clear criteria and indicators. Fundamental science and technology innovations, based on qualitatively new physical principles, make it possible to significantly increase the efficiency of the whole social production and the social spheres of society. The life cycle of fundamental science and technology innovations is a structurally and functionally complex integrated system which includes the birth of ideas for future innovative products, the process of their materialization, material realization, and later, the operation and disposal processes due to the depletion of their consumer properties. This study determines the critical points in the system of forming and implementing the life cycle of fundamental science and technology innovations as a single integrated process in the form of specific indicator gauges. These points determine the time parameters and characteristics of the life cycle of the fundamental scientific and technological innovations, its efficiency and quality. Future products start to become obsolete the moment the idea of them is generated. The authors conceptually determined that the process of a scientifically novel idea becoming obsolete can be described by an exponential curve. This is presented in the corresponding graph. The authors determined the life cycle stages of the fundamental scientific and technological innovations and established that the pre-production stage presents an opportunity to use combination effects during two or more stages of the life cycle and to use iteration procedures. This creates new possibilities for raising the efficiency and quality of the life cycle, contributing to a significant reduction in the level of various kinds of risks.

Design/methodology/approach: This is a concept paper where a theoretical “thought experiment” is done, using future thinking principles and data that originate from the literature. Findings: A conceptual mind model is developed to facilitate a better understanding of complexity at the edge of innovation where intelligent machines will emerge as innovators of the cyber world. It was found that innovation will gradually evolve from a human-only activity, to human–machine co-innovation, to incidences of autonomous machine innovation, based on the growth of machine intelligence and the adoption of human–machine partnership management models in future. Research limitations/implications: Very little information is available in the literature on intelligent machines doing innovation. The work is based on a theoretical approach that presents new concepts to be debated, but have not been tested in engineering and technology management practice, except for a conference presentation and academic discussion. Practical implications: The current world view is that future “smartness” is only possible through the creative abilities that humans have, but as machines are entering the workplace and our daily lives, not only as static robots on a manufacturing line, but as intelligent systems with the potential to replace lawyers and accountants, doctors and teachers, companions and partners, their role in innovation in complex environments needs to be explored. Social implications: Human–machine interaction is often an emotional social issue of concern in terms of the replacement of human intelligence with machine intelligence. It should be asked whether humans will or should remain in control of innovation? Artificial intelligence (AI) may complement and even substitute human intelligence, but huge value is embedded in the new goods, services and innovations AI will enable, especially in manufacturing, where value embedded in the project becomes complex and dynamic.

However, research on business models affected through Industry 4.0, and on small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), remains scarce. In response, the purpose of this paper is to address both aspects, further elaborating on the role that SMEs can take toward Industry 4.0 as provider or user. Design/methodology/approach: The paper used an exploratory research design based on 43 in-depth expert interviews within the three most important German industry sectors, mechanical and plant engineering, electrical engineering and automotive suppliers. Interviews were conducted with leading personnel of the respective enterprises, including 22 CEOs. They assign business model implications through Industry 4.0, referring to the Business Model Canvas, while the paper delineates between Industry 4.0 providers and users. Findings: The paper finds that key resources and value proposition are among the most affected elements of the business model, whereas channels are the least affected. Furthermore, distinct characteristics between Industry 4.0 providers and users can be delineated. In general, Industry 4.0 providers’ business models are significantly more affected than users, except for key partners and customer relationships. Research limitations/implications: Industry 4.0 remains at its early stages of implementation. As a result, many interviewees’ answers remain at a rather general level.

Although many scholars have studied the impact of political competition among local governments on the environmental governance effect, they have paid less attention to the internal mechanism of the environmental benefits arising from political competition. Under the two scenarios of considering and not considering political competition, this paper uses Stackelberg game theory and optimization theory to analyse enterprises' optimal green technology innovation strategies. In addition, the impact of key factors is analysed based on the decision-making modes of cost-sharing and revenue-sharing, without cost-sharing and revenue-sharing, and centralized decision-making. This paper draws the following main conclusions: (1) Considering the influence of political competition, the optimal green technology innovation strategies of local governments and enterprises differ for different modes. (2) Political competition not only directly affects enterprises' optimal level of green technology innovation but also indirectly affects it by influencing the optimal investment ratio of environmental governance. The inverted U-shaped relationship between political competition and enterprises' optimal level of green technology innovation is related to the incentive coefficient of local government investment behaviour set by the central government. Controlling for the relative size of the incentive coefficient of local government investment in environmental governance and economic development can promote the positive impact of political competition on enterprises' optimal level of green technology innovation. (3) The decision-making mode of enterprises and local governments and environmental decentralization have significant effects on the optimal level of green technology innovation, which should be considered when the central government formulates effective environmental policies.\", authkeywords='Environmental decentralization | Green technology innovation | Political competition | Stackelberg game theory', citedby_count=101, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='NSFC', fund_no='71573283', fund_sponsor='National Natural Science Foundation of China'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85074642391', doi='10.3389/fmats.2019.00260', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Oxygen Defects and Surface Chemistry of Reducible Oxides', subtype='re', subtypeDescription='Review', creator='Pinto F.M.', afid='60027294;60017841', affilname='Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná;Universidade Federal de Lavras', affiliation_city='Curitiba;Lavras', affiliation_country='Brazil;Brazil', author_count='4', author_names='Pinto, F.

Consequently, the objective of this study is to identify criteria necessary for measuring sustainable construction project performance and to elicit perceptions of their relative importance. Thorough review of related studies were deployed to generate a set of factors that makes construction project habitable, attractive and liveable, and also, factors for measuring construction project performance. A total of 87 questionnaires were distributed to seven (7) main groups of project participants namely; client, project manager, architect, quantity surveyor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer and builder/civil/structural engineer who participated on nine (9) case study projects. The survey findings indicate that quality performance and productivity both with 81.6% of importance, innovation with 80.4% of importance, health and safety with 80.2% of importance and client's satisfaction with 80% of importance are the most important factors to consider while measuring sustainable construction project performance. For a construction project to be habitable, safety and incident risk, acoustic comfort and visual comfort are the most important factors to consider. When considering how attractive construction project should be, art in architecture, unique style, terrain choice and harmonious surrounding are the most important factors to consider. Also, when considering the liveability of a construction project, space efficiency, ventilation and public accessibility are the most important factors to consider. Finally, this research recommended that the factors listed above, are key factors to consider at the design stage of any construction project for both the designer and the regulatory agencies, and these factors are to be monitored throughout the construction process since they are vital in measuring the performance of any sustainable construction project to infer a more desirable and satisfactory sustainable building.\", authkeywords=None, citedby_count=3, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85073005325', doi='10.1021/jacs.9b10441', pii=None, pubmed_id='31580654', title='Erratum: Synthesis of Modified Nucleoside Oligophosphates Simplified: Fast, Pure, and Protecting Group Free (J.

The masonry infills constructed in this way experience an unplanned interaction with the surrounding RC frame and thus become part of the horizontal load-bearing system with in-plane loading. This interaction combined with seismically induced loads perpendicular to the infill panel often leads to total collapses of the masonry infills and heavy damages to the RC frames. This fact was the motivation to develop an innovative system for decoupling the RC frame and the masonry infill with a special profile made of elastomeric cellular material within the collaborative European research project INSYSME (Innovative Systems for Earthquake Resistant Masonry Enclosures in Reinforced Concrete Buildings). The profile allows relative displacements between the RC frame and the masonry infill and serves at the same time as a support for out-of-plane loads. The article first explains the design and installation of the system and provides an overview of the load bearing capacities determined through small specimen tests on the system components. Subsequently, fundamental experimental investigations on traditional and decoupled RC frames infilled with high thermal insulating clay bricks for separate and combined in-plane \\u202cand out-of-plane loading are presented.

Thus, indices for generating energy will always be a valid reason for research. It therefore stands to reason that; numerous experimental effort has been devoted to the quest of energy generation. This quest has witnessed a lot of progression, newer innovations being an improvement over older editions. Recent energy studies have shifted its focus from dominant monocrystalline silicon solar cells to organic material sources. This is in the wake of the high expenses incurred in installation of any silicon solar technology. Although the economy of scale applies to increased use of silicon panels, it does not delete the looming future threat of disposal of expired silicon solar panels. This brings to fore, a need for an energy substitute that possesses the salient attributes of monocrystalline silicon solar cells without the limitations. Amongst all the alternatives, the low cost and environmentally benign dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) has remained prominent. Other desirable characteristics of dye-sensitized solar cells is all-year availability of raw materials, capacity to perform under low diffuse light conditions, ability to withstand extreme conditions contrary to their silicon counterparts are sterling qualities which necessitate detailed enquiry into dye-sensitized solar technology. In spite of these excellent properties, wide adoption of DSCs is limited by its poor output efficiency relative to monocrystalline silicon solar cells. The significance of this research is thus to investigate optical spectral responses of S.Anisatum dye-sensitized solar cells with an objective to analyze its photovoltaic output and prospect for micro-energy production. Preliminary phytochemical analysis portends S.Anisatum dye as rich in phenols. UV/VIS spectroscopy reveals a porphyrin characteristic absorbance. This research corroborates previousstudies such as photovoltaic output of B.spectabilis DSCs to different electrolytes. The spectral responses revealed 0.065 mA, 140 mV, 5.32 X 10-6 W and 0.86 % respectively as Isc, Voc, Pmax and η highest output value. Although this result is comparatively low to monocrystalline silicon panels, it conforms with existing standard porphyrin efficiency.

The current study presents a moderated mediation model and examines the mechanisms and conditions involved in TMX-IWB relationship. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative research methodology was adopted where 156 engineering and management students (grouped into 33 teams) were given a task in the form of an assignment to be completed in three weeks’ timeframe. Post task, perceptions about TMX and IWB of members were captured using a questionnaire and the innovative output of each team was assessed using multi-rater technique. Findings: Psychological empowerment fully mediates TMX’s effect on team member's IWB. Furthermore, the results indicate that creative self-efficacy moderates the mediated path from TMX to IWB via psychological empowerment. The mediating effect of psychological empowerment is stronger when creative self-efficacy of a team member is higher. Furthermore, the relation between group-level innovative behaviour and the team's innovative output has been established. Originality/value: The current research has contributed to the limited literature on team performance and management. This paper has uniquely investigated psychological empowerment in the context of TMX and IWB. The paper has encapsulated the theoretical and practical underpinnings of the mediated effect of psychological empowerment on team members' innovation-oriented behaviour.\", authkeywords='Leadership processes | Leadership skills | Organizational assessment | Systematic innovation', citedby_count=25, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85082051528', doi='10.3233/FAIA190244', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Research on experimental teaching of virtual and real welding technology and engineering specialty', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Yang H.', afid='60019616', affilname='Harbin Institute of Technology', affiliation_city='Harbin', affiliation_country='China', author_count='5', author_names='Yang, Haifeng;Liu, Fa;Zhou, Wei Jia;Zhao, Hongyun;Zhong, Bo', author_ids='57198828511;57215841897;56783329500;55650615900;14053286500', author_afids='60019616;60019616;60019616;60019616;60019616', coverDate='2019-10-02', coverDisplayDate='2 October 2019', publicationName='Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications', issn='09226389', source_id='19500157321', eIssn='18798314', aggregationType='Book Series', volume='320', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='739-745', description=\"Experimental teaching as a process of applying theoretical knowledge to practice, aims to cultivate students' ability to observe things and develop the scientific spirit of continuous in-depth study and innovation.

Higher education institutions need to provide a wide range of engineers with an increasing level of cross-disciplinary skills. An active, local presence of a university providing degree programs and research in technology has a strong link with the volume and development of the technology industry in the region. While modern technologies, especially information and communication technology (ICT), allow research and development activities to be independent of the location, other sectors of technology industry, such as maritime industry, require significant investments in physical facilities, bound to the region. Governments face two main challenges to maintain their industry's engineering competitiveness: (1) to prepare engineering graduates across expanding ranges of skills and knowledge, and (2) to provide the engineers in the regions where these skills are needed. Southwestern Finland is a region with the fastest growing technology industry in the country. Without a university with a full range of opportunities for academic engineering education in the region, there is an increasing number of job openings that cannot be filled. In Finland, students in engineering connect with the industry already during their studies and, after graduation, tend to stay in the region where they studied. To expose engineering students to the challenges of Southwestern Finland without creating new permanent higher education engineering structures in the region, the Finnish government in 2017 launched FITech, a 5-year project including all the seven Finnish universities offering engineering education. The purpose of FITech is to offer a nationwide cooperative solution to coordinate and provide engineering education and research in all domains of engineering to support the growth of Southwestern Finland region. This paper introduces the foundations and objectives of FITech and using the early indications of its results suggests a framework to evaluate the success of this complex nationwide project.

Activities of foresight are suited to support product developers in their daily activities of product development. The basis for this is the model of PGE-Product Generation Engineering [2]. Product development processes described by the model of PGE always rely on a reference system and distinguish between adoption variation, shape variation and principle variation. The use of foresight in a systematic approach translates the findings of the derived future scenarios into short-term, medium-term and long-term recommendations for action [13]. This approach supports product developers to generate knowledge about future developments as well as to minimize risks by identifying innovation potential. Until now, the recommendations for action are mainly descriptive without any use of probabilities of occurrence of future events. An estimation of these probabilities of occurrence of scenarios could generate further knowledge about the future development and therefore assist product developers in decisions during the early stage of the product development process more effectively.

The combination of p-hifu technology and MRI technology improves the accuracy and safety of treatment, but the combination of the two brings about non-negligible electromagnetic interference problems. Most EMC problems can be solved by electromagnetic shielding. Based on previous studies, this paper intends to study a novel electromagnetic shielding material Cu-Epoxy for ultrasonic transducers.The biggest innovation of this material is its dual functions- electromagnetic shielding and ultrasonic matching layer.We conduct preliminary simulation with Comsol software to verify its feasibility. Through the simulation of electromagnetic field and piezoelectric effect, we find that this material is feasible in theoretical design. The biggest advantage of this simulation model is that it can be used for theoretical design of composite materials and explore the optimization of their performance.

This significant increment of URN can be explained by the remarkable growth of maritime traffic in recent years and the greater number of seismic explorations in the oceans. In relation to this issue, the current elevated level of underwater radiated noise in the oceans is producing a negative impact on marine fauna as it is happening with the Southern Resident Killer Whale (SRKW) in the Salish Sea in the west border between Canada and the USA. In the short-term, these high levels of URN block animal's ability to communicate, navigate, reproduce or hunt; while in the long-term, it may cause hearing loss in them. Hence, it is urgent to control the elevated level of URN in the oceans to protect the marine fauna and ensuring the sustainability of the sea environment. The majority of the underwater radiated noise produced by ships in the oceans originates from propellers, engines and auxiliary machinery. The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) Report No; 209 was created with the aim to establish certain limit values on the URN generated by ships. The main purpose of this analysis is to avoid the negative effects of the URN on the sea environment and protect to the marine fauna of the vessel echosounders interferences focusing on the design and build of silent ships by means of a noise and vibration comprehensive management methodology. The scientific community has demonstrated that the anthropogenic noise produced by the shipping sector is the main responsible for the relevant growth of the URN in the oceans which causes negative effects on marine life [2]. As a result, a benchmarking study has been addressed by Canada to inform about the negative impacts of URN in the marine environment and propose the creation of new regulatory policies on URN reduction. This exploratory study has been carried out by a specialized steering committee which is composed of a network of organizations with a proven record in RD and innovation activities in shipping URN. This technical study is in line with IMO conclusions for the reduction of URN from commercial shipping to address adverse impacts on marine life (MEPC.1/Circ.833; MEPC 74/17/2; MEPC 74/INF.36) representing the greatest challenge for the protection of the marine fauna in the oceans. To deal with the challenge of URN reduction in the oceans, the technological experiences accumulated over the years in the dynamic and acoustical design of modern Fishing Research Vessels (FRV) and Oceanographic Research Vessels (ORV) can be extrapolated to the rest of marine sectors. The main objective of this study is to identify which type of actions can be potentially used to manage and minimize URN generated by ships in the oceans without affecting the marine traffic and the transport of goods. The main idea is to design a new generation of 'Silent Ships' in compliance not only with the strictest Comfort Class Notation requirements but also with the most restrictive URN requirements such as ICES No 209. The overall URN level of a ship at certain operational speed is the combination of the noise spectral component generated by different URN sources such as the main engine and the propeller. Consequently, the reduction of the overall URN level will imply preventive actions for each one of the dominant URN sources. In summary, it can be concluded that a drastic reduction of the underwater radiated noise in the oceans is of vital importance to guarantee the sustainability of the sea environment and protect marine life. Thus, it is necessary to promote the design of a new generation of silent vessels using the most advanced engineering technology developed for the minimization of URN.\", authkeywords='Engineering | Marine | Noise | Silent | Standards | Thresholds | URN | Vessels | Whales', citedby_count=1, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85078745644', doi='10.1109/MPRV.2019.2947974', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Next Generation IoT: Toward Ubiquitous Autonomous Cost-Efficient IoT Devices', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Youssef M.', afid='60033041;60028333', affilname='Alexandria University;UNSW Sydney', affiliation_city='Alexandria;Sydney', affiliation_country='Egypt;Australia', author_count='2', author_names='Youssef, Moustafa;Hassan, Mahbub', author_ids='7102125877;57193695191', author_afids='60033041;60028333', coverDate='2019-10-01', coverDisplayDate='October-December 2019', publicationName='IEEE Pervasive Computing', issn='15361268', source_id='25022', eIssn='15582590', aggregationType='Journal', volume='18', issueIdentifier='4', article_number='8968800', pageRange='8-11', description='IoT enables a new set of novel applications that promise to transform the physical world as we know it today.

Traditionally, statistical methods were used; recently, machine learning techniques, in particular neural networks, have been proposed to solve the multi-class classification problem. In this paper, we develop radial basis function (RBF)-based neural network schemes for single-label and multi-label classification, respectively. The number of hidden nodes and the parameters involved with the basis functions are determined automatically by applying an iterative self-constructing clustering algorithm to the given training dataset, and biases and weights are derived optimally by least squares.

Nonetheless, it has also become evident that the current AAV vector generation will require improvements in transduction potency, antibody evasion and cell/tissue specificity to allow the use of lower and safer vector doses. To this end, others and we devoted substantial previous research to the implementation and application of key technologies for engineering of next-generation viral capsids in a high-Throughput 'top-down' or (semi-)rational 'bottom-up' approach.

The article concludes that there is a need for a broad, national co-ordinating policy that encourages universities and industry to collaborate, particularly on research, and to engage in the transference and commercialisation of technology.', authkeywords='Efficiency | Egypt | Factor-driven economy | National policy | Technology transfer', citedby_count=30, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85063761859', doi='10.1016/j.respol.2019.03.018', pii='S0048733319300812', pubmed_id=None, title='The digital transformation of innovation and entrepreneurship: Progress, challenges and key themes', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Nambisan S.', afid='60025111;60015150;60000305', affilname='The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill;Imperial College London;Case Western Reserve University', affiliation_city='Chapel Hill;London;Cleveland', affiliation_country='United States;United Kingdom;United States', author_count='3', author_names='Nambisan, Satish;Wright, Mike;Feldman, Maryann', author_ids='55946896600;7401558861;7402261132', author_afids='60000305;60015150;60025111', coverDate='2019-10-01', coverDisplayDate='October 2019', publicationName='Research Policy', issn='00487333', source_id='22900', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='48', issueIdentifier='8', article_number='103773', pageRange=None, description='The emergence of novel and powerful digital technologies, digital platforms and digital infrastructures has transformed innovation and entrepreneurship in significant ways.

Research aimed at understanding the digital transformation of the economy needs to incorporate multiple and cross-levels of analysis, embrace ideas and concepts from multiple fields/disciplines, and explicitly acknowledge the role of digital technologies in transforming organizations and social relationships. To help realize this research agenda, we identify three key themes related to digitization—openness, affordances, and generativity—and, outline broad research issues relating to each. We suggest that such themes that are innate to digital technologies could serve as a common conceptual platform that allows for connections between issues at different levels as well as the integration of ideas from different disciplines/areas.

Nanofabrication methods have received growing interest in recent years as a means of recapitulating these elements within the ECM. Near-field electrospinning (NFES) is a versatile fibre deposition method, capable of layer-by-layer nano-fabrication. The maximum layer height is generally limited in layer-by-layer NFES as a consequence of electrostatic effects of the polymer at the surface, due to residual charge and polymer dielectric properties. This restricts the total volume achievable by layer-by-layer techniques. Surpassing this restriction presents a complex challenge, leading to research innovations aimed at increasing patterning precision, and achieving a translation from 2D to 3D additive nanofabrication. Here we investigated a means of achieving this translation through the use of 3D electrode substrates. This was addressed by in-house developed technology in which selective laser melt manufactured standing pillar electrodes were combined with a direct suspension near-field electrospinning (SNFES) technique, which implements an automated platform to manoeuvre the pillar electrodes around the emitter in order to suspend fibres in the free space between the electrode support structures. In this study SNFES was used in multiple operation modes, investigating the effects of varying process parameters, as well as pattern variations on the suspended nanoarrays.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on the data obtained from Chinese high-tech firms, the hypotheses are tested by using hierarchical multiple regressions. Findings: This study identifies two types of network capabilities: network structural capability and network relational capability. The findings suggest that network structural capability has a greater positive impact on innovation performance than network relational capability does within an exploration-orientated network. However, network relational capability is more positively associated with innovation performance within an exploitation-orientated network.

Studies from this two-year project (2017-2018) seek to solve three main questions: What changes in engineering teaching conceptions, methods, tools and practices could be generated by reengineering courses using a Big-ideas approach? What changes in key conditions of learning environments have the students perceived in courses that use a Big-ideas approach? What lessons can be derived from the initial studies of REDINGE2’s pilot experiences? Design/methodology/approach: The REDINGE2 project was conceived as a technology-based educational transformation initiative. It is the Faculty of Engineering at UNIANDES’ explicit intention to move engineering teaching from being content-focused to being big-ideas focused. It also wants to migrate from teacher-centered teaching strategies to student- and group-centered approaches. Additionally, this project intends to enrich engineering education ecologies with digital resources by integrating experiential, flexible and collaborative digital learning environments with traditional classroom/workshop/library/home/work learning settings. To promote this organic change, the project implemented a facilitation-from-the side strategy, which redesigned 14 engineering courses: each was given a two-year grant from the Office of the Dean of Engineering to rethink teaching practices and redesign the course. A cybernetic evaluation system was embedded in the life cycle of the transformation process that could support decision-making through each of the project’s stages (Stufflebeam, 1971). Questions of interest in this study are provided with information using triangulation of data at different times during each course’s redesign process. Findings: After a year and half of the two-year REDINGE2 project (2017-2018), it is possible to say the following three research questions are fully solved. Concerning Question #1: What changes in engineering teaching conceptions, methods, tools and practices contribute to reengineering courses when using a Big-ideas approach? Participating teaching staff have demonstrated changes in their teaching conceptions, methods and resources, which can be attributed to their exposure to active-learning strategies supported by digital technologies. In fact, each one has redesigned and pilot tested at least one restructured learning unit for one of their courses according to the proposed Big-ideas approach; in addition, most admit to already having adjusted their teaching practices by changing their mindset regarding learning and how to promote it. Concerning Question #2: What changes in key conditions of learning environments have the students perceived in courses that have been redesigned using a Big-ideas approach? Data collected from students and participating staff members, both before the redesign and throughout this process, have provided teachers and students with feedback concerning perceived changes in learning environments. This has had positive results and provided opportunities for improvement. Concerning Question #3: What lessons can be derived from REDINGE2’s pilot experiences? Lessons from this project are multi-dimensional and there are organizational, pedagogic, technological and cultural considerations. A decalogue of critical success factors was established, which considered the things that must go right to successfully accomplish proposed educational transformations. Research limitations/implications: This study is a good case of educational transformations in engineering teaching. No generalizations should be made, but it shows that similar processes of planned change can be made in tertiary science, math, engineering and technology (SMET) education. Practical implications: The lessons learned from this experience are very valuable for higher education decision-makers who want to innovate by using learning ecologies in their institutions. In addition, theoretical considerations that illuminate the innovation process become very useful to help provide a foundation to similar interventions. Originality/value: A non-conventional approach to integrate digital technologies in higher education teaching is the most significant contribution this experience has made. Its focus has been to transform educational practices with pedagogically sound uses of digital technologies instead of just integrating technologies in current SMET teaching practices. Facilitation-from-the-side and embedded cybernetic evaluation through the transformation process are key ideas that add value to organic change processes.', authkeywords='Active learning strategies | Course redesign with facilitation-from-the-side | Course-redesign | Cybernetic program evaluation | Cybernetic project evaluation | Digital technologies for education | Educational transformations | Engineering education | Group-centered teaching | Idea-based course redesign | Student-centered teaching | Technology-based educational innovations | Technology-based educational transformations', citedby_count=6, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85064014791', doi='10.1108/K-05-2018-0276', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='The experimenting university', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Olaya C.', afid='60052106', affilname='Universidad de Los Andes, Colombia', affiliation_city='Bogota', affiliation_country='Colombia', author_count='1', author_names='Olaya, Camilo', author_ids='36611886300', author_afids='60052106', coverDate='2019-09-19', coverDisplayDate='19 Sep 2019', publicationName='Kybernetes', issn='0368492X', source_id='12981', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='48', issueIdentifier='7', article_number=None, pageRange='1398-1417', description='Purpose: What has been called “the McDonaldization of universities” (another name for top-down and strong corporate managerialism) has gained momentum as a model for governing and managing universities. This trend exacerbates the traditional tension between academic freedom and managerial control – a major challenge for the administration of academic institutions. The ideas of Charles Darwin represent an opportunity for overcoming such a challenge. However, traditional managerial models show inadequate, pre-Darwinian assumptions for devising organizational designs. This paper aims to show not only the opportunities but also the challenges of embracing a Darwinian paradigm for designing social systems. The case of managerialism in universities is an illustrative example. The paper proposes evolutionary guidelines for designing universities capable of maintaining managerial control while warranting academic freedom. Design/methodology/approach: The paper proposes to understand the tension between academic freedom and managerial control in universities as the same tension between freedom and control that Karl Popper identified as successfully handled by evolutionary processes. The paper uses Darwinian theory, understood as a broader theory for complex systems, as a heuristic for designing social systems – universities in this case – able to adapt to changing environmental conditions while handling equilibrium between freedom and control. The methodology articulates the Popperian model of knowledge with the Darwinian scheme proposed by David Ellerman known as “parallel experimentation” for suggesting organizational forms in which university administrators and faculty can interact for generating free innovations in pseudo-controlled organizational arrangements. Findings: A salient characteristic of strong managerialism is its pre-Darwinian understanding of survival and adaptation; such an approach shows important flaws that can lead universities to unfit designs that changing environments can select for elimination. As an alternative, the philosophy behind the ideas of Charles Darwin provides guidelines for designing innovative and adaptive social systems. Evolutionary principles challenge basic tenets of strong managerialism as Darwinian designs discard the possibility of seeing managers as knowledgeable designers that allegedly can avoid mistakes by allocating resources to “one-best” solutions through ex ante exhaustive, top-down control. Instead, a Darwinian model requires considering survival as a matter of adaptability through continuous experimentation of blind trials controlled by ex post selection. The key is to organize universities as experimenting systems that try new and different things all the time and that learn and improve by making mistakes, as an adaptive system. Research limitations/implications: Governing and managing universities require to acknowledge the uniqueness of academic institutions and demand to look for appropriate forms of organization. The proposal of this paper opens possibilities for exploring and implementing action-research initiatives and practical solutions for universities. Studies in management and administration of higher-education institutions must take into account the characteristics of this type of organizations and should consider wider spectrums of possibilities beyond the core ideas of managerialism. Practical implications: University managers face a special challenge for achieving equilibrium between managerial control and academic freedom. Darwinian models of management invite to reconsider several management creeds, for instance, that “errors are bad things” – instead of innovation triggers and learning opportunities or that “one solution must fit all” – instead of considering bottom-up, different and adaptive solutions triggered by local academic units, each facing different environments. Originality/value: Currently, there is no clear picture for governing universities.

The results materialized by experiential actions to reduce negative impacts of disasters are highlighted. Methodology: Engineering learning from earthquakes, based on a long-term seismic culture, became a continuous activity based on field observation, since more than a century. On the other hand, creating earthquake disaster prevention awareness and disaster preparedness can be achieved nowadays by education and active learning addressed to all levels of population, from elder generations to the younger ones, and from usual people to the representatives of authorities. The link between these two approaches is becoming more and more necessary in the context of high local seismicity: investigating the behavior of people, while using emerging technologies (computer-generated imagery, immersive virtual reality etc.), to obtain an active individual attitude. The general concept of awareness and preparedness trends evolved. To deal with earthquake-related situations, people are taught to take measures to prevent severe earthquakes effects, but we must take a step forward to get closer to the system that includes: research knowledge, innovation, GIS and specialized software, and more importantly, the access to all of these, through public and private involvement. Conclusions: The Vrancea seismic zone of Romania, as a natural laboratory, involves us with knowledge and individual perception and attitudes and we have time for improved engineering codes, exploring and experiencing some new learning modalities, refining new policies and regulations from this field, new scenarios for implementation of disaster measures.', authkeywords=None, citedby_count=1, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85072185900', doi='10.1016/j.joule.2019.07.018', pii='S2542435119303629', pubmed_id=None, title='Meeting U.S. Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Targets', subtype='no', subtypeDescription='Note', creator='Whiston M.M.', afid='60104842;60027950;60012708', affilname='College of Engineering;Carnegie Mellon University;Stanford University', affiliation_city='Pittsburgh;Pittsburgh;Stanford', affiliation_country='United States;United States;United States', author_count='6', author_names='Whiston, Michael M.;Azevedo, Inês M.L.;Litster, Shawn;Samaras, Constantine;Whitefoot, Kate S.;Whitacre, Jay F.', author_ids='56554189000;57211166980;57200995021;24341721700;36683750600;7003310456', author_afids='60104842;60012708;60104842;60104842;60104842;60104842-60027950', coverDate='2019-09-18', coverDisplayDate='18 September 2019', publicationName='Joule', issn=None, source_id='21100834904', eIssn='25424351', aggregationType='Journal', volume='3', issueIdentifier='9', article_number=None, pageRange='2060-2065', description=\"Michael M.

One of the most promising solutions, known as \"One Side Assembly\", aims to perform the whole assembly sequence from one side of the structure (drilling, temporary fastener installation and removal, blind fastener installation, assembly control) and with a high level of integrated automation. Investments in robotic equipment, automation engineering and innovation are very active and automation capabilities have already increased a lot in the aerospace industry. As an example, drilling operations for large dimensions airframe are clearly moving from manual to automated. However, despite more and more clever and sophisticated robotics, the use of historical fasteners with two side installation method remains a strong limitation to innovative automated assembly sequences. A blind fastener which can provide the same mechanical characteristics than current structural fasteners, while providing automation friendly features and meeting cost objectives is a real \"must have\" for assembly process efficiency improvements. It is also full of challenges for aerospace fasteners industry.

The construction of their artificial mimics, however, remains one of the most formidable challenges facing synthetic chemists. Here, we report a hierarchical diamondoid superstructure—namely, a supramolecular diamond—that is constructed from the multiple-level self-assembly of a highly symmetrical salt, hexakis[(4,4′-bipyridin-1-ium)methylene]benzene hexafluorophosphate. The uniform octahedral single crystals, with 96 cationic organic fragments and 96 counteranions in a unit cell, can be prepared quantitatively in a controllable one-step procedure within seconds at ambient conditions. The sizes of the resulting samples are modulated from 280 nm to 660 μm. The mechanism of the self-assembly was elucidated at the atomic level. As proof of its intrinsically cationic superstructure with mobile anions, the three-dimensional nanoporous framework can exchange efficiently with metal oxoanions. This research shows that precisely tunable hierarchical assemblies can translate charged molecules into complicated architectures. Hierarchical self-assembly is a ubiquitous process for building sophisticated supramolecular architectures in nature. Mimicking the process and unraveling the mechanisms involved in high-precision self-assembly, however, remain a formidable challenge. Here, we present a unique strategy for constructing a hierarchical diamondoid superstructure—namely, a supramolecular diamond—that is constructed quantitatively from preorganized building blocks. The complementary interactions direct the repulsive cationic fragments to organize into a highly ordered 3D supramolecular framework. The sizes of the supramolecular diamond can be modulated from 280 nm to 660 μm. As proof of concept, the intrinsically cationic superstructure can exchange metal oxoanions with excellent efficiencies. This research shows the art and charm of hierarchical assembly and is a significant step toward a better fundamental understanding of how to produce precisely tunable assemblies. Stoddart and colleagues present a unique concept for constructing a nanoporous diamondoid superstructure—namely, a supramolecular diamond—from the hierarchical self-assembly of preorganized hexa-charged molecules. The octahedral single crystals of supramolecular diamond with controllable sizes can be prepared quantitatively within seconds under ambient conditions.

Examining these obvious linkages, the paper also addresses how these firms address their entrepreneurial, engineering and administrative problem domains in relationship with the firm’s strategic archetype. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 503 firms across the US. Measures previously validated were used to collect information related to the strategic archetype as well as the three problem domains. Multiple discriminant and regression analyses were used to test the hypotheses. Findings: Most of the hypotheses relating the entrepreneurial (exploration and exploitation), engineering (radical and incremental innovation) and administrative problem (adaptation and alignment) to the four strategic archetypes (defender, prospector, analyzer and reactor) were supported. Additionally, the authors found that the firms that had the closest alignment along the three problem domains outperformed the other firms. Originality/value: Although the Miles and Snow typology has received considerable research attention, the obvious links with more contemporary research on organizational ambidexterity has been neglected.

Understanding the factors that influence the AEC’s adoption of BIM will benefit the research and practice of BIM. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: This study provides empirical evidence for the accumulated knowledge of BIM adoption by examining the context of Chinese construction industry. Based on the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework in the innovation diffusion literature, the authors develop a research model that integrates the critical success factors related to the technology of BIM, the construction company and the environment in Chinese construction industry. The authors collected two different data sets from engineering consulting firms and construction firms in China, and conducted rigorous analyses using a sophisticated statistical approach. Findings: The authors found that the relative advantage of BIM was a major factor that enabled BIM adoption, while the complexity of BIM was an inhibiter. In addition, management support was also a significant antecedent of BIM adoption. However, organizational readiness was significant for engineering consulting firms but not for construction firms. Surprisingly, the authors did not find consistent significant impacts of any environmental factors. Last, younger firms were more likely to adopt BIM.

Design thinking has been one of these sought-after innovation approaches in recent years. Design thinking has produced remarkable results in creative firms such as design consultancies, but its implementation in large, established firms has proven to be far more challenging, especially if a strong company culture contradicts the philosophies underlying design thinking. One possible answer to this challenge lies in adapting an innovation approach such as design thinking to its new environment so it can truly take hold.

These contradictory suggestions place managers in a dilemma: Should they follow a top-down or bottom-up approach? In this research, we build on an ethnographic approach to study how an innovative engineering company (MachineryCorp) managed the contradiction when the firm developed an InfoSec policy. Drawing on the dialectical theory of organisations as a lens, the findings suggest the InfoSec policy development is a recurrent process consisting of three phases: (1) drawing interpretations of InfoSec requirements from best practices (deductive adoption) and (2) constructing possibilities for local implementation (inductive adjustment) (3) that engender tensions between best practices and local contingencies facilitating innovative local resolutions (synthetic innovation). We call this process abductive innovation.

Education has an essential role in this process, as it is responsible for the establishment of the necessary knowledge and skills in students today, who will be the key driver in future development. ICT has been widely introduced to school programs for students to learn, but the meaningful integration of technology into classrooms is not strongly evident. Until recently, the use of these technologies in education practice is not explored in details. Many studies point out that teachers are the key determinant to the effective use of ICT in teaching practice. However, the issue of how students perceive the efforts of teachers in this direction have to be further explored. There are a lot of related studies worldwide, but very few empirical research has been done to investigate this issue in the context of Bulgaria. The authors make a scientific study on the role and impact of ICT to comprehensively demonstrate the effects of technology tools on the learning process. For that purpose, a survey that applies multiple case study methodology is performed, where both teachers and school students were the units of sampling used. The goal is to explore their views concerning the impact and importance of technology in education. The presented research formalizes and assesses the main aspects that refer to the use of new technologies in the education process. The current paper focuses on several issues concerning the application of ICT resources and tools in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and other subjects. The results point to the importance of providing appropriate conditions for effective teaching, so teachers can employ a wide range of technology resources to support many different pedagogical strategies to enhance the comprehension of students.', authkeywords='Adoption of ICT | Bulgarian schools | Classroom practice | ICT resources | Views of teachers', citedby_count=2, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='MES', fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='Ministry of Education and Science'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85078512771', doi='10.1109/IC2IE47452.2019.8940897', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Analysis of Information Technology Support for Business Models Based on the Blue Ocean Strategy in Indonesian Organization', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Aditya W.', afid='60069377', affilname='Universitas Indonesia', affiliation_city='Depok', affiliation_country='Indonesia', author_count='9', author_names='Aditya, Wahyu;Ikhwan, Fanni Saeful;Pradnyana, Nym Adi;Sherly, Maria;Prasetyo, Budi;Nazri, Muhammad;Shihab, Muhammad Rifki;Ranti, Benny;Hidayanto, Achmad Nizar', author_ids='57215286266;57195415448;57215284417;57215282345;57193735900;57211276568;56363073800;57191851850;57205093001', author_afids='60069377;60069377;60069377;60069377;60069377;60069377;60069377;60069377;60069377', coverDate='2019-09-01', coverDisplayDate='September 2019', publicationName='Proceedings - 2019 2nd International Conference of Computer and Informatics Engineering: Artificial Intelligence Roles in Industrial Revolution 4.0, IC2IE 2019', issn=None, source_id='21100955699', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number='8940897', pageRange='153-158', description=\"Industrial competition in Indonesia is increasingly tight, and many organizations are competing and attempt to win the competition, it is called Red Ocean competition.

The present research investigated whether and how a small dose of DT, e.g. a workshop, can facilitate requirements elicitation of an organization's business process. The paper presents an exploratory case study of a DT workshop on procurement process requirements conducted in a large technological organization specializing in the de-velopment of hardware and software systems. The study revealed that applying the DT method and tools promoted the discussion among the various stakeholders and allowed different voices to be heard, leading to new requirements regarding the business process, from both human and technical perspectives.

To realize this type of innovation, a meta‐analysis of the body of research is necessary to reveal demand‐matching concepts. However, both the data deluge and the narrow time constraints for innovation make it impossible to perform such reviews manually. Thus, this paper proposes a specifically adapted “Potential Technologies Review” approach focusing on automated text mining and information retrieval techniques. The novel framework combines features from both systematic and scoping reviews. It aims at high coverage and reproducibility while mapping technologies—even with a fuzzy initial scope. To achieve these goals for search and triage, a set of closely interrelated methods has been developed: (a) automated query optimization, (b) screening prioritization, and (c) recall estimation. To determine appropriate parameters, a variety of published literature corpora were used and compared with an evaluation on a real‐world dataset. Our results show that it is feasible to automate the identification of relevant works using this newly introduced framework. It achieved a workload reduction of up to 91% “Work‐saved‐over Sampling (WSS)” with a 76% overall recall compared with manually screening search results. Reducing the workload is a prerequisite for a rapid Potential Technologies Review when conducting demand‐pull innovations.

Recently, progress has been made in data-efficient learning of generative grasp models that transfer well to novel objects. These generative grasp models are learned from demonstration (LfD). One weakness is that, as this paper shall show, grasp transfer under challenging single-view conditions is unreliable. Second, the number of generative model elements increases linearly in the number of training examples. This, in turn, limits the potential of these generative models for generalization and continual improvement. In this paper, it is shown how to address these problems. Several technical contributions are made: (i) a view-based model of a grasp; (ii) a method for combining and compressing multiple grasp models; (iii) a new way of evaluating contacts that is used both to generate and to score grasps. Together, these improve grasp performance and reduce the number of models learned. These advances, in turn, allow the introduction of autonomous training, in which the robot learns from self-generated grasps. Evaluation on a challenging test set shows that, with innovations (i)–(iii) deployed, grasp transfer success increases from 55.1% to 81.6%. By adding autonomous training this rises to 87.8%. These differences are statistically significant.

This acceptance is thus an essential factor for the growth of SDPB services. In this context, the travel behavior of young people is particularly interesting, as its development will continually demonstrate future mobility behavior trends. However, little research has been conducted regarding the best methods for motivating young people to accept SDPBs as a viable mode of travel. To address this topic, we first conducted a literature review, identifying factors that potentially influence SDPB acceptance. Subsequently, we developed a comprehensive research model based on the life-oriented approach and the technology acceptance model. This conceptualization was validated by a survey of 268 SDPB riders in real-world traffic. The results reveal several novel factors influencing the acceptance of SDPBs, in particular regarding differences in age.

These exciting times in biomedical innovation require the development of novel technologies to facilitate the sophisticated, multifaceted, high-paced workflows necessary to support modern large molecule drug discovery. A high-level aspiration is a true integration of “lab-on-a-chip” methods that vastly miniaturize cellulmical experiments could transform the speed, cost, and success of multiple workstreams in biologics development. Several microscale bioprocess technologies have been established that incrementally address these needs, yet each is inflexibly designed for a very specific process thus limiting an integrated holistic application. A more fully integrated nanoscale approach that incorporates manipulation, culture, analytics, and traceable digital record keeping of thousands of single cells in a relevant nanoenvironment would be a transformative technology capable of keeping pace with today's rapid and complex drug discovery demands. The recent advent of optical manipulation of cells using light-induced electrokinetics with micro- and nanoscale cell culture is poised to revolutionize both fundamental and applied biological research. In this review, we summarize the current state of the art for optical manipulation techniques and discuss emerging biological applications of this technology. In particular, we focus on promising prospects for drug discovery workflows, including antibody discovery, bioassay development, antibody engineering, and cell line development, which are enabled by the automation and industrialization of an integrated optoelectronic single-cell manipulation and culture platform. Continued development of such platforms will be well positioned to overcome many of the challenges currently associated with fragmented, low-throughput bioprocess workflows in biopharma and life science research.\", authkeywords='advanced biotechnology | bioassay development | digital cell biology | drug discovery | nanoscale cell culture | optical manipulation techniques | single cell technology', citedby_count=24, openaccess=1, freetoread='repositoryvor', freetoreadLabel='Green', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85067682001', doi='10.1016/j.tracli.2019.06.001', pii='S1246782019300643', pubmed_id='31253495', title='Psychosocial and cognitive engineering contributions to blood transfusion', subtype='sh', subtypeDescription='Short Survey', creator='Beurel A.', afid='60046714;60030657', affilname='Etablissement Français du Sang;Université Rennes 2', affiliation_city='Saint-Denis-la-Plaine;Rennes', affiliation_country='France;France', author_count='4', author_names='Beurel, A.;Terrade, F.;Lebaudy, J.

In 1956, the first links between transfusion medicine and social psychology were formed, with the study of underlying motivations to blood donation behavior. Sixty years later, the number of “fundamental” and “applied” research has widely increased, and we now have a theoretical understanding of blood donation engagement's levers, as well as experimental demonstrations of methods to activate these levers. Thus, the literature offers several strategies experimentally verified to improve the recruitment and retaining of blood donors. These methods can go from specific speeches when soliciting donors, to changes in the blood donation environment, etc. They aim either at impacting the donation experience, at obtaining a change in the donor's behavior, or at changing the determinants of blood donation. Yet, it is clear that the knowledge from the research in social psychology is not really deployed on the field by the organizations that could benefit from it. In this article, we will try to develop the difficulty regarding the application of fundamental and experimental knowledge, and to underline the implications for the blood transfusion establishments.

The production mode of the enterprises has been changed from the traditional inventory mode to the customization manufacturing mode driven by the customer orders. Furthermore, the simple customization model cannot meet the industrial needs in the open and networked era. Therefore, there is a lack of an innovative manufacturing mode that not only meets the individual needs of customers, but also adapts to today's open and networked environment. In this paper, a new customization model was proposed, which is a continuously improved customization model called CPMS (Customer Platform-connection Manufactory to Service).

Through analysing the development of industry, combining with the existing analysis and projects we involved in, and the method of system engineering analysis, an overall framework of CPMS model is derived. At last, a case study for implementation of CPMS in the car industry has been given. Under this model, enterprises can improve the flexible production capacity of production line, reduce the production cost, reduce inventory, improve the modular configuration of products, and etc. Moreover, it can provide some reference value for enterprises to plan, design, implement and apply a new customization production model that conform to the requirements of the new era of open and networked.\", authkeywords='Customer to business (C2B) | Manufacturing system | Mass customization | Model innovation | Personalized customization | Product service system (PSS)', citedby_count=16, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='NSFC', fund_no='2017-GYHLW-01009', fund_sponsor='National Natural Science Foundation of China'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85066104083', doi='10.1016/j.engstruct.2019.05.051', pii='S0141029619304304', pubmed_id=None, title='Passive seismic unseating prevention strategies implemented in highway bridges: A state-of-the-art review', subtype='re', subtypeDescription='Review', creator='Xiang N.', afid='60024751;60012967', affilname='Nagoya Institute of Technology;University of British Columbia Okanagan', affiliation_city='Nagoya;Kelowna', affiliation_country='Japan;Canada', author_count='4', author_names='Xiang, Nailiang;Goto, Yoshiaki;Obata, Makoto;Alam, M.

For this reason, the objective of this research is to quantify the relevance of the selected design method when generating concepts in the early stages of design. To compare the performance of structured and intuitive methods to generate ideas, a two-stage experiment was applied in two contexts in which were evaluated novelty, variety, quality and quantity. First, participants were asked to solve a problem using a recently taught method. The aim was to obtain insights about the influence of each method. Second, all participants were asked to solve a new problem after being taught four chosen methods, the goal being to obtain insights about the team’s circumstances. In general, the best results were obtained with structured methods, which simultaneously were also the least preferred by students, probably due to the ease of implementation associated with the alternative type of methods; namely, intuitive. Additionally, the study investigated other significant effects, such as the length of time of the experiments and the timing of each stage, as well as the effects of the particular context in which the experiment occurred. Considering the two types of methods, for example, an organization focused on structured methods could benefit from using those methods periodically, increasing its “tool dexterity” ability, while an organization focused on intuitive methods could emphasize the background of the users, namely the “user capacities”. Since those trends—and others—were similar for both problems in both contexts, it is natural to ask which changes could modify these tendencies. Changing the problem’s complexity and reaching to a more diverse universe of participants could be a good step towards having more confidence in the deduction of general design principles to generate ideas for solving real world challenges.', authkeywords='Design methods | Educational innovation | KJ technique | SCAMPER | TRIZ', citedby_count=9, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85065718296', doi='10.1016/j.compind.2019.04.016', pii='S016636151830366X', pubmed_id=None, title='A comparison of fog and cloud computing cyber-physical interfaces for Industry 4.0 real-time embedded machine learning engineering applications', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator=\"O'Donovan P.\", afid='60025160', affilname='University College Cork', affiliation_city='Cork', affiliation_country='Ireland', author_count='4', author_names=\"O'Donovan, Peter;Gallagher, Colm;Leahy, Kevin;O'Sullivan, Dominic T.J.\", author_ids='55998975800;57192813515;56814625200;57205565367', author_afids='60025160;60025160;60025160;60025160', coverDate='2019-09-01', coverDisplayDate='September 2019', publicationName='Computers in Industry', issn='01663615', source_id='19080', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='110', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='12-35', description=\"Industrial cyber-physical systems are the primary enabling technology for Industry 4.0, which combine legacy industrial and control engineering, with emerging technology paradigms (e.g. big data, internet-of-things, artificial intelligence, and machine learning), to derive self-aware and self-configuring factories capable of delivering major production innovations.

Results have been inconclusive whether or not the use of state-of-the-art simulations with traditional teaching methods improve the academic performance of students. From the point of view of the authors, some of these negative results could be because teachers do not receive any guidance on how to incorporate the use of simulations in their teaching strategy. This paper reports the evaluation of a platform to simulate industrial robots based on the MATLAB™ and Simulink™ environment. The platform was used by 3 teachers of undergraduate robotics courses. Each teacher was trained how to use the platform. For teachers of groups A and B, in addition to this training, they also received guidance on how to use the platform in their classes, while the teacher of group C freely decided on his own how to use the platform in his classes. In each group, the teacher covered the same topics about forward kinematics, and the same exercises were given to the students to solve during the practical sessions. As a result, students in groups A and B attained better academic performance compared to students of group C. This fact shows that it is necessary to train the professors not only in the use of the platform but also in the incorporation of this technology into their courses.', authkeywords='3D simulations | Educational innovation | Educational platforms | Teaching strategy | Tools for teaching', citedby_count=3, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='ITESM', fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85061612708', doi='10.1007/s12008-019-00557-8', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Active learning in engineering education.

It consists of letting students be the main actors of the learning process by performing meaningful activities and critically thinking about what they are doing. In this research, a review of Active Learning is performed. The focus is on presenting concepts and practices central to Active Learning that leading universities are deploying, universities such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology, North Carolina State University and Aalborg University.

The need is to identify the research status and explore where this new set of technologies effectively can be deployed. Methods: Research articles till September 2018 are searched from Scopus by keywords as “4D printing” and “4D printing\"\"medical\" and undertaken a bibliometric analysis of the identified papers. Further relevant papers were studied for application in the medical field. Results: Search through Scopus identified 171 research articles on 4D printing and 13 research articles on 4D printing in the medical field. This study states that 4D printing is the latest technology that creates innovation and addresses complex medical problems. Paper briefly describes the 4D printing and details its difference from 3D printing technology. We have identified five steps to be used to create a medical model by using this technology and its prospective implementation for medical applications. Identified that research is carried out on 4D printing, but decidedly less publication is available in the medical field reporting the application of this technology. Finally, we have identified nine significant applications of 4D printing in the medical field. The main limitation is that it requires extensive investment & support for transformation. Conclusions: 4D printing is to provide benefits to medical practitioners especially in the areas not covered by 3D printing technologies. 4D printing helps to create a 3D physical object by adding smart material layer by layer through computer-operated computer-aided design (CAD) data. It adds a dimension of transformation over time where printed products are sensitive to parameters like temperature, humidity, time etc. This technology can provide extensive support in the medical field, especially with better and smart medical implants, tools and devices.

This article explores the microfoundations of energy consumers' and prosumers’ interest to participate in co-creation activities with energy industry actors. Using survey data from five European countries and by applying variance-based structural equation modeling, we find that rewards and personal characteristics influence the interest to engage in co-creation activities.

This paper considers the mining industry’s need for DT. Then, it presents a three-part review of the foundational components of the DT process–ubiquitous data, connectivity, and decision making. Finally, it provides a discussion on the future of DT in mining as well as a research direction, which identifies the need of academia to provide support for mining companies in the form of both research and the education of digitally literate, dynamically capable mining engineers into the coming decades.', authkeywords='Analytics | Big data | Data science | Innovation | Operations technology', citedby_count=63, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85064827278', doi='10.1007/s10664-019-09711-y', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Characterizing industry-academia collaborations in software engineering: evidence from 101 projects', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Garousi V.', afid='60111756;60090134;60068856;60020475;60016636;60012954;60009999;60004156;60002306;60000021', affilname='Kristiania University College;ABB Group, USA;Tartu Ülikool;Universidade do Minho;Blekinge Tekniska Högskola;Oulun Yliopisto;Universität Innsbruck;Wageningen University & Research;University of Calgary;Atatürk Üniversitesi', affiliation_city='Oslo;Cary;Tartu;Braga;Karlskrona;Oulu;Innsbruck;Wageningen;Calgary;Erzurum', affiliation_country='Norway;United States;Estonia;Portugal;Sweden;Finland;Austria;Netherlands;Canada;Turkey', author_count='9', author_names='Garousi, Vahid;Pfahl, Dietmar;Fernandes, João M.;Felderer, Michael;Mäntylä, Mika V.;Shepherd, David;Arcuri, Andrea;Coşkunçay, Ahmet;Tekinerdogan, Bedir', author_ids='13408954200;6603033193;7201540270;24832720900;7006843663;7201684174;23097099900;56426408500;15761578600', author_afids='60004156;60068856-60002306;60020475;60009999-60016636;60012954;60090134;60111756;60000021;60004156', coverDate='2019-08-15', coverDisplayDate='15 August 2019', publicationName='Empirical Software Engineering', issn='13823256', source_id='18650', eIssn='15737616', aggregationType='Journal', volume='24', issueIdentifier='4', article_number=None, pageRange='2540-2602', description='Research collaboration between industry and academia supports improvement and innovation in industry and helps ensure the industrial relevance of academic research. However, many researchers and practitioners in the community believe that the level of joint industry-academia collaboration (IAC) projects in Software Engineering (SE) research is relatively low, creating a barrier between research and practice. The goal of the empirical study reported in this paper is to explore and characterize the state of IAC with respect to industrial needs, developed solutions, impacts of the projects and also a set of challenges, patterns and anti-patterns identified by a recent Systematic Literature Review (SLR) study. To address the above goal, we conducted an opinion survey among researchers and practitioners with respect to their experience in IAC. Our dataset includes 101 data points from IAC projects conducted in 21 different countries. Our findings include: (1) the most popular topics of the IAC projects, in the dataset, are: software testing, quality, process, and project managements; (2) over 90% of IAC projects result in at least one publication; (3) almost 50% of IACs are initiated by industry, busting the myth that industry tends to avoid IACs; and (4) 61% of the IAC projects report having a positive impact on their industrial context, while 31% report no noticeable impacts or were “not sure”. To improve this situation, we present evidence-based recommendations to increase the success of IAC projects, such as the importance of testing pilot solutions before using them in industry. This study aims to contribute to the body of evidence in the area of IAC, and benefit researchers and practitioners.

Yet, single-layered two-dimensional (2D) perovskites are strongly limited by trap-assisted recombination and suffer from low luminescence yields, hampering their application in electroluminescence devices. Here, we use synthetic and defect engineering strategies to overcome such issues. We employ metallic doping (Mn2+ and Eu3+) to introduce luminescent impurities in the 2D perovskite NMA2PbX4 (NMA = 1-naphtylmethylammonium). By means of temperature-dependent and time-resolved spectroscopy, we demonstrate efficient energy transfer to Mn2+ centers. This avoids funneling of photo-excited species in inefficient recombination channels, enhancing photoluminescence and giving a quantum yield surpassing 20% in doped films. Eventually, we embody Mn-doped NMA2PbBr4 in a light-emitting diode architecture and show electroluminescence from the Mn2+ 4T1 → 6A1 transition. This proof-of-concept demonstration shows the potential of doping in layered perovskites and prompts the study of a wider range of host-guest structures. Metal halide perovskites have emerged for light-emitting applications, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs). While intensive research has focused on three-dimensional (3D) perovskites, layered perovskites are also gaining interest for their peculiar light-emitting properties. The higher exciton binding energy of low-dimensional perovskites is considered beneficial to improve the radiative recombination efficiency. However, the luminescence yield of single-layered two-dimensional (2D) perovskites is severely lowered by trap-assisted recombination. By including Mn2+ and Eu3+ in a 2D perovskite, we show that metallic doping can be exploited to enhance and tune its luminescence. Efficient energy transfer from the perovskite to the dopant is achieved, provided that a suitable energy level alignment of the host-guest system is realized. We show that such a mechanism can be exploited to tune the material's electroluminescence in a proof-of-concept LED based on a Mn-doped 2D perovskite. Cortecchia et al. report the use of metallic dopants to overcome the detrimental trap-mediated non-radiative recombination processes, lowering the luminescence yield in two-dimensional perovskites. This results in tuning and enhancement of the perovskite's luminescence properties. In particular, efficient energy transfer and high luminescence yield are obtained with manganese doping. This strategy is shown to be suitable for application in light-emitting diodes.\", authkeywords='1-naphtylmethylammonium | 2D perovskite | doping | energy transfer | europium | LED | manganese | SDG7: Affordable and clean energy | SDG9: Industry, innovation, and infrastructure | triplet', citedby_count=83, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherhybridgold', freetoreadLabel='Hybrid Gold', fund_acr='H2020', fund_no='771528', fund_sponsor='Horizon 2020 Framework Programme'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85058964924', doi='10.1108/IJESM-10-2018-0009', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Microreactors: ‘micro’managing our macro energy demands', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Rossi O.', afid='60279592;60033154', affilname='North Carolina A&T College of Engineering;Concordia University', affiliation_city='Greensboro;Montreal', affiliation_country='United States;Canada', author_count='2', author_names='Rossi, Olivia;Chandrasekaran, Arvind', author_ids='57205186302;14033867100', author_afids='60033154;60279592', coverDate='2019-08-08', coverDisplayDate='8 Aug 2019', publicationName='International Journal of Energy Sector Management', issn='17506220', source_id='6400153116', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='13', issueIdentifier='3', article_number=None, pageRange='590-596', description='Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to answer this question by discussing the practicality of implementing microreactor technology towards large-scale renewable energy generation, as well as provide an incentive for future researchers to utilize microreactors as a useful alternative tool for green energy production.

On the one hand, permeability in organizations engenders fluidity which increases organizational capabilities through adaptability, diversity, and speed. On the other hand, organizations continuously redefine and reinvent their boundaries to remain stable and to exhibit self-identity. These two competing demands of organizations to simultaneously become fluid as well as stable are evident in modern shared workplaces where organizations share offices with other organizations and professionals. The purpose of this research is to analyze how permeability in shared office spaces influence the internal work structures and processes of members' organizations who have relatively fixed memberships, stable structures, and steep hierarchies. We collected qualitative data based on an inductive research methodology from the providers and users of a coworking-space. Our study concludes that participational autonomy, spatial and virtual connectivity and interrelational heterogeneity determine the level of permeability in a coworking-space. The space level permeability influences the work structures and task processes of members' organizations. Changeability in organizational processes engenders structural differentiation, decentralization, and ad-hoc work processes, which provide autonomy to the organizational employees or independent users to define their work structures, task processes, and work routines. Organizations though maintain their rudimentary structures and permeable boundaries through self-regulatory resources. In this way, permeability enables organizations to leverage the differentiated capabilities of members within and outside of the space and facilitates knowledge exchange across boundaries and hierarchical levels that lead to innovative outcomes.\", authkeywords=None, citedby_count=3, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85075630668', doi='10.23919/PICMET.2019.8893890', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Adapting market uncertainty in digital innovation based on adaptive capability configurations', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Yang W.', afid='60013614', affilname='Hangzhou Dianzi University', affiliation_city='Hangzhou', affiliation_country='China', author_count='4', author_names='Yang, Wei;Zhou, Qing;Fang, Gang;Chen, Chouyong', author_ids='57001346800;55722126300;56417114200;14059644600', author_afids='60013614;60013614;60013614;60013614', coverDate='2019-08-01', coverDisplayDate='August 2019', publicationName='PICMET 2019 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Technology Management in the World of Intelligent Systems, Proceedings', issn=None, source_id='21100936625', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number='8893890', pageRange=None, description='Digital innovation is crucial for companies surviving and growing in a digital world.

Although this concept has been established as an important antecedent of organizational innovation and performance, it is still unclear how organizational best strive for ambidexterity and even how this concept be best understood.

Our paper proposes a research agenda that will: specify the size of the problem of hanging by ceiling fan (Stage 1: Surveillance), use standard engineering product development processes to modify ceiling fans for reducing their lethal capacity (Stage 2: Design Testing and Redevelopment), and examine the resulting beta-and release-build fans for safety and potential to reduce suicide in community samples (Stage 3: Evaluation).', authkeywords='Ceiling fan | Engineering innovation | Hanging | Means restriction | Suicide', citedby_count=4, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85068251992', doi='10.1016/j.addr.2019.06.004', pii='S0169409X19300675', pubmed_id='31228483', title='Enabling biodegradable functional biomaterials for the management of neurological disorders', subtype='re', subtypeDescription='Review', creator='Shan D.', afid='60147936', affilname='Penn State College of Engineering', affiliation_city='University Park', affiliation_country='United States', author_count='3', author_names='Shan, Dingying;Ma, Chuying;Yang, Jian', author_ids='57021040300;57192683649;8129945500', author_afids='60147936;60147936;60147936', coverDate='2019-08-01', coverDisplayDate='August 2019', publicationName='Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews', issn='0169409X', source_id='19409', eIssn='18728294', aggregationType='Journal', volume='148', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='219-238', description='An increasing number of patients are being diagnosed with neurological diseases, but are rarely cured because of the lack of curative therapeutic approaches.

Regenerative braking, also termed electrical energy regeneration, represents a promising solution to the aforementioned shortcomings. Regenerative braking converts the otherwise dissipated mechanical energy during locomotion into electrical energy for recharging the onboard batteries, while simultaneously providing negative mechanical work for controlled system deceleration. This paper reviewed the electromechanical design and optimization of lower-limb biomechatronic devices with electrical energy regeneration. The technical review starts by examining human walking biomechanics (i.e., mechanical work, power, and torque about the hip, knee, and ankle joints) and proposes general design principles for regenerative braking prostheses and exoskeletons. Analogous to electric and hybrid electric vehicle powertrains, there are numerous mechatronic design components that could be optimized to maximize electrical energy regeneration, including the mechanical power transmission, electromagnetic machine, electrical drive, device mass and moment of inertia, and energy storage devices. Design optimization of these system components is individually discussed while referencing the latest advancements in robotics and automotive engineering. The technical review demonstrated that existing systems (1) are limited to level-ground walking applications and (2) have maximum energy regeneration efficiencies between 30% and 37%. Accordingly, potential future directions for research and innovation include (1) regenerative braking during dynamic movements like sitting down and slope and staircase descent and (2) utilizing high-torque-density electromagnetic machines and low-impedance mechanical power transmissions to maximize energy regeneration efficiencies.', authkeywords='actuators and transmissions | medical robotics | multibody dynamics and exoskeletons | prosthetics | wearable robots', citedby_count=36, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='NSERC', fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital Foundation'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85067240096', doi='10.1016/j.technovation.2019.05.005', pii='S0166497217307642', pubmed_id=None, title='The fit between firms’ open innovation and business model for new product development speed: A contingent perspective', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Zhu X.', afid='60116229;60019118;60018308;60002836', affilname=\"City University of Hong Kong, College of Business;University of Science and Technology of China;Xi'an Jiaotong University;Hefei University of Technology\", affiliation_city=\"Hong Kong;Hefei;Xi'an;Hefei\", affiliation_country='Hong Kong;China;China;China', author_count='4', author_names='Zhu, Xiaoxuan;Xiao, Zhenxin;Dong, Maggie Chuoyan;Gu, J.', author_ids='57204547053;57207848186;24597206500;23984570700', author_afids='60002836;60018308;60116229;60019118', coverDate='2019-08-01', coverDisplayDate='August - September 2019', publicationName='Technovation', issn='01664972', source_id='14726', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='86-87', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='75-85', description='Recent studies suggest that the effectiveness of open innovation (OI) can significantly differ among firms.

Determining the most suitable management approach in a specific context requires a better understanding of the full suite of economic values the population holds for coastal assets, including non-market values. In this study, we characterise New South Wales residents' willingness to pay to maintain sandy beaches (width and length) in the face of coastal erosion along the Australian state's nearly 2200 km coastline. The measurement instrument is a stated preference referendum task administered state-wide to a sample of 2014 respondents, with the payment mechanism defined as a purpose-specific incremental levy of a fixed amount over a set period of years. We use an innovative application of a Latent Class Binary Logit model to deal with “Yea-sayers” and “Nay-sayers”, as well as revealing the latent heterogeneity among sample members. We find that 65% of the population would be willing to pay some amount of levy, dependent on the policy setting. In most cases, there is no effect of degree of beach deterioration – characterised as loss of width and/or length of sandy beaches of between 5% and 100% - on respondents' willingness to pay for a management levy. This suggests that respondents who agreed to pay a management levy were motivated to preserve sandy beaches in their current state irrespective of the severity of sand loss likely to occur as a result of coastal erosion. Willingness to pay also varies according to beach type (amongst Iconic, Main, Bay and Surf beaches) – a finding that can assist with spatial prioritisation of coastal management. Not recognizing the presence of nay-sayers in the data or recognizing them but eliminating them from the estimation will result in biased WTP results and, consequently, biased policy propositions by coastal managers.\", authkeywords='Beach erosion | Choice modelling | Coastal management | Levy | Protest voting | Referendum', citedby_count=23, openaccess=0, freetoread='repositoryam', freetoreadLabel='Green', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85065829453', doi='10.1016/j.technovation.2019.05.003', pii='S0166497218300890', pubmed_id=None, title='Scientific effects of Triple Helix interactions among research institutes, industries and universities', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Zhang Y.', afid='60273016;60175816;60073738;60027363', affilname='Institutes of Science and Development;Oxford Social Sciences Division;Guangdong Ocean University;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences', affiliation_city='Beijing;Oxford;Zhanjiang;Beijing', affiliation_country='China;United Kingdom;China;China', author_count='3', author_names='Zhang, Yi;Chen, Kaihua;Fu, Xiaolan', author_ids='57189996047;56160281900;34871994400', author_afids='60073738;60273016-60027363-60175816;60175816', coverDate='2019-08-01', coverDisplayDate='August - September 2019', publicationName='Technovation', issn='01664972', source_id='14726', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='86-87', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='33-47', description=\"The Triple Helix (TH) interactions among innovation organizations have become increasingly important for national science and technology development.

First, based on the system innovation literature, we identify the critical components that characterize the innovative practices. We then examine the contextualization process of EPC in Shanghai using this characterization. Finally, we identify and compare some innovative elements that emerged during the contextualization with those in the original contexts from which Shanghai learned. We argue that post experiment adoption and contextualization requires mobilization and realignments of actors, resources, and institutional arrangements within the process of learning, which involves much more than simple duplication and often with distinctive outcomes, thus in many ways is an innovation in itself. Innovation in post experiment contextualization is supported by various “horizontal linkages” with the original experiment, which include information/knowledge transfer and learning via actor interactions across experiments, but the focus of learning shifts from external (i.e. from the original context)to internal (i.e. within the new context)during the contextualization process.

The finding is that commitment to product innovation increases with competition at a modest level of competitive pressure, especially if foreign entry and import are considered. However, this result is mostly driven by technologically weak plants, which innovate less than leaders and followers at a low level of competition, but are encouraged to innovate more by a modest increase of competitive pressure, when theoretically predicted optimal behavior would be to refrain from innovation. When competition is strong, plants in all technology groups give up the innovation race.

However, unlike almost every other STEM discipline, the overall ratio of females is higher in many forensic science disciplines. For our sector, rather than having difficulty in attracting females, the bigger issue is how we retain and promote female talent. This complex issue is exacerbated by: gender pay gaps; family role expectations; lack of visible role models or mentors; discrimination and harassment; and bias during recruitment and promotion practices. We discuss barriers relevant for women in the forensic industry and offer potential solutions. These include flexible work arrangements, sponsorship programmes, and fostering and practising an inclusive workplace culture.

We used the publication output from 2004 to 2013 and the 2014 references to these documents, to identify research topics and trends in the field of cardiovascular disease. Methods and results: Text fragments were extracted from the titles and abstracts of 478 000 publications using natural language processing. Through machine-learning algorithms, these text fragments combined to identify specific topics across all publications. A second method, which included cross-references, assigned each publication document to a specific cluster. Experts named the topics and document clusters based on various outputs from these semi-Automatic methods. We identified and labelled 175 cardiovascular topics and 20 large document clusters, with concordance between the approaches. Overarching, strongly growing topics in clinical and population sciences are evidence-based guidance for treatment, research on outcomes, prognosis, and risk factors. 'Hot' topics include novel treatments in valve disease and in coronary artery disease, and imaging. Basic research decreases its share over time but sees substantial growth of research on stem cells and tissue engineering, as well as in translational research. Inflammation, biomarkers, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and lipids are hot topics across population, clinical and basic research, supporting integration across the cardiovascular field. Conclusion: Growth in clinical and population research emphasizes improving patient outcomes through novel treatments, risk stratification, and prevention.

The compression modulus of pebble cushion under various working conditions, the relationship between load and settlement are obtained. The effects of cushion thickness, ridge and furrow dimensions, preloading load and gradation on the mechanical properties of pebble cushion are analyzed. Unlike the gravel cushion, the settlement of pebble cushion initially changes nonlinearly with vertical load. With the increase of load, the settlement rate of the pebble cushion gradually decreases. The relationship between load and settlement tends to be linear after the cushion is compacted to a certain extent. The larger maximum size of the pebble results in a larger compression modulus of the cushion and a smaller settlement. The pre-compression leads to a significant reduction in the subsidence of the pebble cushion and an increase in compression modulus when compressed again.

Some of these challenges, such as how to best distribute risks and benefits, are likely to arise in the development of any new technology. Other challenges arise specifically because of the particular characteristics of M-CELS. For example, as an engineered living system becomes increasingly complex, it may provoke societal debate about its moral considerability, perhaps necessitating protection from harm or recognition of positive moral and legal rights, particularly if derived from cells of human origin. The use of emergence-based principles in M-CELS development may also create unique challenges, making the technology difficult to fully control or predict in the laboratory as well as in applied medical or environmental settings. In response to these challenges, we argue that the M-CELS community has an obligation to systematically address the ethical and societal aspects of research and to seek input from and accountability to a broad range of stakeholders and publics. As a newly developing field, M-CELS has a significant opportunity to integrate ethically responsible norms and standards into its research and development practices from the start. With the aim of seizing this opportunity, we identify two general kinds of salient ethical issues arising from M-CELS research, and then present a set of commitments to and strategies for addressing these issues. If adopted, these commitments and strategies would help define M-CELS as not only an innovative field, but also as a model for responsible research and engineering.', authkeywords='emergence | ethics | governance | moral considerability | responsible innovation | society', citedby_count=16, openaccess=0, freetoread='repositoryam', freetoreadLabel='Green', fund_acr='UIUC', fund_no='CBET0939511', fund_sponsor='University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85068456806', doi='10.1021/acs.iecr.9b00527', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Acceleration of the NVT Flash Calculation for Multicomponent Mixtures Using Deep Neural Network Models', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Li Y.', afid='60092945;60006019', affilname='King Abdullah University of Science and Technology;China University of Geosciences', affiliation_city='Thuwal;Wuhan', affiliation_country='Saudi Arabia;China', author_count='3', author_names='Li, Yiteng;Zhang, Tao;Sun, Shuyu', author_ids='57194063531;55547106035;8400915100', author_afids='60092945;60092945;60092945-60006019', coverDate='2019-07-10', coverDisplayDate='10 July 2019', publicationName='Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research', issn='08885885', source_id='13057', eIssn='15205045', aggregationType='Journal', volume='58', issueIdentifier='27', article_number=None, pageRange='12312-12322', description=\"Phase equilibrium calculation, also known as flash calculation, has been extensively applied in petroleum engineering, not only as a standalone application for a separation process but also as an integral component of compositional reservoir simulation. Previous research devoted numerous efforts to improve the accuracy of phase equilibrium calculations, which place more importance on safety than speed. However, the equation-of-state-based flash calculation consumes an enormous amount of computational time in compositional simulation and thus becomes a bottleneck to the broad application of compositional simulators. Therefore, it is of vital importance to accelerate flash calculation without much compromise in accuracy and reliability, turning it into an active research topic in the past two decades. With the rapid development of computational techniques, machine learning brings another wave of technology innovation. As a subfield of machine learning, the deep neural network becomes a promising computational technique due to its great capacity to deal with complicated nonlinear functions, and it thus attracts increasing attention from academia and industry. In this study, we establish a deep neural network model to approximate the iterative flash calculation at given moles, volume, and temperature, known as the NVT flash. A dynamic model designed for NVT flash problems is iteratively solved to generate data for training the neural network. In order to test the model's capacity to handle complex fluid mixtures, three real reservoir fluids are investigated, including one Bakken oil and two Eagle Ford oils. Compared to previous studies that follow the conventional flash framework in which stability testing precedes phase splitting calculation, we incorporate stability test and phase split calculation together and accomplish two steps by a single deep learning model. The trained model is able to identify the single vapor, single liquid, and vapor-liquid states under the subcritical region of the hydrocarbon mixtures. A number of examples are presented to show the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed deep neural network. It is found that the trained model makes predictions at most 244 times faster than the iterative NVT flash calculation for the given cases and meanwhile preserves high accuracy.\", authkeywords=None, citedby_count=40, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85062438325', doi='10.1108/ECAM-04-2018-0169', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='User-centric work environments in modular healthcare facilities', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Aalto L.', afid='60103653;60029080;60010493', affilname='Aalto University;Lääketieteellinen Tiedekunta;Työterveyslaitos', affiliation_city='Espoo;Helsinki;Helsinki', affiliation_country='Finland;Finland;Finland', author_count='7', author_names='Aalto, Leena;Sirola, Pia;Kalliomäki-Levanto, Tiina;Lahtinen, Marjaana;Ruohomäki, Virpi;Salonen, Heidi;Reijula, Kari', author_ids='10045061900;55948723300;6507162603;7003468067;35224062200;21743561600;57216607240', author_afids='60010493;60010493;60010493;60010493;60010493;60103653;60029080', coverDate='2019-07-10', coverDisplayDate='10 Jul 2019', publicationName='Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management', issn='09699988', source_id='15249', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='26', issueIdentifier='6', article_number=None, pageRange='1047-1062', description='Purpose: The challenges arising from the reform of the social and healthcare sector call for efficient, effective and novel processes in both public and private health and medical care.

Design/methodology/approach: This case study analyzed the different usability characteristics of the work environment in modular and non-modular healthcare facilities (HCFs). The qualitative research method was based on semi-structured interviews of employees and observations of the case buildings. Findings: According to the results, the usability characteristics were divided into four main categories: functionality, healthiness, safety/security and comfort. The main differences between the modular and non-modular facilities appeared to be room size, soundproofing, safety issues and the utilization of colors and artwork, which were all perceived as better realized in the non-modular facilities. The staff highlighted functionality as the most important characteristic in their work environment. They even considered functionality as a feature of a comfortable work environment.

Despite encouraging results, delayed translation can be attributed to limited knowledge on the concurrent mechanisms of biomaterial degradation in vivo, host inflammatory response, cell recruitment, and de novo tissue elaboration. This study aimed to reduce this gap by evaluating three alternative levels at which lability could be incorporated into candidate polyurethane materials electroprocessed into a valve scaffold. Specifically, polyester and polycarbonate labile soft segment diols were reacted into thermoplastic elastomeric polyurethane ureas that formed scaffolds where (1) a single polyurethane containing both of the two diols in the polymer backbone was synthesized and processed, (2) two polyurethanes were physically blended, one with exclusively polycarbonate and one with exclusively polyester diols, followed by processing of the blend, and (3) the two polyurethane types were concurrently processed to form individual fiber populations in a valve scaffold. The resulting valve scaffolds were characterized in terms of their mechanics before and after exposure to varying periods of pulsatile flow in an enzymatic (lipase) buffer solution. The results showed that valve scaffolds made from the first type of polymer and processing combination experienced more extensive degradation. This approach, although demonstrated with polyurethane scaffolds, can generally be translated to investigate biomaterial approaches where labile elements are introduced at different structural levels to alter degradation properties while largely preserving the overall chemical composition and initial mechanical behavior.', authkeywords=None, citedby_count=6, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85050660665', doi='10.1080/03043797.2018.1501348', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Sustainable development as a driver for educational innovation in engineering school: the case of UniLaSalle', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Fourati-Jamoussi F.', afid='60197895', affilname='UniLaSalle', affiliation_city='Beauvais', affiliation_country='France', author_count='5', author_names='Fourati-Jamoussi, Fatma;Dubois, Michel J.F.;Agnès, Maxime;Leroux, Valérie;Sauvée, Loïc', author_ids='56871195500;56870809600;56871085400;56871026500;8602632800', author_afids='60197895;60197895;60197895;60197895;60197895', coverDate='2019-07-04', coverDisplayDate='4 July 2019', publicationName='European Journal of Engineering Education', issn='03043797', source_id='11300153314', eIssn='14695898', aggregationType='Journal', volume='44', issueIdentifier='4', article_number=None, pageRange='570-588', description='The potential relationships between innovation and sustainability processes, in engineering education, is neither obvious nor simple, especially when innovation, generally speaking, is promoted regardless of sustainability.

We evaluated the impact of these innovations in two training sessions. In the first session, the revised Bloom’s taxonomy was introduced to the participants, and in the second session, the innovations were presented. In both sessions, participants were asked to classify ten exercises. The results show that classification into several cognitive processes was natural to instructors.

Survey research was applied to collect data from large private and public companies (n=275) that have already implemented large-scale ERP (e.g. SAP, ORACLE). ERP Success factors consist of top management support, project management competence, business process engineering, user involvement, knowledge sharing, organization readiness, ERP system quality, and communication with understanding. BSC elements include the four common dimensions of BSC research, organization learning and innovation, internal process improvement, employee satisfaction, and financial benefit to the organization. Results indicated that business process re-engineering has a significant impact on all four BSC dimensions. Other ERP success factors had an impact on some of the BSC factors. However, understanding, user involvement, and organization readiness did not show a significant impact on any of the BSC factors. Top management support showed a negative impact on organization learning and support, contrary to expectations. This paper provides a better understanding of ERP implementation success factors for large-scale ERP, assessing their impacts on the four components of the BSC. The general usefulness of BSC application to ERP is supported, but some inconsistency suggests that there is no one-size-fits-all.

The review showed that: the most popular teaching methods of teaching engineering and related programs in Nigeria are lecture method, laboratory experiment, field trip and final year practical project; the skills that the 21st century industry and 4IR demand are critical thinking, innovation and creativity, problem solving, teamwork, life-long learning, and communication skills; the teaching methods employed in Nigeria are not able to impart the needed skills. The researchers, therefore recommended innovative, students centered learning like problem based learning, project based learning, inquiry based learning and well as effective utilization of instructional resources like multimedia, simulations and virtual laboratory for the teaching and learning of engineering, science and technology programs.', authkeywords='Employability Skills | Engineering Education | Teaching Methods in Nigeria | Twenty-First Century Skills', citedby_count=6, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfree2read', freetoreadLabel='Bronze', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85070668039', doi='10.1002/jee.20283', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Entrepreneurial intent of engineering and business undergraduate students', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Gilmartin S.K.', afid='60141508;60025911;60012708;122989124', affilname='Stanford Engineering;Stanford Graduate School of Education;Stanford University;Earnin', affiliation_city='Stanford;Stanford;Stanford;Palo Alto', affiliation_country='United States;United States;United States;United States', author_count='7', author_names='Gilmartin, Shannon K.;Thompson, Marissa E.;Morton, Emily;Jin, Qu;Chen, Helen L.;Colby, Anne;Sheppard, Sheri D.', author_ids='10044181600;57203309870;57203816285;56249577100;27170656400;56680270900;7101928340', author_afids='60012708;60025911;60025911;122989124;60141508;60025911;60141508', coverDate='2019-07-01', coverDisplayDate='1 July 2019', publicationName='Journal of Engineering Education', issn='10694730', source_id='12481', eIssn='21689830', aggregationType='Journal', volume='108', issueIdentifier='3', article_number=None, pageRange='316-336', description=\"Background: In recent years, technological innovation and entrepreneurship have been emphasized in engineering education. There is a need to better understand which individual- and contextual-level factors are related to engineering students' entrepreneurial intentions. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study explores individual and contextual predictors of entrepreneurial intent among undergraduate women and men in engineering and business majors. Entrepreneurial intent is defined as the personal importance that students ascribe to starting a new business or organization. Design/Method: The participants included 518 engineering and 471 business undergraduates from 51 U.S. colleges and universities. We examined relationships first by discipline and then by gender in each discipline using regression models with interaction terms. Results: Innovation orientation and participation in entrepreneurship activities tied to intent more strongly for engineering students than for business students; in contrast, being at a research institution and selection of novel goals tied to intent more strongly for business students than for their engineering peers. Among engineering students only, being able to switch gears and apply alternative means for reaching one's goal in the face of setbacks was positively related with women's entrepreneurial intent but not with men's. Conclusions: Entrepreneurial intent is a function of individual-level characteristics and academic and social contexts, with some degree of discipline-specific effects. Diversifying the community of aspiring engineering entrepreneurs is a critical issue that merits attention by the engineering education community.\", authkeywords='cross-field comparison | entrepreneurship | gender | program design | regression', citedby_count=34, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherhybridgold', freetoreadLabel='Hybrid Gold', fund_acr='NSF', fund_no='1636442', fund_sponsor='National Science Foundation'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85068963407', doi='10.1097/TA.0000000000002350', pii=None, pubmed_id='31045737', title='Clinical implementation of the Humacyte human acellular vessel: Implications for military and civilian trauma care', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Morrison J.J.', afid='60115981;60013051;60006130', affilname='Syneos Health, Inc.;R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center;Walter Reed National Military Medical Center', affiliation_city='Morrisville;Baltimore;Bethesda', affiliation_country='United States;United States;United States', author_count='6', author_names='Morrison, Jonathan J.;McMahon, John;DuBose, Joseph J.;Scalea, Thomas M.;Lawson, Jeffrey H.;Rasmussen, Todd E.', author_ids='16064315500;57209888111;55308356300;7006529703;7402258174;7103159108', author_afids='60013051;60115981;60013051;60013051;60115981;60006130', coverDate='2019-07-01', coverDisplayDate='1 July 2019', publicationName='Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery', issn='21630755', source_id='21100206251', eIssn='21630763', aggregationType='Journal', volume='87', issueIdentifier='1 S', article_number=None, pageRange='S44-S47', description='The incidence of wartime vascular injury has increased and is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity.

Autologous vein is preferable but requires time to harvest and may not be available. Synthetic grafts are poorly resistant to infection and associated with thrombotic complications. Recognizing this capability gap, the US Combat Casualty Care Research Program has partnered with academia and industry to support the development and clinical introduction of a bioengineered human acellular vessel. This human acellular vessel has the potential to be an off-the-shelf conduit that is resistant to infection and incorporates well into native tissues.

In this context, anticipatory governance is an innovative approach to understanding technology and innovation futures. Anticipatory governance and its corollary anticipatory ethics on emerging technologies require interdisciplinary collaboration and communication to cultivate shared language, imagination, and orientation toward plausible sociotechnical innovation trajectories. This study reports, for the first time in the literature to the best of our knowledge, an anticipatory governance experiment on \"implementation precision medicine (IPM)\" using scenario analysis and design fiction. Participants were undergraduate students and experts who collaboratively imagined the plausible futures of precision medicine. Given the long history of the precision medicine field, and recent calls for translating big data to real-life clinical applications, implementation was chosen as a key focus area of precision medicine futures. We report here several plausible future innovation scenarios of interest to precision medicine scientists and engineers and researchers in the fields of emerging technology governance, responsible innovation, and social studies of science. Of importance, we found that the playful quality of the design fiction methodology and the pedagogical orientation facilitated by undergraduate student involvement created an engaging creative safe space to build transdisciplinary dialog examining the social and anticipatory ethics dimensions of IPM.

Yet the technical challenges and ecological concerns arise in the attempts to increase resource recovery. Shale reservoirs feature a low permeability water-sensitivity, and geological complexity, which call for more effective stimulation techniques to both reduce water use and boost production. It is believed that technology innovation such as waterless fracturing is the key to effectively improving unconventional resources recovery, while addressing the issue in reducing water consumption and environmental footprints. This paper investigates the development of two major waterless fracturing fluids, foams and liquid N2/CO2, including the advantages and challenges faced with waterless fracturing, fracturing mechanisms, and fluid properties such as stability and rheology. Based on literature review, it is believed that foam has a great potential to be a promising fracturing fluid in improving productivity and long-term production with benefits such as fast cleanup, improved proppant transport, and minimal environmental footprint. Foam properties such as stability and rheology have been continuously improved with technological advances in the stabilizing agents. Foams stabilized by nanoparticles are reported to significantly improved foam stability and rheology under reservoir conditions over conventional surfactants. Other fracturing fluids such as liquid CO2/N2 and gas fracturing fluids are designed to clear formation damage near the wellbore or for scenarios where long fractures are not desired, and both are faced with various technical challenges.

This analysis is very popular in the domains of urban governance, transportation engineering, logistics and geospatial information services for individuals or industrials. Importantly, data models of moving objects are one of the most crucial approaches to support the analysis for dynamic relative motion between moving objects, even in the age of big data and cloud computing. Traditional geographic information systems (GIS) usually organize moving objects as point objects in absolute coordinated space. The derivation of relative motions among moving objects is not efficient because of the additional geo-computation of transformation between absolute space and relative space. Therefore, current GISs require an innovative approach to directly store, analyze and interpret the relative relationships of moving objects to support their efficient analysis. This paper proposes a relative space-based GIS data model of moving objects (RSMO) to construct, operate and analyze moving objects’ relationships and introduces two algorithms (relationship querying and relative relationship dynamic pattern matching) to derive and analyze the dynamic relationships of moving objects. Three scenarios (epidemic spreading, tracker finding, and motion-trend derivation of nearby crowds) are implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed model. The experimental results indicates the execution times of the proposed model are approximately 5–50% those of the absolute GIS method for the same function of these three scenarios. It's better computational performance of the proposed model when analyzing the relative relationships of moving objects than the absolute methods in a famous commercial GIS software based on this experimental results. The proposed approach fills the gap of traditional GIS and shows promise for relative space-based geo-computation, analysis and service.\", authkeywords='GIS data model | Human dynamics | Moving objects | Relative space | Spatiotemporal analysis', citedby_count=9, openaccess=0, freetoread='repositoryvor', freetoreadLabel='Green', fund_acr='NSFC', fund_no='41231171', fund_sponsor='National Natural Science Foundation of China'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85065499078', doi='10.1016/j.jengtecman.2019.05.001', pii='S0923474817304599', pubmed_id=None, title='“From lab bench to store shelves:” A translational research & development framework for linking university science and engineering research to commercial outcomes', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Bazan C.', afid='60019000', affilname='Memorial University of Newfoundland', affiliation_city=\"St John's\", affiliation_country='Canada', author_count='1', author_names='Bazan, Carlos', author_ids='7003743154', author_afids='60019000', coverDate='2019-07-01', coverDisplayDate='July - September 2019', publicationName='Journal of Engineering and Technology Management - JET-M', issn='09234748', source_id='20575', eIssn='16084799', aggregationType='Journal', volume='53', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='1-18', description='Research conducted at the university can have considerable commercial potential.

In addition, innovation in products and the process of management make it competitive, and they considerably contribute to the growth of the company's performance. Therefore, the present research aims to study the relationship between the social and economic responsibilities with the financial performance through relying on the facilitating role of innovation. To accomplish this, 278 data samples were collected from the staff working for an oil engineering and development company (in the period of December 2017 to March 2018) based on a Likert scale questionnaire. Then the results were analysed using structural equation models together with Amos24 and SPSS22 software. The results of this study showed that the impact of economic responsibility on innovation is only positive and significant and the social responsibility cannot affect innovation changes. Also, innovation is ineffective in the financial performance of the oil engineering and development company. Hence, it is essential to use effective polices related to the companies' economic responsibility necessary for obtaining better long-term innovations. Moreover, it is suggested that the managers provide insights for improving the role of social responsibility in achieving future benefits and higher financial performances.\", authkeywords='Economic responsibility | financial performance | innovation | social innovation | social responsibility', citedby_count=8, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85063112251', doi='10.1016/j.ijpe.2019.02.015', pii='S0925527319300787', pubmed_id=None, title='Product upgrading or not: R&D tax credit, consumer switch and information updating', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Shi X.', afid='60010953;60010080', affilname='Donghua University;Nanjing University of Science and Technology', affiliation_city='Shanghai;Nanjing', affiliation_country='China;China', author_count='2', author_names='Shi, Xiutian;Shen, Bin', author_ids='55879887600;55206092200', author_afids='60010080;60010953', coverDate='2019-07-01', coverDisplayDate='July 2019', publicationName='International Journal of Production Economics', issn='09255273', source_id='19165', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='213', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='13-22', description='Research and Development (R&D) investment is critically important for an innovation firm to maintain market value.

In architectural design optimization (ADO) practice and research, the most commonly applied black-box algorithms are genetic algorithms or other metaheuristics, to the neglect of more current, global direct search or model-based, methods. Model-based methods construct a surrogate model (i.e., an approximation of a fitness landscape) that they refine during the optimization process. This benchmark compares metaheuristic, direct search, and model-based methods, and concludes that, for the given evaluation budget and problems, the model-based method (RBFOpt) is the most efficient and robust, while the tested genetic algorithms perform poorly.

Decentralized energy systems, powered by renewable energy technologies and incorporating storage and conversion technologies, are promising options to cope with this challenge. Many studies have evaluated their potential contributions, but an overview of the status-quo in both academia and practice is missing. The extant literature lacks a comprehensive review of the scientific knowledge on decentralized energy systems, partially attributed to the lack of common terminology. Additionally, it remains unclear what kind of systems are already implemented today worldwide as they have not yet been thoroughly analyzed and described. However, pilot projects provide valuable insights into future applications and operational aspects. To fill these gaps, an extensive review of the current state of literature and practice is conducted. To do so, 64 publications and 56 projects were analyzed and an overview is provided using four criteria: terminology, scope/motivation, application, and technical configuration. These criteria facilitate the understanding of decentralized energy systems needed to spur their development and diffusion. Further advancements of research and practice are discussed. For example, technological learning hinges on a common terminology and on an identification of optimal technical configurations per application. There are both avenues for future research.

The article focuses on a significant problem of developing education according to current innovative trends and challenges. The purpose of the research is to identify the criteria of educational innovation. Materials and Methods. The research methodology is based on the socio-cultural approach, which considers education as a leading, predictive institution of social development, due to the consistency of the definition of “innovation” with its semantic highlights characteristic for conceptual national documents. Results. In the context of global socio-cultural trends, the most general definition of “innovation” is explicated - as something new and effective in the context of preserving and developing anthropological potential. For the field of education, it is proposed to focus on a narrower understanding of innovation - in accordance with the social and technological tasks which appear in the conceptual national documents of the Russian Federation. Two more criteria are efficiency and essential novelty of educational innovation. To illustrate the theoretical findings based on the authors' “non-traditional” approach to learning (in the Western version the closest is the 'Flipped Classroom' technology) the characteristic features of innovative learning are revealed. Conclusions. The criteria of educational innovation in the context of Russian innovation-oriented socio-cultural reality are identified. They include methodological novelty, educational efficiency and compliance with the tasks of technological “breakthrough” of Russian Society. In terms of global trends in understanding the category of 'innovation' in Russian educational research investigations it is recommended to use such terms as “novelty” and “creation”.\", authkeywords='Blended learning | Creativity | Flipped classroom | Innovation | Inverted classroom | Non-traditional approach to learning | Practical training session', citedby_count=6, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85065503847', doi='10.1016/j.jprot.2019.04.014', pii='S1874391919301216', pubmed_id='31009804', title='Stathmin regulates the proliferation and odontoblastic/osteogenic differentiation of human dental pulp stem cells through Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Zhang X.', afid='60121737;60083491;60002593', affilname=\"Southern Medical University Stomatological Hospital;Hainan Provincial People's Hospital;Southern Medical University\", affiliation_city='Guangzhou;Haikou;Guangzhou', affiliation_country='China;China;China', author_count='9', author_names='Zhang, Xiaoyi;Ning, Tingting;Wang, He;Xu, Shuaimei;Yu, Haiyue;Luo, Xinghong;Hao, Chunbo;Wu, Buling;Ma, Dandan', author_ids='57195974501;57195976026;57089377300;55818670600;57194017766;57205128007;56865370600;7403590639;14052393700', author_afids='60002593;60002593;60002593;60002593-60121737;60002593;60002593;60083491;60002593;60002593', coverDate='2019-06-30', coverDisplayDate='30 June 2019', publicationName='Journal of Proteomics', issn='18743919', source_id='11700154304', eIssn='18767737', aggregationType='Journal', volume='202', issueIdentifier=None, article_number='103364', pageRange=None, description='Odontoblastic/osteogenic differentiation of human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs)is a key factor in tooth and pulp regeneration, but its mechanism still remains unknown. The purpose of this research is to look into the mechanism by which Stathmin affects the proliferation and odontoblastic/osteogenic differentiation of hDPSCs, and whether the Wnt/β- catenin is related to this regulation. First, the Stathmin expression was inhibited by lentiviral vector, after that the transcriptome sequencing technology was used to screen the differentially expressed genes, then we found Wnt5a which related to the regulation of Wnt/β-catenin was regulated. Comparing with hDPSC in the control group, the shRNA-Stathmin group inhibited proliferation and odontoblastic/osteogenic differentiation. The result of molecular analysis indicated that the Wnt/β-catenin was inhibited when Stathmin was silenced. After that, the shRNA-Stathmin group were added with LiCl (activator of Wnt/β-catenin), and the Wnt/β-catenin was significantly activated in β-catenin. After activation of the Wnt/β-catenin, the proliferation of hDPSCs was significantly increased and the expression of genes related to odontoblastic/osteogenic differentiation was also significantly increased. Taken together, these findings reveal for the first time that the Stathmin-Wnt/β-catenin plays a positive regulatory role in hDPSC proliferation and odontoblastic/osteogenic differentiation. Significance: Transcriptome sequencing revealed that Stathmin interacts with Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway-related proteins such as Wnt5a. At the same time, experiments have confirmed that Stathmin protein can affect the proliferation and odontogenetic differentiation of hDPSCs.The innovation of this paper is to link the Stathmin and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways for the first time, to explore the interaction of Stathmin and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways and the mechanism of this regulation on human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs)of odontoblastic/osteogenic differentiation and proliferation function. Especially for the regulation of odontoblastic/osteogenic differentiation, we have verified this mechanism at the molecular level and characterization leveland this regulation also provides new ideas for dental pulp tissue engineering. At the same time, more than 3000 proteins related to the change of Stathmin level were screened by transcriptome sequencing technology, which provided a possibility to further exploration of the regulation mechanism of Stathmin on various aspects of cell biological characteristics.', authkeywords='Odontoblastic/osteogenic differentiation | Proliferation and migration | Stathmin | Wnt/β-catenin', citedby_count=29, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='NSFC', fund_no='81400495', fund_sponsor='National Natural Science Foundation of China'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85073148698', doi='10.1145/3348400.3348413', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Improving learning through cloud-based mobile technologies and virtual and augmented reality for australian higher education', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Sandu N.', afid='60031003', affilname='CQUniversity Australia', affiliation_city='Rockhampton', affiliation_country='Australia', author_count='3', author_names='Sandu, Nitirajsingh;Gide, Ergun;Karim, Shakir', author_ids='57207950327;22978864000;57195906070', author_afids='60031003;60031003;60031003', coverDate='2019-06-28', coverDisplayDate='28 June 2019', publicationName='ACM International Conference Proceeding Series', issn=None, source_id='11600154611', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='1-5', description='Latest technological innovations like Cloud-based mobile technologies and virtual and Augmented Reality (AR) have the ability to create great learning experiences.

To this end, this paper first proposes a novel conception of smart dispatching for EI with a complex cyber-physical-social system (CPSS) network from the perspective of parallel dispatch, called parallel dispatching robot (PDR), and investigates the implementations of PDR based on smart artificial society (SAS) modeling. First, we introduce EI and describe the dispatching issues of EI. Second, we discuss several important concepts supporting the parallel dispatch conception of EI, including knowledge automation (KA), CPSS, and parallel machine learning (PML). On the basis of these, we elaborate the concept of parallel dispatch. Moreover, we construct a large closed-loop feedback control framework of parallel dispatch for EI integrating a CPSS network based on KA and PML. Third, we establish an experimental platform for PDR research based on the proposed parallel dispatch framework. Fourth, we develop the PML-based SAS models of a single PDR in centralized dispatching modes and group PDRs in decentralized dispatching modes to achieve crowd wisdom emergence and performance improvement in current cyber-physical system frameworks of EI. Moreover, we design an external global closed loop for PDR to evaluate its operation stability. Lastly, we conduct a detailed discussion on PDR and offer some prospects for its engineering implementations.

To date, the role of the organization has been examined in coordinating GSE activities because of the prevalence of the logic of rationality (i.e., the efficiency ethos, mechanical methods, and mathematical analysis) and indeterminacy (i.e., the effectiveness ethos, natural methods, and functional analysis). This logic neglects the coordination role of ICT. However, GSE itself is an organizational mode that is technology-begotten, technology-dominated, and technology-driven, as is its coordination. GSE is a direct reflection of ICT innovation, change, and use, yet research into the role technology of GSE has been neglected. Global Software Engineering: Virtualization and Coordination considers existing fragmented explanations and perspectives in GSE research, poses new questions about GSE, and proposes a framework based on the logic of virtuality (i.e., creativity ethos, electrical methods, and technological analysis) rather than of rationality and indeterminacy.

This gap may be traced back to several complex issues including perceived cultural concerns in engineering and young women self-selecting out of engineering career paths early in the middle school years [1]. Informal education settings may allow for a countermeasure to the cultural concerns which discourage female participation in the engineering sector. This case study reports on an informal engineering education program for 13 and 15-year-old girls, which fosters an environment where young women build interest, skills, confidence and an understanding of how their own goals, such as helping people, align with traditional STEM careers with a focus on engineering careers. This low-stakes setting, with high quality teachers, researchers and engineering students, allows for risk taking and experimentation which may be refined and expanded into the traditional classroom setting. Of particular interest, is how this informal setting may be used to strengthen this population's ability to make crosscutting concept connections in new ways and how this may be tied to motivation. This informal education program includes building participants' understanding of how their prior knowledge ties into engineering practices, their science core content knowledge and their crosscutting concept connections. Most importantly, student learning is centered on how crosscutting concepts in science pair with observations, insights and innovation in engineering design and problem solving. Participants come to the program with varying knowledge of engineering and science practices, core science concepts and crosscutting concepts prior to their participation in the program and this diversity of experience is considered in the programming.

Solving today's complex challenges will require cooperation among experts from many fields. Successful leaders must harness the diverse capabilities of teams composed of these experts and be technically skilled. Undergraduate engineering students can fill this need by learning how to be effective leaders during their formation as engineers. Unfortunately, many engineering students graduate with little development of leadership skills; engineering educators do not currently have a sufficient understanding of how engineering students develop into leaders. This NSF ECE supported project seeks to improve educators' understanding of the interaction between leadership and engineering identities in the formation of undergraduate engineers. This work postulates that a cohesive engineering leadership identity should exist at the intersection of engineering and leadership identities. Now entering its second year the project is wrapping up its quantitative phase and is beginning the qualitative phase of investigation. This paper discusses the process of developing the qualitative research protocols used to explore identity formation in groups of undergraduate engineers at three different campuses. The discussion shows the formation of the protocol using prior work in leadership and engineering identity constructs from both this project and the literature. The protocol development, methods, and findings from early interviews are presented. Initial findings suggest several factors are important to engineering educators interested in developing engineers who are ready to lead. The findings include evidence of some level of conflict between engineering identity and leadership identity as well as further evidence of engineering students' compartmentalization of leadership as outside of engineering. In addition, this paper includes the learning outcomes of three REU students who joined the project to assist with the development of the qualitative protocol. The REU students made significant contributions to initial data collection as participants and observers. The REU students were the lead authors of this paper.\", authkeywords=None, citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='NSF', fund_no='EEC-1664231', fund_sponsor='National Science Foundation'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85078809324', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title=\"Concept maps as an assessment tool for evaluating students' perception of entrepreneurial mind-set\", subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Martine M.M.', afid='60016602;100603477', affilname='Rowan University;Colorado Christian University', affiliation_city='Glassboro;Lakewood', affiliation_country='United States;United States', author_count='6', author_names='Martine, Marissa Mary;Mahoney, Lia X.;Sunbury, Christina M.;Schneider, John Austin;Hixson, Cory;Bodnar, Cheryl A.', author_ids='57214467546;57214452283;57214470818;57214466277;55336790400;13007966300', author_afids='60016602;60016602;60016602;60016602;100603477;60016602', coverDate='2019-06-15', coverDisplayDate='15 June 2019', publicationName='ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings', issn=None, source_id='21100797240', eIssn='21535965', aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description=\"With today's growing competitive economic market, having an entrepreneurial mindset can be instrumental for success. An entrepreneurial mindset encompasses the way a person thinks about a new idea, product, or innovation [1]. It can include elements such as approaches to product development, the ability to mitigate risk, creating new professional networks, and the ability to accept failure [2]. Students in both engineering and business can benefit from these skills, as these skills have widespread application in today's professional environments. In order to better understand how both business and engineering students perceived the term “entrepreneurial mindset,” this study utilized concept mapping to visually elicit business and engineering students' perspectives. Concept mapping is a useful assessment tool since it outlines relationships between ideas and concepts [3]. Using a concept map, it is possible to observe how students connect different attributes and topics to an overarching theme (in our case: “entrepreneurial mindset”). Two different methods of scoring concept maps were used: traditional and holistic. Using the concept maps, this study aimed to determine whether there were any observable differences between the two scoring methods. It also sought to determine whether concept maps produced by engineering undergraduates differed from those produced by business undergraduates In total, 19 engineering students and 6 business students participated in this study. We found that holistic and traditional scoring methods provided similar evaluation of the concept maps. The scoring methods were only able to reproducibly score the lower scoring concept maps whereas the remaining maps showed more variability. These differences may be due to the priorities of each scoring method. Traditional scoring is based on the quantity of information portrayed and the ability to create connections between topics. Holistic scoring is based on the range of topics involved with the main subject, the structure of the concept map, and the quality and correctness of each concept and connection. There were no statistically significant differences found between the traditionally and holistically scored concepts maps for either major although a medium effect size was observed when comparing participants' holistic comprehensiveness scores across disciplines. Results from this study demonstrate that when seeking to evaluate students' perceptions of an entrepreneurial mindset, the application of holistic scoring methods may be more effective in distinguishing detailed conceptual knowledge. Alternatively, the traditional scoring method may be more helpful when seeking a broader understanding of students' knowledge of a concept. Overall, each scoring method has its own benefits and disadvantages; therefore, the evaluation method selected should be based upon the focus of the research.\", authkeywords=None, citedby_count=13, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='KEEI', fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='Korea Energy Economics Institute'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85078805440', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Design and prototyping of two different mechanical testing instruments', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Osta A.', afid='60016602', affilname='Rowan University', affiliation_city='Glassboro', affiliation_country='United States', author_count='2', author_names='Osta, Anu;Kadlowec, Jennifer', author_ids='57192003712;6603336840', author_afids='60016602;60016602', coverDate='2019-06-15', coverDisplayDate='15 June 2019', publicationName='ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings', issn=None, source_id='21100797240', eIssn='21535965', aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description=\"The modern human society is largely being faced with complex engineering challenges that are not confined to any particular engineering or science discipline.

Project 1 involved designing a pharmaceutical vial seal force tester in collaboration with a local equipment manufacturing company. Seal force is the integrity of the sealing quality of the rubber stoppers that cap the pharmaceutical drug vials. The usual process of testing it is by performing a compressive test. The entire prototyping was accomplished in various phases. Project 2 was an independent undertaking that was conducted over a period of 2 semesters during which the student-faculty team conceived and developed an idea for marketing a low-cost mechanical testing equipment. The idea was to build a tensile, compressive tester using off the shelf component, keeping the selling price below $2500 per piece.

More specifically, assessment findings showed that researchers: (1) identified a need for assistance with technical writing, communication skills, search strategies, and ethical use of information; (2) expected new services encompassing data management, authorship, copyright, and organizing, sharing, and preserving information in the digital environment; and (3) needed a collaborative space where teaching and research services coincided. A grant, awarded by the U.S. Department of Education, has enabled the UPRM to facilitate research services across campus, broadening graduate offering in engineering programs and sustaining the research and innovation ecosystem across the entire research lifecycle. This award allowed the design and inauguration of the Graduate Research and Innovation Center (GRIC) in 2016, transforming the way the Library intervenes in our institution's research ecosystem. Overall, the GRIC provides (1) a holistic suite of services in which students can be referred to specialists, knowledgeable in the proper technology or content development expertise; (2) a robust technological infrastructure to support interdisciplinary and interactive collaborations; and (3) support to graduate students' needs as both information consumers and information producers.

To develop an innovation-based ecosystem, the US must produce more STEM graduates capable of driving innovation. “At the heart of an innovative local ecosystem is its capacity to absorb new knowledge for industrial use. Industrial innovation is defined by the capability and propensity to engage, translate, absorb and exploit new knowledge and the active participation of a university, including facilities, faculty, staff and students who can aid this process.” [2] In 2018, the US declined from fourth to sixth in the Global Innovation Index with the United Kingdom (fourth) and Singapore (fifth) advancing. [3] The 19 States comprising the “American Heartland” have a State Technology and Science Index (STSI) significantly below the mean for the US. And, five states in the southern Heartland are in the bottom ten for the country. [4] Research Universities can be (and are) major sources of innovation through the commercialization of their research. However, research does not need to be the only source of innovation from research universities. Innovation can also come through students by way of purposely developed or enhanced courses, pedagogy, and experiences designed to create a spark or foster an existing spark, fan the flames, and fuel them to help them grow. It is unfortunate to create the spark in first-year students and then ignore it until it is time for the senior design / capstone project; the innovators need to continue to learn, experience, and grow throughout their academic career. To be a meaningful real-world experience, an innovation concentration needs to incorporate learning and experiences within disciplines students will encounter once they have begun their professional career including: engineering (of many types); business, marketing, finance, accounting, manufacturing, supply chain, sales, and management; industrial design, architecture, science, service and support; and, an understanding of business customers and users - from first-year through to capstone. Translating this into pedagogy and curriculum means innovation-based or innovation-infused courses, problem-based and active learning-based, real-world experiences in partnership with the innovation ecosystem and a progression based on gaining knowledge, skills, and experience. And, to match the real-world, these courses need to be interdisciplinary, multi-disciplinary, transdisciplinary, and multi-college / multi-school (engineering, business, arts & sciences, architecture, etc.). Innovation is at the Venn diagram intersection of engineering, creativity and business, at the core of what is commercialized and provides the basis for entrepreneurship. Innovation is not a solution looking for a problem; it is a solution for a need.

Desktop-based virtual reality presents a 3-dimensional (3D) world using the display of a standard desktop computer available in most of the PC labs on campus. This is a required course at this university that has students not only from the primary department, but from other colleges/departments as well. Desktop VR has been chosen as a medium for this study due to the ease-of-access and affordability; this framework can be visualized and accessed with the available computers in PC labs available in university campuses. The proposed research is intended to serve as a low-cost framework that can be accessed by all students. The concepts of 'computer graphics, modeling & animation', instead of being presented using conventional methods such as notes or power point presentations, are presented in an interactive manner on a desktop display. This framework allows the users to interact with the objects on the display not only via the standard mouse and keyboard, but also using multiple forms of HCI such as Touchscreen, Touchpad, and 3D Mouse. Hence, the modules were developed from scratch for access via regular desktop PCs.

Finally, the framework has also been tested on a range of VR media to check its accessibility. On the whole, this proposed framework can be used to not only teach basic modeling and animation concepts such as spatial coordinates, coordinate systems, transformation, and parametric curves, but it is also used to teach basic graphics programming concepts. Hence, instead of a touchscreen, the modules have to be developed from scratch for access via regular desktop PCs.

Without a central notion of AM, the competencies and professional identities of AM workers are likewise unclear. In an effort to address this consensus gap, we undertook an extensive systematic review of AM definitions to chart of sector's topography, in an effort to understand AM's breadth and depth. The goals of this study were to: 1) define AM as perceived by policymakers and 2) identify important concepts and contextual factors that comprise and shape our understanding of AM. In this study, we used systematic policy and literature review approach to analyze canonical and research-based publications pertaining to AM's origins, components, and operational definitions. We classified, compared, and synthesized definitions of AM depending by stakeholder, for example, professional organizations, government agencies, or educational program accreditors. Among our notable findings is that in the eyes of policymakers, manufacturers are advanced not because they make certain products, but because they have adopted sophisticated business models and production techniques. Advanced manufacturers typically use a combination of three factors to remain competitive: “advanced knowledge,” “advanced processes,” and “advanced business models.” This study is both timely and important because in a dynamic field such as AM, educators and industry leaders must work together to meet workforce needs. Clear understanding of AM can inform competency models, bodies of knowledge, and empirical research that documents school-to-career pathways.

Survey items were validated through exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Subsequently, paired t-tests were used to analyze if, and how, these metrics changed within individual students over the course of one semester using the makerspace.

Moreover, from a wide variety of perspectives, it is possible to identify that the understanding of physics progressed as more complex mathematical ideas became available. In pedagogical practice, there are many instances where the teaching of one of these disciplines might obstruct the understanding of the other; this problem, combined with the difficulty of teaching them inside or outside a classroom, produces a ripe opportunity for educative improvement. After a significant experience of teaching an integrated physics-math course for freshmen undergraduate students, a number of inconsistencies were identified and previously reported. One of those inconsistencies is a trap rooted in language, and it creates worrying cognitive conflicts that interfere with students' learning. Specifically, the use by teachers of different names for the same concepts or ideas (perhaps because they look to relate specific concepts to everyday language) might be helping misconceptions to prevail. In this work, the authors focused on the analysis of terms like mass, force, and torque. To do this, they analyzed various research sources and texts to identify the roots of different names for similar concepts and their uses, and they considered the consequences of differing terminology and meaning to the construction of complex thinking. Raising awareness about the inconsistencies of terminology in mathematics and physics and the resulting consequences is the primary objective of this study. This work was motivated by an authentic concern to facilitate the learning and comprehension of these subjects by students. Accordingly, the authors issue a call for action for a transformation in the teaching and learning of physics and mathematics through reflection on better use of terminology in these fields, so that the terms are negotiated between the disciplines, which results in precise descriptions of what is being taught, free of inconsistencies, confusion, and conflict.\", authkeywords='Conflicts in physics and math terminologies | Educational innovation | Interdisciplinary negotiation | Language of math | Physics | Physics and math integration | Words and meaning', citedby_count=1, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='ITESM', fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85078782591', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='A new approach in abolishing poverty: A case study and construction strategy for integrating inclusive innovation into engineering ethics education', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Li H.', afid='60003970;123831168', affilname='Zhejiang University;Chinese Society for Engineering Education (CSEE', affiliation_city='Hangzhou;', affiliation_country='China;', author_count='4', author_names='Li, Heng;Xie, Yanjie;Yang, Shuxin;Xu, Ruixue', author_ids='57251043000;57214454470;57195966786;57214441646', author_afids='60003970;60003970;123831168;60003970', coverDate='2019-06-15', coverDisplayDate='15 June 2019', publicationName='ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings', issn=None, source_id='21100797240', eIssn='21535965', aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description=\"At present, macro engineering ethics urgently requires the engineering talents to play a positive role in realizing human welfare, maintaining social justice and world equality. Therefore, it is necessary to think about how to make engineering students better participate in solving major social development problems through engineering ethics education, especially with the help of engineering students' professional knowledge and product design ability to help 2.47 billion people in the world “tackle poverty and get rich”. Inclusive innovation proposes a new idea for solving this problem. Promoting the economic prosperity and abolishing poverty in developing countries are the purpose of inclusive innovation which guided by the idea of “building a community with a shared future for mankind”. This paper attempts to explore how to integrate inclusive innovation into engineering ethics education in order to provide a viable solution for improving the ability of engineering students to promote positive social change. Firstly, on the basis of explaining the connotation, characteristics and national practice of inclusive innovation, this paper puts forward that the core goals and philosophical starting points of engineering ethics and inclusive innovation are consistent, which provides the possibility and necessity for integrating inclusive innovation into engineering ethics education. Secondly, through the case analysis framework, which includes the three dimensions of “Concept-Pedagogy-Output”, we systematically analyzed the typical case of MIT D-Lab. Our paper finds that MIT D-Lab has developed the educational tenet from three levels of knowledge, consciousness and ability. Meanwhile, this tenet is achieved through interdisciplinary courses, technology development and community activities. In the end, engineering students can play the role of “product/service designer” and “technology promoter” in inclusive innovation, and provide affordable products and service to poor areas through “knowledge creation” and “product innovation”. In conclusion, this paper offers suggestions for integrating inclusive innovation into engineering ethics education in four aspects: (1) constructing the curriculum content system solving the poverty problem; (2) building a high-quality interdisciplinary teaching team; (3) using multi-functional collaborative external support network; and (4) innovative teaching methods to expose engineering students to the “real world”.\", authkeywords='Case Study | Engineering Ethics Education | Inclusive Innovation | MIT D-Lab | Poverty alleviation', citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='2016GCZD02', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85078782539', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Entrepreneurial engineering education - A research experience for undergraduates focused on entrepreneurship and technical innovation', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Burkey D.D.', afid='60022659;123830659', affilname='University of Connecticut;SurePath Evaluations LLC', affiliation_city='Storrs;', affiliation_country='United States;', author_count='4', author_names='Burkey, Daniel D.;Bozorgmanesh, Hadi;Srivastava, Manisha;Mendes, Randi', author_ids='6603738067;56821866100;57214442233;58344393700', author_afids='60022659;60022659;123830659;60022659', coverDate='2019-06-15', coverDisplayDate='15 June 2019', publicationName='ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings', issn=None, source_id='21100797240', eIssn='21535965', aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description=None, authkeywords=None, citedby_count=2, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='NSF', fund_no='1560072', fund_sponsor='National Science Foundation'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85078781852', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Integrating mind, hand, and heart: How students are transformed by hands-on designing and making', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Brubaker E.R.', afid='60012708', affilname='Stanford University', affiliation_city='Stanford', affiliation_country='United States', author_count='5', author_names='Brubaker, Eric Reynolds;Maturi, Vikas Rammohan;Karanian, Barbara A.;Sheppard, Sheri;Beach, David', author_ids='57219465124;57214463172;6602775772;7101928340;7103190519', author_afids='60012708;60012708;60012708;60012708;60012708', coverDate='2019-06-15', coverDisplayDate='15 June 2019', publicationName='ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings', issn=None, source_id='21100797240', eIssn='21535965', aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description=\"Hands-on education - the integration of mind and hands - is often believed to transform the way that students think and learn. How and how much are students changed by hands-on education, and by what mechanisms do such transformations occur? This exploratory study considers 75 students in a 10-week engineering design and manufacturing course where, in many cases, students design and build a physical product for the first time. Students participate in labs through which they gain hands-on experience in milling, turning, forming, welding, and sand casting, among other manufacturing processes. Additionally, through several iterations of an individual project, each student builds a functional, high-fidelity, well-finished prototype of their own design. Drawing from Dewey alongside Lave and Wenger's theories of learning through experience and participation in communities of practice, we observe how students engage their mind, hands, and heart in a makerspace environment and the subsequent changes that they experience. We hypothesize that greater integration of students' mind, hands, and heart is associated with increased engineering task self-efficacy, innovation self-efficacy, engineering identity, and closeness of connection to a maker community. To examine these hypotheses, pre- and post-course surveys were administered in addition to written reflections throughout the course. Pre-post comparisons are performed on quantitative constructs and qualitative reflections contextualize the interpretation. Findings suggest that participation in this hands-on learning course is associated with large positive transformations in innovation self-efficacy, engineering task self-efficacy, and perceived connection between the self and maker community, and that these gains occur in all examined subgroups. On average, students report large increases in perceived connection between their “mind and hands” and “heart and hands,” with underrepresented minority (URM) women and non-URM men experiencing the largest increases in mind-hand-heart connection. Future research may examine how different groups of students, e.g. URM women, approach designing and making in academic makerspaces and how they come to perceive exceptional integration of mind, hand, and heart. Our findings also point to the underexplored and potentially substantial role of emotion in makerspace learning environments.

Over the first two years of the study, capstone design students in the United States Air Force Academy's Department of Engineering Mechanics were each assigned to one of 14 teams which received various learning experiences (treatments) intended to enhance individual creativity and design project innovation. Twelve of the 14 teams (n = 70) received an innovative engineering design curriculum while the control teams (n = 23) did not. Six teams (n = 37) experienced seven weekly creativity exercises across the fall semester, provided by Destination Imagination, while four teams (n = 56) did not. It was expected that the exercises would improve Creativity Index scores in students across the study as measured by the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT) Figural Test. The Creativity Index scores of the students were analyzed using an independent sample t-test to determine if any differences could be detected. Results after the first two years are positive, indicating that students that participated in the creativity enhancing treatments showed higher improvements in Creativity Index scores compared to the controls. However, the statistical significance of these findings are not strong, presumably due to the small sample size. Therefore, the research will continue in subsequent years.

Overall, Ingeniería 2030 granted about US$60 millions over a six-year period. As a result, engineering schools implemented unprecedented efforts to promote and support entrepreneurship among undergraduate students. In this context, we pose the following question: What are the main strategies the selected engineering schools use for the promotion of entrepreneurship education? To address this question, we conducted 20 semi-structured interviews with professional staff (12) in the newly created entrepreneurship units, as well as top administrators (3) and faculty members (5). We also analyzed archival documentation, such as web sites and Ingeniería 2030 reports. The results indicate that the main strategies for supporting entrepreneurship education are related to four issues. First, a tension exists in these mostly traditional schools in terms of their role as conventional institutions and what is expected of them as entrepreneurial schools. Second, schools struggle with balancing and connecting curricular and co-curricular activities. Third, professional staff and administrators view engineering faculty members as conflicted by research demands on the one hand, and pressure to get involved in entrepreneurship educational initiatives on the other. Fourth, regular academic demands are seen as a barrier to get more students involved in entrepreneurial activities.

Furthermore, we investigate what entrepreneurs were already doing as students in order to gather relevant skills for starting a venture. While previous research has focused more on Entrepreneurial Intentions within either engineering or business majors [1], or on the psychological side of intentions [2], this current work bridges the gap between intentions and Entrepreneurial Actions. Our work is based on qualitative semi-structured interviews of participants in the Engineering Majors Survey (EMS) 1. All 16 interviewees participated at least at two of the three nationally-representative, longitudinal Engineering Majors Surveys. The EMS is a survey designed to explore engineering students' technical, innovation, and entrepreneurial interests and experiences over time. The interviewees in this study had relatively high Entrepreneurial Intentions compared to the average of all EMS participants. Furthermore, they are categorized into three groups, that are characterized by people with increasing Entrepreneurial Intentions, decreasing Entrepreneurial Intention, or those whose intentions remained constant during the surveys. Our open-ended interview questions were based on Flanagans' critical incident method [3] and enabled additional follow-up questions in order to deepen understanding of certain answers and situations. All interviews were recorded, transcribed and coded according to Corbin and Strauss' [4] inductive coding strategy. The analysis of the codes shows that students and early career professionals value the possibility of having an impact as well as taking responsibility for founding their own company.

One approach institutions have taken towards achieving this is through the use of makerspaces. Anecdotal and indirect evidence support the use of these facilities to improve engineering skills in students. The makerspace of interest was built two years ago employing many of the best practices used at other institutions, and is also an integral part of a larger program at the university. To date, minimal data has been collected concerning the efficacy of the makerspace. To assess the makerspace, an anonymous survey comprised of Likert scale items, open-ended questions, and other quantitative questions was distributed electronically to both undergraduate and graduate engineering students. It asked students to rate statements about the makerspace related to its mission, and to rate statements about how using the space has improved different aspects of themselves. The results of the survey showed that the makerspace appears to be achieving its goals and is functioning as part of the university's efforts to increase student innovation and entrepreneurship. It showed that students feel using the makerspace has had positive effects on them, especially their creative thinking and ability to work on a team.

Global issues, technological innovation, expansion of discipline boundaries, and increased professional expectations are transforming what engineers do and how they do it. Society is demanding engineering graduates, with strong technical knowledge who can think creatively and critically, effectively communicate, and work in teams to solve challenging problems. The earliest engineering disciplines, civil, mechanical and electrical, have given rise to distinct engineering specialties and application‐based disciplines. Many contemporary engineering problems are considered to be multi‐disciplinary in nature and require systems thinking in problem formulation and solution. It is clear that we must educate engineering students for a technological era of increased scope, scale and complexity. Future engineering expertise will require a higher intellectual level than currently provided. Research and anecdotal information identify a trend in the demand for graduate level education prior to entering the workforce that encompasses both hard technical and soft non-technical skills. Technology and industry needs are influential factors in education. Industry relies on distinctive skills to innovate and compete and engineering students expect that academic institutions will introduce them to appropriate technologies for their successful transformation into industry. Thus, academic institutions are challenged to adopt appropriate strategies to meet the innovative educational demand by both students and industry [1]. To address the increasing industry demand for workers to have advanced education and the accompanying increase in undergraduate engineering enrollment, The Citadel developed new MS graduate degrees in three programs to meet demands. By employing a multi-disciplinary approach existing non-technical graduate degree courses, focusing on management and leadership, that can be taken to fulfill electives better prepare graduate students to meet employer and industry requirements. As a result, MS engineering programs have seen increased enrollments and partnerships with other departments and industry connections. Various elective tracts provide the opportunity for students to earn graduate certificates in soft skills in addition to technical MS degree in just 10 courses. Given that the target population are working professionals, students take courses in the evening and can complete a MS degree in less than two years. This paper discusses the development of the three new MS programs with specific details on the mechanical program for technical course work paired with the project management for non-technical coursework. Additional details are provided on the development of online offerings for future students who do not have the option for face to face classes. Qualitative and quantitative student feedback are also discussed, showing the positive impact the programs have on engineering, as well as students' positive perceptions of the programs for preparation of professional skills.\", authkeywords=None, citedby_count=5, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85078745043', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title=\"Student persistence and university transitions in STEM majors: Community college students' challenges and successes\", subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Ragusa G.', afid='60029311', affilname='University of Southern California', affiliation_city='Los Angeles', affiliation_country='United States', author_count='1', author_names='Ragusa, Gisele', author_ids='25655216600', author_afids='60029311', coverDate='2019-06-15', coverDisplayDate='15 June 2019', publicationName='ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings', issn=None, source_id='21100797240', eIssn='21535965', aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description=\"There is a critical need for more students with engineering and science majors to enter into, persist, and graduate from postsecondary institutions. Increasing the diversity in engineering and science is also a profound identified need. According to national statistics, the largest groups of underrepresented minority students in engineering and science attend United States public higher education institutions and in particular the community colleges. Recent research has indicated that students from these populations who are strong problem solvers, and who understand how to seek assistance and navigate college campuses are most likely persist to degree completion. Accordingly, this research examined a sample of non-traditional college students enrolled in science and engineering programs in nine urban community colleges to determine (a) the types and frequency of support practices they utilized, (b) how such practices influenced their achievement, persistence and transfer status to four-year colleges and universities, and (c) how in turn their propensity for innovation and creative problem solving affected such choices and persistence. The study analyzed the impact of pedagogical support practices-practices designed to foster successful transfer from community college to four-year colleges and universities, and how students' innovative capability affected such transfer capacity. The goals were: (a) to understand whether particular pedagogical support practices were effective in offering nontraditional students a program that enabled them to persist in engineering and science majors and to transfer to a four-year college or university, and (b) to determine if students' propensity for innovative problem solving influenced their use of pedagogical practices and ultimately, transfer persistence. The research targeted four research questions: (1) What are the patterns of pedagogical practices that community colleges employ to enhance students' transfer success in engineering and science? (2) How do students' creative and innovative problem-solving approaches influence the choices that they make in using pedagogical support practices? (3) What are the impacts of pedagogical practices and differences among pedagogical practices on persistence toward students' transfer to colleges and universities? (4) How do students' creative and innovative problem-solving approaches influence their persistence toward transfer to engineering and science programs at four-year universities? This research is ongoing and involves a multi-stage study in which in the first stage, the types of pedagogical support practices used in community colleges were analyzed and taxonomized at four community colleges. Results of this part of the research led to the delineation and refining of three categories of student pedagogical support: (1) College attending support, (2) Program planning and execution support, and (3) Classroom and program performance support. These categories led to development and refinement of a college level pedagogical practice taxonomy and inventory which was used in a second and third stage of the research in which data was collected on 4929 community college students in STEM majors. The intent of the research is to determine the role of students' creativity and propensity of innovation on their persistence in STEM and the impact that use of particular pedagogical support practices had on persistence, creativity and propensity for innovation in STEM. Structural equation models (SEMs) have been developed and updated with multiple rounds of data collection. These models have been used for data analyses with one containing grade point average (as a proxy for achievement) as the outcome of interest and the second with engineering creativity and propensity for innovation as the outcome of interest, both of which address the study's research questions. Thus far the models indicate that frequency of use of pedagogical practices impact students' creativity and propensity for innovation and propensity for innovation impacts students' achievement (GPA). Notably, students' background characteristics also have pronounced impacts on the two outcomes of interest. In addition to informing engineering education research, this research provides community college faculty and student affairs personnel with insight as to which types of student support practices best support students in STEM majors to transfer to colleges and universities and how students' creativity and propensity for innovation affects students' transfer persistence.\", authkeywords=None, citedby_count=1, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='NSF', fund_no='EEC-1429229', fund_sponsor='National Science Foundation'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85078744234', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Preliminary findings from a comparative study of two bio-inspired design methods in a second-year engineering curriculum', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Nagel J.K.', afid='60029747;60005658', affilname='University of Georgia;James Madison University', affiliation_city='Athens;Harrisonburg', affiliation_country='United States;United States', author_count='6', author_names='Nagel, Jacquelyn Kay;Rose, Christopher Stewart;Pidaparti, Ramana M.;Tafoya, Elizabeth Marie;Pittman, Peyton Leigh;Knaster, Wade', author_ids='36706147600;7402339053;7005705093;57214452865;57194206378;57214449999', author_afids='60005658;60005658;60029747;60005658;;60005658', coverDate='2019-06-15', coverDisplayDate='15 June 2019', publicationName='ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings', issn=None, source_id='21100797240', eIssn='21535965', aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description=\"The engineer of 2020 is expected to not only offer technical ingenuity but also adapt to a continuously evolving environment while being able to operate outside the narrow limits of one discipline and be ethically grounded in solving the complex problems of the future. To build the competencies of the future engineer, undergraduate education must train students to not only solve engineering challenges that transcend disciplinary boundaries, but also communicate, transfer knowledge, and collaborate across technical and non-technical boundaries. One approach to train engineers in these competencies is teaching biomimicry or bio-inspired design in an engineering curriculum. Our research addresses the gap in resources for effectively teaching engineering students how to perform bio-inspired design by creating instructional resources based on Concept-Knowledge (C-K) design theory. C-K theory is known for integrating multiple domains of information and facilitating innovation through connection building. We used this theory to create lectures, in-class activities, assignments, rubrics and templates that scaffold the discovery and knowledge transfer processes involved in using natural designs to inspire engineering solutions. To assess the learning impact of our C-K theory instructional resources, we conducted a statistical comparison of student projects produced in a second-year engineering class exercise using instructional resources from C-K design theory and from the popular Biomimicry Institute (BI) design lens approach. A total of 105 students consented to participate; 2 course sections (N=51) used the C-K approach and 3 course sections (N=54) used the BI approach. Scores assigned to the students' concepts were used to test whether the C-K approach resulted in higher quality design concepts. The sections using the C-K approach were found to generate concepts that more closely resembled biological inspiration, meaning that they demonstrated innovating from nature rather than simply copying from nature. They were also more successful in abstracting biological system principles to create high quality concepts. Sections using the BI approach generated concepts that more closely resembled biological imitation, meaning that they tended to fixate on observable features and produced concepts that look or act exactly like the biological systems. These findings provide conclusive evidence of learning impact and support design theory based bio-inspired design pedagogy.\", authkeywords=None, citedby_count=6, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='NSF', fund_no='1504612', fund_sponsor='National Science Foundation'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85078743629', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='The diversified implementation path of China\\'s \"New Engineering \" construction and the university\\'s choice of paths', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Wei L.', afid='60003970', affilname='Zhejiang University', affiliation_city='Hangzhou', affiliation_country='China', author_count='2', author_names='Wei, Lina;Zhang, Wei', author_ids='57211212195;59064315900', author_afids='60003970;60003970', coverDate='2019-06-15', coverDisplayDate='15 June 2019', publicationName='ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings', issn=None, source_id='21100797240', eIssn='21535965', aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description='Background Emerging Engineering Education (3E) is a reform direction of engineering education based on the new needs of China\\'s strategic development and the new situation of international competition. Compared with traditional engineering, new engineering generally refers to an emerging field of engineering, which is newly born and has not yet formed a complex of relatively mature engineering education concept, disciplinary structure, talent cultivation model, teaching quality standard, organizational operation mechanism and supportive service system. At present, Chinese colleges and universities actively promote the pilot reform of new engineering majors. 612 projects from universities across the country have been recognized as the first batch of \"New Engineering\" research and practice projects by the Ministry of Education, indicating that the construction of new engineering in universities has entered the implementation stage. Purpose/Hypothesis This study in-depth interviews with 15 typical \"New Engineering\" universities, aiming to extract the implementation path of \"new engineering\" in China, and provide a useful reference for the development of \"new engineering .\" Specifically, the research questions in this study are: (1) What are the core paths of China\\'s new engineering construction? (2) What is the selection model of the \"new engineering\" construction path for different types of colleges and universities? Design/Method Firstly, based on the previous literature, the theoretical model of \"new engineering\" construction was constructed. Then, through semi-structured interview method, the first-hand data of new engineering path selection in colleges and universities was obtained, and content analysis technology was applied to analyze the data in a bid to verify the theoretical model extract key factors in the construction of new engineering in colleges and universities eventually. Results Research shows that the path of discipline integration, the path of discipline derivative, the path of Exogenously industry-led, and the path of Endogenously discipline-driven have become the main paths for the construction of \"new engineering\" in colleges and universities. Moreover, the path of engineering innovation has also been fully affirmed by some universities. The nature of disciplines along with the types and characteristics of colleges and universities exerts an influence over the choice of new engineering pathways in universities, universities and colleges at local level have relatively restricted options in the path of new engineering construction. Conclusions Based on the data results, the research further explores the connection and combination model between the university\\'s main body and the new engineering construction path.(1) engineering advantaged college and universities can take advantage of technology and engineering, and give priority to the \"the exogenously industry-led\" transformation path and the \"disciplinary integration\" new path.(2) Comprehensive universities should give full play to the supporting role of basic disciplines and the advantages of cross-disciplinary integration. New engineering will be built through the path of \"discipline-derived\" and \"disciplinary integration\" .(3) Local universities and colleges should give priority to adopting the \"the exogenously industry-led\" path, construct a collaborative education system for deep cooperation between schools and enterprises, and enhance the service capabilities of region-oriented advantaged industries.', authkeywords=None, citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='NSFC', fund_no='11724047', fund_sponsor='National Natural Science Foundation of China'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85078740583', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Teaching hands-on racecar design in a summer pre-college program', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Delagrammatikas G.J.', afid=None, affilname=None, affiliation_city=None, affiliation_country=None, author_count='2', author_names='Delagrammatikas, George J.;Rodas, Estuardo', author_ids='6507465784;57214445638', author_afids=None, coverDate='2019-06-15', coverDisplayDate='15 June 2019', publicationName='ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings', issn=None, source_id='21100797240', eIssn='21535965', aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description=\"Competitive motorsports at the undergraduate level has become an increasingly popular extra- and co-curricular activity at universities throughout the world. The importance of these experiential, industry-centered projects has long been understood by serving as a true proving ground for students while giving them the upper hand with industry recruiters. Competitions sanctioned by SAE International (formerly the Society of Automotive Engineers) generally occur at the end of the school year (May/June), thereby making the summer months a critical time for student teams to reflect on their previous designs and to start proposing innovations for the subsequent season. The Formula SAE (FSAE) team at The Cooper Union in New York City has used this time to immerse high school students in this real-world activity in their college's summer STEM program. This 6-week intensive summer program is separated into two main modules. The first module focuses on teaching students the fundamentals of engineering experimentation that culminate in oral presentations detailing their findings. These experiments include the study of cantilever beams, electric motors, water pumps, flame speed vs. air-fuel ratio, and basic electronics and microcontroller exercises. After the first week of experiments, students develop a design project that is inspired by an urgent research problem the FSAE team needs to solve. During the past three years, these have included: 1) rebuilding, instrumenting and using a torsion rig to characterize the torsional rigidity of the vehicle's frame, 2) building and using a dynamic impact attenuator test rig, 3) aggressive use of carbon fiber for weight savings in the steering wheel, suspension, pedal system, impact attenuator, and body, 4) novel techniques for the design and manufacture of aerodynamic features, 5) electronic data acquisition system, or DAQ and 6) building a brake dynamometer. Weekly design 'sprints' were given by each team where they presented an update of their project to the entire class and were then critiqued on their engineering method as well as their technical communication skills. In addition to exposing the STEM fields to high school students as they explore college and career choices, this program was also a critical learning environment for the teaching assistants who mentored these students. Entry and exit surveys were used as assessment tools to gauge the efficacy of the program in providing the students with a better appreciation for the opportunities available in the STEM professions and if the program itself changed their desire about what profession they would want to explore in college.\", authkeywords=None, citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='Pinkerton Foundation'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85078737152', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Making the makers: Building hands-on skills to help humanity through first-year design', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Dickrell P.L.', afid='60013959', affilname='University of Florida', affiliation_city='Gainesville', affiliation_country='United States', author_count='2', author_names='Dickrell, Pamela L.;Virguez, Lilianny', author_ids='8205923200;57195960296', author_afids='60013959;60013959', coverDate='2019-06-15', coverDisplayDate='15 June 2019', publicationName='ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings', issn=None, source_id='21100797240', eIssn='21535965', aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description='This complete evidence-based practice paper examines structure and student feedback of a pilot offering of “Engineering Design & Society”, a new hands-on first-year course teaching human-centered design to inspire engineering students to become innovators to help humanity.

The team launched two parallel research efforts, one to ascertain what precedents and experiences with similar goals existed around the world, i.e., an international review of other doctoral programs addressing similar needs, and the second was to conduct an interest and needs assessment of a sample of high probability individuals. The findings of both studies were positive, and their key features incorporated in this paper. This paper describes the outcomes of a successful program development and approval process and the planned phasing of its implementation. The development team treated the existing program approval mechanisms, as found in most universities and states, as a stagedgate approval process. This necessitated the development of (1) a conceptual proposal, (2) a competitive analysis, (3) a detailed program plan, (4) an implementation plan, and (5) a formal proposal with supporting data as required by the state coordinating body for higher education. The program that evolved from this process was an industry-facing, distance/on-campushybrid professional doctoral program permitting extensive tailoring of the learning experiences. This enables enrollees to address a need/problem/issue specific to their enterprise while simultaneously accomplishing and advancing along on one or more of the program's key competency vectors. This paper provides an overview of the initial set of program competencies and describes their intended use for candidate assessment (both self and by program faculty). Competency components and scaffolding for building expertise as candidates progress to earn their degrees are also described. In addition to the description of the actual doctoral program, this paper will also share the support mechanisms necessary to deploy such a program in a doctoral extensive land grant university. Specifically highlighted will be the role of a dedicated business unit designed to streamline typical university bureaucracy in order to provide responsiveness and services consistent with the expectations of a competitive private sector world. Finally, this paper concludes with an overview of the program's next steps and the sharing of a set of collegial questions directed to other institutions interested in addressing similar needs.\", authkeywords=None, citedby_count=5, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85078730454', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Co-designed research agenda to foster educational innovation efforts within undergraduate engineering at HSIS', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Henderson G.', afid='60029251;60015206;60007801', affilname='University of Miami;Florida International University;The University of Texas at El Paso', affiliation_city='Coral Gables;Miami;El Paso', affiliation_country='United States;United States;United States', author_count='4', author_names='Henderson, Gemma;Kendall, Meagan R.;Basalo, Ines;Coso Strong, Alexandra', author_ids='57214447567;57189966163;57225292464;57189994011', author_afids='60029251;60007801;60029251;60015206', coverDate='2019-06-15', coverDisplayDate='15 June 2019', publicationName='ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings', issn=None, source_id='21100797240', eIssn='21535965', aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description='The responsibility to educate and empower underrepresented groups in undergraduate education often relies on the commitment of educators and the curricula they design. Without financial or institutional support, there are limited opportunities for educators from different Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) to engage in conversations about their curricula developments and share their vision for the future of engineering education. This multi-institutional research project adopted a participatory research design to recognize the existing efforts of educators and foster their curricula and scholarship ideas. A series of three workshops were conducted in 2018 by visiting educators engaged in engineering education at both two and four-year HSIs. Before, during, and after the workshop series, attendees were asked to reflect on three guiding educational philosophies: intrinsic motivation, students as empowered agents, and design thinking. Thirty-six engineering educators from thirteen HSIs from across the Southern United States participated in one of two, two-day workshops where attendees prototyped examples of how they would implement these philosophies at their home institution. Using these prototypes, participants identified the assets they already had and resources they would still need to obtain. Following a thematic analysis of these prototypes from the initial workshops, five themes were identified and prepared for dissemination at the third workshop. Ten participants from the initial workshops attended the final workshop conducted at the 2018 ASEE Annual Conference, and an additional five participants joined as general ASEE Annual Conference attendees. In the final workshop, participants engaged with the preliminary results, further reflected on their progress since the first workshop, and brainstormed research questions they believed the engineering education research community would benefit from answering. The results of this research paper are based on the perspectives of forty-one engineering educators, with a focus on qualitative analysis of questions proposed from fifteen participants at the final workshop. Five research areas emerged: Engineering curricula enhancement, Understanding our students, Faculty development relevant to HSIs, Perceptions of instructional faculty, Long-term impactful approaches. This paper therefore aims to support broader engagement in research and collaboration with and within HSIs, with a goal of increasing the representation of Latinx students in engineering.

Education research has been supported more frequently in recent decades by the analysis of social networks, which is a tool to quantify and visualize connections and structures of relationships and interactions within organizations. With this perspective, it has been possible to deepen the study of the nature and the determinants of interactions among teachers [1]. The data from a questionnaire applied to the team of participating educators was used at the beginning of the deployment of the new educational model known as the Tec21 Educational Model. The support patterns and collaborative networks of the educators are represented from the data through sociograms and descriptive social network indicators such as density, transitivity, and reciprocity in the network [2].

In this paper, we analyze the adaptation of one such intervention, the Communication Lab (Comm Lab), a peer-to-peer coaching resource for writing, presenting, and other forms of technical communication [4]. By analyzing three institutions' iterations of a Comm Lab, we argue that a balance between core pedagogical strategies and attention to client needs makes the Comm Lab model both identifiable across institutions and flexible enough to adapt to new institutional contexts. For example, the client-based model relies on using peers with disciplinary expertise to ensure quality feedback. However, the definitions of “peer” and “disciplinary expertise” become more multidisciplinary across institutions according to the student population, the director's background, and the Lab's goals. We first describe three iterations of the Comm Lab: 1) a private research university's consortium of several department-specific Comm Labs, 2) a private research university's centralized Comm Lab for their Division of Science, and 3) an undergraduate-only STEM institution's centralized Comm Lab for students using a multidisciplinary, co-curricular space. We then analyze these adaptations alongside institutional data, client population, and client feedback to articulate three considerations for adapting an educational innovation based on disciplinary and institutional needs: disciplinary breadth, scale, and institutional fit.

At present, the research on university-based entrepreneurial ecosystem mainly focuses on the concept, while the evaluation of it is still in the initial stage and relatively few. Researchers have realized that the evaluation index system of the university-based entrepreneurial ecosystem should go beyond the specific aspects of economic interests and considering the broader social and economic benefits. However, the links between the evaluation indicators in the existing research are loose, and it is difficult to fully reveal the essence of the ecosystem. And there is no test for operability and feasibility of the indicator system. This paper contributes in several ways to engineering entrepreneurship and innovation. First, the evaluation subjects in current entrepreneurial ecosystem evaluation are mainly regional entrepreneurial ecosystem, student entrepreneurial ecosystem and entrepreneurial ecosystem, and university-based entrepreneurial ecosystem is not included. Secondly, researchers often evaluate the entrepreneurial ecosystem from the internal and external environment or the composition of the ecosystem, without considering the various factors involved in the dynamic process of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. This paper makes a novel contribution by building an evaluation framework of university-based entrepreneurial ecosystem based on its essential characteristics. This paper presents the evaluation system model of university-based entrepreneurial ecosystem, establishing the evaluation indicator system with 4 first-level indicators of ecological diversity, synergistic symbiosis, network interaction and self-evolution, 14 second-level indicators and 33 three-level indicators. And it obtains the index weight on every level with applying the Analytic Hierarchy Process, finding that experts believe network interaction and self-evolution are the two most important measurements of the university-based entrepreneurial ecosystem. Based on this, this paper chooses Zhejiang University as an empirical research case to verify the evaluation index system. The evaluation results show that the overall development of the entrepreneurial ecosystem of Zhejiang University is in good condition, especially in the two aspects of network interaction and self-evolution.

In this project, which is part of a larger investigation into high performance design teams, we explored the use of graphing and other visual techniques for recording designers' perceptions of their design processes and products. Our primary aim was to introduce greater richness into the evaluation of designers' behaviors and outcomes as we posed research questions about their relationship to cognitive variables. In this paper, we will discuss two of these reflection activities-an emotional state plot and a graphical assessment of a design solution's feasibility, usefulness, and novelty-in the context of a team design challenge. While the designers under study worked as teams, each individual designer provided her/his perceptions of the team process and design solutions using these reflection activities. Our analysis of individual perceptions from seven design teams of 4-5 designers each will be reported here. This investigation also includes the cognitive style of each participant (as measured by Kirton's Adaption-Innovation inventory-KAI®) as a potential mediating variable on the individual perceptions of emotions and outcomes. This paper will provide details of the two reflection activities, our associated methods of analysis, key findings related to the designers' perceptions and cognitive styles, benefits and limitations of these two reflection activities, and implications for design educators.\", authkeywords=None, citedby_count=7, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='NSF', fund_no='1635386', fund_sponsor='National Science Foundation'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85066795692', doi='10.1007/s10796-019-09930-0', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Moving beyond Smart Cities: Digital Nations for Social Innovation & Sustainability', subtype='ed', subtypeDescription='Editorial', creator='Kar A.K.', afid='60113158;60032730;60006288', affilname='Ashoka University;Indian Institute of Technology Delhi;Delft University of Technology', affiliation_city='Sonipat;New Delhi;Delft', affiliation_country='India;India;Netherlands', author_count='5', author_names='Kar, Arpan Kumar;Ilavarasan, Vigneswara;Gupta, M.

With growing interest in cellular agriculture as a means to address public health, environmental, and animal welfare challenges of animal agriculture, the concept of producing seafood from fish cell- and tissue-cultures is emerging as an approach to address similar challenges with industrial aquaculture systems and marine capture. Cell-based seafood—as opposed to animal-based seafood—can combine developments in biomedical engineering with modern aquaculture techniques. Biomedical engineering developments such as closed-system bioreactor production of land animal cells create a basis for the large scale production of marine animal cells. Aquaculture techniques such as genetic modification and closed system aquaculture have achieved significant gains in production that can pave the way for innovations in cell-based seafood production. Here, we present the current state of innovation relevant to the development of cell-based seafood across multiple species, as well as specific opportunities and challenges that exist for advancing this science. The authors find that the physiological properties of fish cell- and tissue- culture may be uniquely suited to cultivation in vitro. These physiological properties, including tolerance to hypoxia, high buffering capacity, and low-temperature growth conditions, make marine cell culture an attractive opportunity for scaled production of cell-based seafood; perhaps even more so than mammalian and avian cell cultures for cell-based meats. This opportunity, coupled with the unique capabilities of crustacean tissue-friendly scaffolding such as chitosan, a common seafood waste product and mushroom derivative, presents promise for cell-based seafood production via bioreactor cultivation. To become fully realized, cell-based seafood research will require more understanding of fish muscle cell and tissue cultivation; more investigation into serum-free media formulations optimized for fish cell culture; and bioreactor designs tuned to the needs of fish cells for large scale production.', authkeywords='aquaculture | bioreactor | cell-based seafood | cellular agriculture | fish tissue culture | marine cell culture | ocean conservation | serum-free media', citedby_count=80, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85067795866', doi='10.1088/1755-1315/267/5/052053', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Study the Status and Path of Reform of Innovation and Entrepreneurship of Civil Engineering Education System', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Zhu G.X.', afid='60108804;122737629;106685681', affilname='Baicheng Normal University;Baicheng Haiming Primary School;Taishan Polytechnic', affiliation_city=\"Baicheng;Baicheng;Tai'an\", affiliation_country='China;China;China', author_count='3', author_names='Zhu, Guang Xing;Hong-Jie, M.

The connection between universities and companies, aligned to active methodologies for teaching and learning meets a global need within a corporate universe to get faster and simpler and make the team see the project in a more holistic and complete manner. However, the goal is to bridge the gap with pro-fessors, researchers, makers, start-ups, and companies who want to use business-to-busi-ness practices. It can be said that these are beneficial characteristics of a makerspace observed: (i) students’ learning is more active, (ii) more interaction between students and professors, through different areas (iii) at an early stage, students get in contact with the professional reality of their field, as the projects are related to real Engineering problems, and (iv) students develop transversal skills. Practical implications: This paper identifies the potential that Makerspaces offer as a strategic approach to teaching and learning related to the fourth industrial era. This paper implies that universities and academics that wish to tailor their education to industry 4.0 need understand this model better, and where appropriate invest in educational infra-structures such as this in universities, companies or cities. This will ensure that universities are educating professionals with the most suitable skills for industry and society, generat-ing innovation in creative teaching and learning spaces.

Design/Methodology/Approach: The research was structured as an exploratory research and was conducted by means of a focus group comprised of representatives from Porto Alegre (RS) working directly with higher education and/or playing key roles within the city’s innovation ecosystem. The group’s discussion was analyzed along with current literature on the topic. Results: The paper provides insightful perceptions of the obstacles faced by faculty mem-bers when attempting to develop innovative methodologies within classes so that potential partnerships are fostered by agents of the innovation ecosystem in order to better prepare professionals that will later be inserted in this new innovative scenario. Limitations of the investigation: The present study is structured as an exploratory research based on a focus group discussion and analysis. Thus, as any qualitative approach, it might lack generalizability, once its purpose is to investigate a specific phenomenon and promote further investigation on the issue. However, all discussion from the focus group was analyzed and supported by extant literature on the topic, in order to mitigate such limitation and strengthen the research relevance. Practical implications: The analysis and discussion obtained from both the focus group and literature are imperative on the need of critical changes on universities’ organizational culture to support entrepreneurial activities, as well as fostering partnerships with key agents within innovation ecosystems to better prepare professionals to the new market setting. Originality/value: Although some studies investigate the relationship involving universities and Science and Technology Parks, few studies explore how engineering schools’ curricula can benefit from such alliances.

Our analysis of the issues then draws on major policy reports of the use of technology in education and the extant research literature from engineering education and science education as well as technology studies and science studies. Discussion of each of these issues leads to a summary set of recommendations.

Combining the experience of testing and research on connected and autonomous vehicle test-sites at Chang'an University, this paper proposes a modular flexible test bed for an intelligent and connected transportation system. The modular flexible test bed included an application layer, a sensing and releasing layer, a network link layer, and a management service layer. The application layer simulated a real-world intelligent connected environment. The adaption of devices and services in different environments for intelligent connected transportation can be verified by simulating various aspects of weather, roads, and traffic conditions. The sensing and releasing layer collected information of the environment and traffic system and released control and service information, through sensing devices including a camera, light detection and ranging (lidar) device, and millimeter-wave radar, and releasing devices including a variable information board. The network link layer consisted of a heterogeneous vehicular network. Through collaboration among networks, the network link layer could provide transparent transmission and exclusive network information services for devices and services in the application and sensing and releasing layers. The management service layer managed storage, backup, processing, and visualization of the lower layers' data, and implemented the management and maintenance of the lower layers' test devices. Based on the modular test bed mentioned above, an in-door test bench for an intelligent and connected vehicle was developed to cooperate with the test bed for simulating, recreating, and adjusting a traffic scene, so as to realize a flexible intelligent and connected transportation test. The modular flexible test bed for an intelligent and connected transportation system proposed in this paper has a standardized test environment and uses a controllable and traceable test process and scientific test evaluation method. It can verify intelligent and connected devices and services on functionality, application processing, application effects, and service utility, in different dimensions. The construction, promotion, and application of the modular flexible test bed for intelligent and connected transportation systems can promote the transformation of intelligent and connected technology from theoretical research to practical application and will play a crucial role in achieving innovation and reform of future transportation information services and transportation systems.\", authkeywords='Automotive engineering | Heterogeneous network | Intelligent and connected transportation | Intelligent transportation system | Unmanned driving | Vehicular network', citedby_count=4, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85071671413', doi='10.1109/WETICE.2019.00023', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Evaluating Technology Innovation for E-Mobility', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Aversa R.', afid='60108713;60108239;60026777', affilname='Eurecat, Technology Centre of Catalonia;SINTEF Digital;Università degli Studi della Campania Luigi Vanvitelli', affiliation_city='Barcelona;Trondheim;Naples', affiliation_country='Spain;Norway;Italy', author_count='6', author_names='Aversa, Rocco;Di Martino, Beniamino;Venticinque, Salvatore;Natvig, Marit;Jiang, Shanshan;Sard, Regina Enrich', author_ids='6602529490;7003351260;9276299200;6507294586;8976142600;42961261000', author_afids='60026777;60026777;60026777;60108239;60108239;60108713', coverDate='2019-06-01', coverDisplayDate='June 2019', publicationName='Proceedings - 2019 IEEE 28th International Conference on Enabling Technologies: Infrastructure for Collaborative Enterprises, WETICE 2019', issn=None, source_id='21100927191', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number='8795394', pageRange='76-81', description='GreenCharge is an European research project that aims at integrating and deploying innovative technologies and associated business models to facilitate the transition towards electro mobility (e-mobility).

Scoping phase has been found to consist of strategic policies definition and ecosystem strategic analysis activities. Planning phase activities include ecosystem design, ecosystem preparedness, recruiting actors and providing physical infrastructure. Functioning activities for co-creation can be coordinated by a strategy with five stages namely product development, product manufacturing, market formation management, value appropriation and feedback generation. This paper outlines a framework that can be used by innovation ecosystem facilitators to evaluate their platforms and develop management tools for their specific contexts.', authkeywords='innovation ecosystem | innovation platforms | value co-creation', citedby_count=11, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='GSK', fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='GlaxoSmithKline'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85071514116', doi='10.1109/ICE.2019.8792581', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Innovation Maturity Model for New Product and Services Development: A proposal', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Mattei G.', afid='60101870', affilname='Scuola Universitaria Professionale della Svizzera Italiana', affiliation_city='Manno', affiliation_country='Switzerland', author_count='5', author_names='Mattei, Gianpiero;Canetta, Luca;Sorlini, Marzio;Alberton, Siegfried;Tito, Federica', author_ids='55433612700;55900331200;36183730100;57210800414;57210800814', author_afids='60101870;60101870;60101870;60101870;60101870', coverDate='2019-06-01', coverDisplayDate='June 2019', publicationName='Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2019', issn=None, source_id='21100926507', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number='8792581', pageRange=None, description='Innovation is currently identified as the main source of competitive advantage and it is essential for a company to be able to manage and recognize innovative processes.

From the perspective of national innovation system, it is the key sub-system in which various innovation activities are triggered by profit maximization motives. Currently, in South Korea, the research and development (RD) investment in private sector accounts for about 75% of the national RD investment. Considering the increasing role of the private sector in the national innovation system, it is essential for policy makers to make innovation activities in each domain to be complementary with each other. From the perspective of the national innovation system the primary objective of this study is to develop the innovation scoreboard that enables us to monitor the status of the innovation activities in private sector. Furthermore, we seek to ensure the comparability of all indicators so that we can easily identify one nation's area of relative strength and comparative advantage.The private sector innovation scoreboard is composed of four sub-categories: Innovation infrastructure, institutions, innovation activities and impact. The innovation activities are divided further onto knowledge activities, organizational activities and innovation output. By doing so, the part of innovation activities model the sequential process of input-output flow of innovation. In total, 60 indicators are included in the private innovation scoreboard.Among the 60 indicators, South Korea has relative strength in science and technology human resources, market size, private RD support system, start-up system, and the number of start-ups. However, it shows relative weakness in indicators such as financial infrastructure, legal system for promoting science and technology, financial system, labor market efficiency, regulation and output. Scores on science and technology manpower, start-ups, and input into knowledge activities, which can be regarded as input, were relatively good. However, the output and impact sectors of innovation, which can be considered as performance areas, seem relatively vulnerable. Compared to input, the causes of low performance can be explained with lack of financial infrastructure, financial and scientific technology promotion system, and industry-academic cooperation.By creating a private innovation scoreboard this study contributes to the understanding of current status of overall private sector innovation system in Korea. Therefore, we can compare the current South Korea system with that of advanced countries and identify its strengths and weaknesses. As a result, we can contribute to the development of strategic policymaking, such as the supplementation of relatively vulnerable areas.\", authkeywords='national innovation system | private innovation scoreboard | RD policy | ST indicators', citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85071512370', doi='10.1109/ICE.2019.8792605', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Comparative Analysis of Innovation Capability: Examining Across Career Strata and Gender using Item Response Theory Approach.', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Bathia S.', afid='60121391', affilname='UC Berkeley’s Industrial Engineering and Operations Research Department', affiliation_city='Berkeley', affiliation_country='United States', author_count='5', author_names='Bathia, Shruti;Castro-Hernandez, Elias;Goyal, Mudit;Ojala, Alexander Fred;Sidhu, Ikhlaq', author_ids='57210311486;57210804956;57203641981;57203280085;57213359442', author_afids='60121391;60121391;60121391;60121391;60121391', coverDate='2019-06-01', coverDisplayDate='June 2019', publicationName='Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2019', issn=None, source_id='21100926507', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number='8792605', pageRange=None, description='In view of increasing diversity in all sectors, and the growing connectivity and liberalization of most global economies, this paper seeks to analyze the effects on innovation as a firm transitions from predominantly male to a more equal distribution of genders across the main sectors of responsibility in an enterprise.

However, the success criteria are changing increasingly. Not only the price, quality and functionality are key factors, rather the prerequisites for future business models are increasingly being created by providing accompanying services and novel possibilities for product enhancement. Strictly speaking, engineering has to prepare the basics for such business models.In a forecast study on behalf of the German Ministry of Economics the authors asked for trends, opportunities and challenges in future engineering. Based on literature analysis and expert interviews success factors and upcoming trends were identified. Collaborative work was identified as a key element in future engineering. Collaboration currently exists widely in the field of research and development, i.e. in the more pre-competitive field. This is often described by the keyword open innovation. The model of collaboration is aligned with equality. Regional innovation clusters provide e.g. such an ecosystem geared towards equality and long-term strategic cooperation, which has proven economically successful in recent decades. Bringing all these methodologies together - engineering accompanying the whole life cycle, collaboration along the value-added chain, and new information-driven business models - this results in a new culture of cross-company collaborative engineering as a key enabler.It turned out that it is still too early for a detailed strategic roadmap for the concrete implementation of cross-company collaborative engineering. Nevertheless, the status quo and foreseeable steps to create the precondition for successful cross-company collaborative engineering can be well described. Thus, the extended digital twin becomes the key element of success for the widespread use of cross-company collaborative engineering.

The research promotes greater access to healthcare innovations in attempts to encourage health equity and to improve the performance of countries' health systems.\", authkeywords='Health system | health technology management | health technology transfer | implementation science | innovation system', citedby_count=3, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85071490671', doi='10.1109/ICE.2019.8792646', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='On the Extension of Digital Ecosystems for SCM and Customs with Distributed Ledger Technologies : Requirements Anlysis, Innovation Assessment, and Prototype Design for the Lake Constance Region', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Dobler M.', afid='60121722;60025858;60005578', affilname='Universität Liechtenstein;ETH Zürich;FHV - Vorarlberg University of Applied Sciences', affiliation_city='Vaduz;Zurich;Dornbirn', affiliation_country='Liechtenstein;Switzerland;Austria', author_count='3', author_names='Dobler, Martin;Ballandies, Mark;Holzwarth, Valentin', author_ids='35239486100;57192554814;57210803127', author_afids='60005578;60025858;60121722', coverDate='2019-06-01', coverDisplayDate='June 2019', publicationName='Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2019', issn=None, source_id='21100926507', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number='8792646', pageRange=None, description='Global supply chains represent the backbone of the modern manufacturing industry. Planning of global supply chains still represents a major hurdle, mainly because of the high complexity and unforeseen disruptions that have to be mastered for meeting the different logistics windows in a globally distributed production environment. Trust in supply chains is an additional challenge. A major - albeit sometimes overlooked - part of Supply Chain Management (SCM) is the management and integration of customs processes, clearing of tariffs, (re-)billing of customers, and fulfilling other legal requirements related to crossing borders, ranging from environmental standards over goods inspection to general paper work. With the exception of work offered by the World Customs Organization (WCO) the issue of customs and blockchain is still underrepresented in research and practice. In this paper, we look at innovations that drive the current ICT-enabled SCM research and how these can be combined with smart customs management. After a literature review and introduction to the state-of- The-art, we list potential trust-based innovations for SCM and customs in digital business ecosystems. Based upon the innovations we also describe a requirements analysis of existing distributed ledger technologies (requirements for system layout, system configuration, system governance).

In this paper, the authors attempt to analyze the changing conditions of the current technology management processes associated with the accelerating dynamics of organizational transformations, strengthening boundaries of cross-disciplinary technologies application and generally increased the speed of the advanced technologies development. Such drastic changes obviously affect the way and manner of the modern management processes implementation. Nowadays each company - to a more or less extent - is a technology-driven organization. Digitization, cyber-physical systems and artificial intelligence are the key drivers for the changing business circumstances. Consequently, management and technology today are so intertwined that without a holistic and conceptual understanding of the core principles of this interdisciplinary tandem it is just not possible to be at the crest of the 'business success wave'. Overall, the socio-economical effect of the increasingly complex technologies obviously requires new forms of management and leadership so as new - appropriate and workable in the actual conditions - management tools. In terms of the technology executives' professional functionality, it is important also to pay attention to the 'back effect' of the aforementioned technological impact. On the one hand, technology executives are increasingly appointed as members of the top management team (TMT). But on the other hand, it means that they should be understood by specialists from different non-directly related to technologies areas (i.e. financiers, strategists, business process managers, etc.). In other words, in order to bring the technological perspective in the general management process and further have a sustainable managerial impact on the internal and external stakeholders, technology executives should also be leaders with abilities to recognize how applied technologies are perceived from other perspectives of organizational functioning. In this context, modern technology executives should perform the role of 'boundary spanners' by means of establishing informational and managerial links among different groups and persons at the intra- and extra-organizational levels. Thus, integrating different facets of technology perception from the core stakeholders and directly or indirectly maintaining coordination of their activities, technology executives could increasingly act as agents of organizational change and innovations promotion.\", authkeywords='closed-open and focused-social innovations | CTO | expeditionary leadership | Hidden CTO | organizational innovations | primary team leadership | RD generations | Technology management', citedby_count=2, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85071473544', doi='10.1109/ICE.2019.8792585', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Patterns of Digitization - What differentiates digitally mature organizations?', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Gudergan G.', afid='60116849;60016653;123087272', affilname='Poole College of Management;Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen;VP/GM Analytics Practice', affiliation_city='Raleigh;Aachen;Durham', affiliation_country='United States;Germany;United States', author_count='6', author_names='Gudergan, Gerhard;Mugge, Paul;Kwiatkowski, Alexander;Abbu, Haroon;Michaelis, Timothy L.;Krechting, Denis', author_ids='44861204900;15078100500;57210789221;57209534488;56592445300;56786526600', author_afids='60016653;60116849;60016653;123087272;60016653;60016653', coverDate='2019-06-01', coverDisplayDate='June 2019', publicationName='Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2019', issn=None, source_id='21100926507', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number='8792585', pageRange=None, description=\"This article describes the results of a survey designed to assess how companies are implementing digital transformation, including the various strategies they employ and the actions they take to achieve large-scale transformations.

CE is a promising managerial tool that offers a wide range of options to pursue the creation of new businesses and to support the companies' transformation in order to adapt to changes in the environment.

On the basis of the relevant assumptions, we construct the dynamic models under decentralized decision-making without cost-sharing, decentralized decision-making with cost-sharing and centralized decision-making respectively, and respectively obtain their optimal feedback equilibrium strategies, low-carbon technology stock and the optimal trajectory of profit value function over time. By comparing the three feedback equilibrium strategies, through the extent of Pareto improvement of both the cost-sharing mechanism and cooperative innovation mechanism to the main emission reduction interests, it is found that in the case of centralized decision-making, the more the efforts of low-carbon technological innovation (sharing) in local regions and external regions are endeavored, the higher the overall emission reduction interests than those of non-cooperation to achieve the Pareto optimality. The cost-sharing mechanism can improve the efforts of all subjects and improve the emission reduction interests moderately.

Research and development of efficient, green and reasonable utilization of major characteristic resources are the keys to realizing the sustainable development of resources and environment. Cleaner production is the best pattern of pollution preventing and the only way to achieve sustainable development and recycling economy. The sub-molten salt media clean chemical metallurgical generic technology created by Professor Yi Zhang, academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE), has realized the efficient clean conversion and separation of refractory amphoteric metal minerals with chemical commonality (including Al, Cr, V, Ti, Mn, Nb, Ta, etc.). Reactive oxygen species have been considered as the key factor to realize the efficient conversion of amphoteric metal mineral resources. The sub-molten salt media chemical system with the reactive oxygen species tuning as the core technology was established. The reactive oxygen species tuning strategy in the sub-molten salt media is summarized into five methods, including chemical field enhancement, flow field enhancement, pressure field enhancement, additive enhancement, and microbubble enhancement. All the above methods can be applied to strengthen the decomposition of amphoteric metal mineral resources and decrease the reaction conditions. Till now, the sub-molten salt technology has been successfully applied to the treatment of vanadium titano-magnetite, chromite, diasporic bauxite, tantalum-niobium ores, and high-alumina fly ash. Furthermore, as a feasible, efficient, easy operation and environment-friendly method, electrochemistry plays a vital role in various fields including metallurgy, chemical engineering, and catalysis.

Innovative changes should not be parameterized solely by economic efficiency or performance. With regard to new knowledge and technology development, their ethical aspects become more important and focus more on good life. In the context of social sciences with interdisciplinary trends, applied ethics and its subdisciplines (professional ethics, business ethics, ethics of science and research) can take over and play an important practical role.

The results are as follows: First, SFA supplies efficient estimation for GTFP growth information. The 36 industrial sectors are classified into three emission types, that is, high-, moderate-, and low emission. Second, GTFP growth differs significantly in three types of sectors. With kernel density results for 36 sectors, the curve of GTFP growth has shifted upward and toward the left since 2010. For high-emission type sectors, their kernel curve has also moved upward and toward the left. The curve of moderate-emission type sectors significantly shifted toward the left, whereas the curve of low-emission type moved upward. Third, based on regression estimation results, environmental regulatory policy, resource input structure, foreign direct investment, and energy-type structure significantly influence GTFP growth. Technology innovation makes insignificant impact on GTFP for industrial sectors. In conclusion, sectorial heterogeneity should be paid more focus in order to improve their growth, especially for high-emission type sectors.

Handheld neurosurgical instruments are integral components of these procedures. However, these instruments have many limitations, such as poor ergonomics, constrained maneuverability, and limited degrees of freedom. A need for developing better instruments is commonly felt by neurosurgeons. Also, the focus of modern neurosurgical training is shifting toward simulation models. The baseline data of surgical instruments play a vital role in the development of virtual and physical simulators. A primary factor impeding development of novel instruments and simulators is lack of a comprehensive surgical instrument database. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a virtual repository of microscopic and neuroendoscopic instruments. Methods: Standard neurosurgical instrument sets were scanned, reverse engineered, and stored in various file formats at the file transfer protocol server. The developed database was validated by 4 groups of experts by creating different neurosurgery applications.

This research focuses on the imaginaries of pioneering and prospective adopters of EVs in business organizations in Milton Keynes. The imaginaries of organizational buyers and fleet managers subtly shaped their exploration of early-market vehicles as they articulated the demands, barriers and motivations of users within their firm. This research draws on a thematic analysis of interviews with business and governmental actors, policy documents and trade literature discussing the early-market adoption of EVs by business organizations. The results identify the processes through which business adopters make sense of the new technology as well as the policies and organizations that supported their learning process. In addition to technical concerns, key aspects concerned patterns of use and demand, fitness for operations, and new business and operational models suited to the characteristics of EVs. Thus, it is concluded that the imaginaries of business adopters and of the organizations supporting them increasingly envision adopters not just as rational optimizers but also as complex problem solvers working out new ways to embed EVs in innovative, competitive configurations that work for them.', authkeywords=None, citedby_count=13, openaccess=0, freetoread='repositoryam', freetoreadLabel='Green', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85047620190', doi='10.1016/j.technovation.2018.05.001', pii='S0166497217305837', pubmed_id=None, title='Crowdfunding technological innovations: Interaction between consumer benefits and rewards', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Zhang H.', afid='60022904', affilname='New Jersey Institute of Technology', affiliation_city='Newark', affiliation_country='United States', author_count='2', author_names='Zhang, Haisu;Chen, Weizhi', author_ids='56589320900;57202256395', author_afids='60022904;60022904', coverDate='2019-06-01', coverDisplayDate='June - July 2019', publicationName='Technovation', issn='01664972', source_id='14726', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='84-85', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='11-20', description='This research aims to examine how consumer benefits stated in the project title and the number of rewards in the crowdfunding context interactively impact the number of backers and funding success for technological innovations.

A representative sample of product innovative SMEs drawn from two waves of the Community Innovation Survey between 2008 and 2012 reveals that a strong R&D capacity at city-agglomeration level favours private external information sources for innovation, but has no influence on the likelihood to rely on public sources for innovation. Accordance between specialization of the private R&D knowledge base and the SME’s activities positively influences the use of clients as information sources for innovation, whereas under these circumstances supplier responsiveness turns out to be less frequently solicited for.

These barriers take a number of forms including financial, knowledge based or attitudinal. The aims of this project were to assess the current music technology provision in SEN schools within a particular part of the Dorset region, UK, determine the barriers they were facing and develop strategies to help the schools overcome these barriers. An overriding concern for this project was to leave the schools with lasting benefit and meaningful change. As such an Action Research [4] methodology was followed, which has at its heart an understanding of the participants as co-researchers helping ensure any solutions presented met the needs of the stakeholders. The presumption by the researchers was that the schools needed new technology to help overcome barriers. However, although technological solutions to problems were presented to the school, it was found that the main issues were around the flexibility of equipment to be used in different locations, staff time and staff attitudes to technology.

Firms materialize the objectives of eco-innovation from a reactive attitude to external pressures, to a more proactive attitude that implies the voluntary incorporation of eco-innovation activities. This variability in the behaviour of companies with respect to the level of eco-innovation development has been a motivator for the research. However, despite the importance of this research question, this has been approached in a dispersed way from multiple approaches. From a dynamic capabilities perspective, we assume that the innovation capacity of the firm encourages eco-innovations. Our paper is focused on the process of eco-innovation, identifying the elements that facilitate or hinder the eco-innovation in the firm. We study the Spanish case, using a panel from the Spanish Innovation Survey, with a sample of 5461 Spanish firms. The results highlight that the complexity of the eco-innovation process negatively affects the decision to develop eco-innovations.

Thus, qualified PhD students play a pivotal role in this process. Moreover, the nuclear energy industry encounters ceaseless real-world state-of-the-art problems, and academic researches generally feed on them that would finally become the PhD students' theses and dissertations. Therefore, the paradigm for intimate university-industry partnership is required. The university-industry collaboration system provides an effective approach to cultivating high-level talents for the nuclear energy industry. Since 1996, Tsinghua University (THU) has cooperated with companies such as China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) to enroll 60 students orientated to the nuclear energy industry every year, approximately10%-15% of which would subsequently pursue doctoral degrees. This paper will illustrate, build, optimize and investigate the training mode for PhD students majoring in the nuclear science and engineering based on the university-industry collaboration system in THU.

Widely used in-house for the expertise and the maintenance of power plants and electrical networks, code_aster is a unique product which fulfills two main objectives: - an efficient software for engineering studies with quality assurance requirements; - Dissemination within EDF of its research work in various computational mechanics fields. Since 2001, code_aster is distributed as a free software (i.e. GNU general public license - no commercial licensing of the code by EDF). Since justifying quality labels is required by the nuclear industry, most of the functionalities of the software have been validated by thorough independent comparisons with analytical or experimental results and benchmarks towards other codes. Code_aster is integrated today in the Salomé-Meca platform, which also includes 3D modeling, meshing and post-processing modules. As an expertise code, it includes very recent and exploratory methods and at the same time offers the flexibility to the user to adjust a number of parameters to accommodate for any new innovation in a given field.

Benefited from its nature as an electricity-driven capacitor, the electrocaloric working body renders the great advantages in the energy efficiency and the device integration. The decade-long efforts on advancing the technology revealed many promising material candidates with matured manufacturing protocols, as well as intriguing device prototypes for applications beyond the traditional vapor compression based cooling. This article presents the recent advances in electrocaloric cooling technologies, from material improvements to device demonstrations. The environmental impact and the energy efficiency of the technology were evaluated by the total effective warming impact and the material COP, respectively. In addition to the current progresses achieved by the decade-long research effort, the existing challenges and potential opportunities brought by the electrocaloric refrigeration will be discussed. In general, applying or removing an external work to a refrigerant can cause a reversible phase transition with heat ejection or absorption. Various thermodynamic cycles based on the liquid-gaseous phase transition are where the foundation of conventional vapor compression refrigeration (VCR) was built on. Analogous to the VCR, the electrocaloric refrigeration (ECR) utilizes an electric field to induce a dipolar order-disorder phase transition where a reversible temperature change enables the heat pumping. The discovery of the giant electrocaloric effect (ECE) in solid-state materials a decade ago quickly revived the interests on the ECR from both academia and industrial. Numerous advances have been achieved in condensed matter physics, from normal FE to relaxor FE and from solid-state dielectrics to fluidic dielectrics. The ECE-induced temperature changes exceeded 30 K under high external electric fields. The ECR is environmentally benign. Operating a solid-state or condensed matter cooling agent, ECR emits no harmful gas directly, such as gases with ozone depletion potential (ODP) and/or global warming potential (GWP). The electrocaloric (EC) materials hold the promise of high energy efficiency because of their nature as low-loss insulators. Overall, our review shows that the ECR exhibits an incredibly low total equivalent warming impact (TEWI), with both direct and indirect equivalent CO2 emission considered. EC cooling devices have been demonstrated by researchers in university research groups as well as in R&D centers of industrial cooperation that are pioneering in the field. The uniqueness of the EC working bodies, i.e., compressor-free, low-noise, high-efficiency, flexibility, scalability, optic transparency, electromechanical maneuverability, etc., may extend the ECR to new application scenarios beyond the traditional household refrigeration and air conditioners. Future advances of the ECR could lead to point-of-care, distributive thermal management, on-chip cooling, wearable thermal management, and highly efficient climate-controlling systems for electric vehicles. The development of this interdisciplinary field calls for in-depth collaboration among research societies of condensed matter physics, material engineering, mechanical and thermal engineering, refrigeration and cryogenics, and industrial manufacturing. The global climate shift calls for a series of technical innovations that exhibit low-carbon-emission over their lifetimes. The discovery of the giant electrocaloric effect (ECE) stimulated a new research field of the environmental-benign, high-efficiency cooling technology, which extends the boundary of the conventional refrigeration as well as the condensed matter physics. In this review, we summarize the major advances of the ECE in the fundamental physics, materials, devices demos, and the state of arts over the last decade.

In this context, Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools for design and fabrication like simulation, synthesis, testing etc. are essential. After design entry and behavioral simulation, the synthesis tool is used to convert the behavioral level description into gate level description. The synthesized circuit can be later on used for functional and timing verification, test development and further layout level synthesis. Even though, few QCA synthesis methods are available in the literature, there is lack of simple QCA synthesis method which uses commonly available CMOS based EDA tools as far as possible and hence, less costly. Therefore, in this paper, a simple but novel synthesis method for combinational QCA circuit “QSynthesizer” is proposed. The authors do neither claim an optimized method of synthesis nor a very high level of research in the field of QCA synthesis tool development. Still, this paper definitely contains a frugal innovation for synthesizing QCA circuit in absence of rarely available, low cost QCA synthesizers. The proposed synthesis method comprises logic reduction algorithm implemented in C++, Perl scripts and widely used synthesis tools like Leonardo Spectrum for digital design.

In each case, the inversion was constrained using available geological and physical property constraints. Analysis of magnetic susceptibility data suggests that the observed aeromagnetic anomaly pattern includes effects associated with boundaries between lithological units and fault zone alteration resulting from removal of magnetite. Susceptibility contrast associated with alteration is greater than that associated with changes in lithology. The inversions seek to define the three-dimensional geometry of geological boundaries and the fractures are treated as high-frequency noise.

Findings indicate that increased creative infrastructural actions are reflected in these actors’ resourcefulness for mobilizing information, materials, and equipment, and for making creative artifacts through new technologies weaved within traditional practices. We propose two novel approaches to design in this craft-based infrastructure. First, we explore designing for the social layer of infrastructure and its mutually advantageous exploitative relationships rooted in culture and traditions. Second, we suggest designing for roaming value-creation artifacts, which blend physical and digital materializations of songket textile design.

The Common clock means that the common crystal oscillator of the GNSS dual receiver sends the same pulse signal simultaneously. The GNSS dual receiver can realize to acquire data synchronously from the different antennas. One benefit of using a common clock reference is that the clock error is the same for all RF signals including carrier phase measurements, and thus it can be removed by forming single differences. It is obvious that the single difference can be optimized and the accuracy of attitude determination can be further improved. So, the common-clock is adopted in more than two GNSS receivers and the carrier phase single difference can get the same technical effects as the double difference.

To identify software engineering aspects of blockchain in smart grids and supply chain management, we start upon online libraries focusing on engineering and information technology, and we opted for the methodology of systematic mapping studies in software engineering. The search strategy identified 535 papers, of which 60 were identified as main studies for our mapping. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no previous similar studies exist. Results of the study show that the research connecting blockchain technology to smart grids and supply chain management systems is still young. None of the techniques or systems have yet been implemented in a real life setting. As such, more work has to be done before we can look at the actual implications of putting such technologies into use. Software engineering practices could prove to be very useful in the process of development.

We foresee increasing costs for data collection and maintenance, leading to the risk of development budgets eaten up by commodity features, thus leaving little resources for differentiation and innovation.

In contrast to Open Data (OD), which e.g., governmental agencies provide to catalyze innovation, OCD is shared in open collaboration between commercial organizations, similar to OSS. To achieve this, there is a need for technical infrastructure (e.g., tools for version and access control), licence models, and governance models, all of which have to be tailored for data. However, as data may be sensitive for privacy, anonymization and obfuscation of data is also a research challenge.

Indian agricultural machinery manufacturing sector is quite challenging which consists of countryside farmers, traditional small units, common craftsmen and small scale companies. They are the unorganised manufacturers, who are lacking proper infrastructure, business model and technology intervention. Hence this research has been conducted to identify and analyse the factors influencing the sustainability of Agri Engineering Manufacturing Companies. In this study quantitative research has been carried out. Agri Engineering Manufacturing Companies (AEMC) of the state of Karnataka has been considered as the study population. A total number of 372 AEMC spread across various districts of Karnataka have been identified to conduct the research. Initially the critical factors influencing the Business Sustainability of AEMC have been identified through Pilot Study. Further the variables influencing the Business Sustainability factors have been identified by reviewing scholarly journal articles and feedback collected from the Entrepreneurs of AEMC. The final Survey Questionnaire has been developed and validated by the Focus Group Discussion consisting of the panel members from academic background and Industry experts. Primary data has been collected through telephonic interview, Google Spread sheet and personal interview from the identified AEMC with the help of final Survey Questionnaire. A total number of 354 valid responses were received out of 372 AEMC, thus achieving 95% of response rate.

Various kinds of innovations have been found in making earthquake dampers which are attached to the building structure. This innovation is one of passive control systems that modify the mass and stiffness as well as by adding damping materials to control the dynamic response of the structure due to the influence of lateral forces, one of which is the seismic force. This study focuses on a passive control device that can be added to the structure, which is a composition of rubber layers and steel plates with graded sand as the centre filler. Several previous studies have proved that the rubber has the ability to reduce vibration because of its elasticity. While the sand as choice for additive material based on a grain of sand forms a uniform that cause internal friction between the sand and can produce damping. Research conducted on a passive control device without graded sand as the centre filler and a passive control device with graded sand as the centre filler by using the half power bandwidth method to produce a damping ratio value (ξ).

Management sciences proved to be an essential area of study. The most important institution contributing to the field is the Dutch Utrecht University. “The Journal of Cleaner Production” should be considered as the most focused journal on this kind of research.

Our research group introduces the international advanced integrated design strategy and method in view of the key technology of “reverse osmosis and membrane distillation integration” which is expected to suitable for the concentrated demand of Chinese medicine pharmaceutical industry. Taking the representative Chinese herbal compound prescription as the experimental system, a three-dimensional model of \"time-material rheological characteristics-membrane mass transfer process\" was established by using rheological theory and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) as experimental system and dynamic and precise analysis of technological process. The rheological law of traditional Chinese medicine materials and its influence on membrane concentration process were explored by means of multi-disciplinary methods. The mass transfer effect and mechanism of membrane concentration process on traditional Chinese medicine materials were elaborated. The equilibrium points of critical osmotic pressure (RO process) and critical flux (membrane distillation process) were found.

This study conducted a system-Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) analysis to investigate how innovation and technology investments influence carbon emissions in selected OECD economies from 2000 to 2014. Using data from the OECD database and the World Development Indicators (World Bank database), it employed four proxies of innovation and technology investments, namely, renewable energy consumption, the number of researchers, spending on research and development and the number of triadic patent families. The results indicated that, after applying the dynamic model and controlling for endogeneity, renewable energy consumption and spending on research and development have a statistically significant negative relationship with carbon emissions. The number of triadic patent families illustrates a positive and significant relationship with carbon emissions, but in the case of the number of researchers, the relationship was positive but not significant. Overall, this suggests that innovation and technology investments in these countries affect emissions differently and still have the potential to reduce environmental quality. It is concluded that ensuring that patents include natural environmental standard specifications and that researchers are better equipped with green skills and knowledge would enhance the achievement of zero-emission targets.', authkeywords='Carbon emissions | Innovation and technology investments | Number of researchers | Number of triadic patent families | Renewable energy consumption | Spending on research and development', citedby_count=373, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85063393467', doi='10.1021/acs.joc.8b03001', pii=None, pubmed_id='30900880', title='Sustainability Challenges in Peptide Synthesis and Purification: From R&D to Production', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Isidro-Llobet A.', afid='60105084;60025685;60020649;60009968;60004781;60004219;60002717;60001673', affilname='Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;Eli Lilly and Company;GlaxoSmithKline plc.;Novartis International AG;Ipsen;AstraZeneca;Bristol-Myers Squibb;Amgen Incorporated', affiliation_city='Ridgefield;Indianapolis;Brentford;Basel;Boulogne-Billancourt;Cambridge;New York;Thousand Oaks', affiliation_country='United States;United States;United Kingdom;Switzerland;France;United Kingdom;United States;United States', author_count='8', author_names='Isidro-Llobet, Albert;Kenworthy, Martin N.;Mukherjee, Subha;Kopach, Michael E.;Wegner, Katarzyna;Gallou, Fabrice;Smith, Austin G.;Roschangar, Frank', author_ids='8957731600;7003508135;55781260800;6603257257;57207958620;6601955164;57202222261;6603453418', author_afids='60020649;60004219;60002717;60025685;60004781;60009968;60001673;60105084', coverDate='2019-04-19', coverDisplayDate='19 April 2019', publicationName='Journal of Organic Chemistry', issn='00223263', source_id='25896', eIssn='15206904', aggregationType='Journal', volume='84', issueIdentifier='8', article_number=None, pageRange='4615-4628', description='In recent years, there has been a growing interest in therapeutic peptides within the pharmaceutical industry with more than 50 peptide drugs on the market, approximately 170 in clinical trials, and >200 in preclinical development.

Microvessels have been described as <150 μm in diameter, but clinically they are defined as <1 mm. With new advances in super microsurgery, vessels less than 1 mm can be anastomosed to the recipient circulation. However, this technical advancement still relies on the creation of a stable engineered microcirculation that is amenable to surgical manipulation and is readily perfusable. Microvascular engineering lays on the crossroads of microfabrication, microfluidics, and tissue engineering strategies that utilize various cellular constituents. Early research focused on vascularization by co-culture and cellular interactions, with the addition of angiogenic growth factors to promote vascular growth. Since then, multiple strategies have been utilized taking advantage of innovations in additive manufacturing, biomaterials, and cell biology. However, the anatomy and dynamics of native blood vessels has not been consistently replicated. Inconsistent results can be partially attributed to cell sourcing which remains an enigma for microvascular engineering. Variations of endothelial cells, endothelial progenitor cells, and stem cells have all been used for microvascular network fabrication along with various mural cells.

Consequently, stretchable sensors must fulfill many requirements, such as high stretchability, high comfortability, high sensitivity, and long-term wear. To address these challenges, investigators have devoted considerable research effort to the development of technology, and much progress has been achieved. Here, recent developments with stretchable sensors are described, including human motion monitoring sensors, vital sign monitoring sensors, and sensors for environmental monitoring around biological surfaces. The latest successful examples of supersensitive sensors for achieving stretchability by novel materials or structures are reviewed.

As part of IMPRESS, we have developed and taught a first-year course \"Metacognitive Approaches to Scientific Inquiry.\" The course, which satisfies the Institute\\'s Ethical Perspectives requirement, introduces students to a variety of metacognitive issues and practices including: Developing a growth mindset; Bloom\\'s and Perry\\'s taxonomies for content and intellectual development; inaccuracy in self-assessment; lateral and longitudinal transfer of knowledge and experiences; and the benefits of self-reflection. Over 200 students in five years have taken the course, with very promising results. Retention of IMPRESS 1st-generation and DHH students into their 2nd, 3rd and 4th year are all above 80%, at or exceeding the institutional average. IMPRESS student demographics are inclusive: 35% are women; 32% from identities historically excluded from STEM disciplines; and 17% Deaf or Hard of Hearing (DHH). Retention results are consistent across these demographics. In qualitative research focus groups students consistently report IMPRESS experiences as lifechanging. Students recognize that issues and strategies learned in the class can be used in their other classes and that this class essentially teaches them \"how to learn.\" Students also report great appreciation for a class in which disciplinary faculty (as opposed to academic or student support staff) demonstrate meaningful care for students as humans. Additionally, a quantitative study comparing IMPRESS students with a matched group of non-IMPRESS 1st-generation/DHH students found that IMPRESS students were more likely to report satisfaction with their choice of RIT as an institution.

The research study is designed to illustrate the impact of CBMs in the manufacturing and service sectors through a combination of real-life examples and direct references to existing literature. Design/methodology/approach: The underlying research study follows a systematic literature review approach where the relevant CBMs are explored in the context of the manufacturing and service sector (FI.) The journals most cited in the context of CBMs and their implication in the manufacturing and service sector were chosen for this study. There was no fixed timeframe applied to complete the research. A total of 54 articles were selected which referenced: discussion in the context of the concept of CBMs; different types of CBM; definition of the manufacturing sector; definition of the service sector (FI); application of different CBMs in these two sectors; and included a comparison of the application of CBMs. In total, 40 of the 54 articles were shortlisted for best relevance and used in the research study. Findings: The underlying research study was limited to 40 articles and the data contained within them. The article search was limited to the keywords of the CBM; the implication of CBM; the CBM in manufacturing (textiles); circular business in service (FI); and comparison and application of the CBM. Practical implications: The final analysis demonstrates that circular business promotes sustainability by allowing companies to generate maximum return from given resources and reach zero waste targets. Greater customer satisfaction is also achieved through service innovation that cuts down negative impact on the environment. These findings are relevant and applicable to the FI. Originality/value: A review of existing literature showed that whilst there is significant research on the implications of the CBM in general, there has been little focus on the use of different CBMs specifically in the manufacturing and service industry (FI).

One such innovation is frame integrated panel door. This type of door helps automobile companies to have the advantages of both conventional panel and frame type doors. Though it has a good number of advantages, there are some drawbacks too. It requires improvements in its quality, NVH performance, weight and etc. Quality of a door is low due to the limitations in structural design and manufacturing technologies. And it is difficult to have a robust structure which leads to degradation of key performing factors such as NVH. For a lightweight vehicle, it is important to design an optimized structure for saving weight, without compromising its performance. In order to overcome these drawbacks a new optimized design structure is required for door system. This Research paper is about a systematic design methodology for Development of a new optimized door structural design by a comprehensive engineering design analysis of existing design constrains and drawbacks. The design methodology is described as below. Step 1 is the System analysis. The correlation of all components constituting the door was schematized and their functional relationships were modeled to analyze door system. Step 2 is the Problem analysis. The occurrence-sequence mechanism for problems was enumerated and the root cause was analyzed by investigating up to the sub ordinate level components in door system. Step 3 is deriving the concepts. Using the theory of inventive problem solving techniques, new concepts were derived from a variety of parameters such as new structures, materials and manufacturing processes.

At the same time with innovative manufacturing approaches and methods, can born new professions, new knowledge and skills that will be more and more required to employees, managers and trainers. In this context, it is central to have innovative learning curricula for use of state-of-the-art technologies and this aspect demands manufacturing SMEs highly qualified staff. To enhance the competitiveness and the growth of businesses it is required the upskilling and training of employees to enable effective implementation of the business processes. This poses a significant challenge to SMEs, which often lack the funds and human resources to invest in staff training and translates into a distinct need to provide comprehensive upskilling and training programs in the form of smart learning solutions designed to enable SME personnel to pursue their training goals in a flexible, customizable and easy-to-access way.

Multimedia has become the biggest of big data as the foundation of today's data-driven discoveries. Almost all disciplines of science and engineering, as well as social sciences, involve multimedia data in some forms, such as recording experiments, driverless cars, unmanned aerial vehicles, smart communities, biomedical instruments, security surveillance. Some recent events demonstrate the power of real-Time broadcast of unfolding events on social networks. Multimedia data is not just big in volume, but also multi-modal and mostly unstructured. Storing, indexing, searching, integrating, and recognizing from the vast amounts of data create unprecedented challenges. Even though significant progress has been made processing multimedia data, today's solutions are inadequate in handling data from millions of sources simultaneously. The IEEE International Conference on Multimedia Information Processing and Retrieval (IEEE-MIPR) aims to provide a forum for original research contributions and practical system design, implementation, and applications of multimedia information processing and retrieval for single modality or multiple modalities. The target audiences are university researchers, scientists, industry practitioners, software engineers, and graduate students who want to become acquainted with technologies for big data analytics, machine intelligence, information fusion in multimedia information processing and retrieval. Following a successful debut in Miami, Florida in 2018, the second MIPR, held in San Jose, California, attracted over 140 submissions and more than 100 attendees-A big growth from its inaugural event and an indication of its growing visibility and popularity in the multimedia research society.

Taking into account a very dynamic growth of the field, all this indicates the research gap to be filled. The research sample is made of 14,158 publications indexed in Scopus database comprising the phrase \"cloud computing\" in their titles. The study was purposely limited to the title search to concentrate the attention of publications relating directly to the issue of cloud computing. Applying the quantitative approach provides an opportunity for broad scanning of subject-related literature. First, general publication profiling recognized the main contributors (countries, research intuitions, source titles and authors) to the scholarly community interested in cloud computing. Secondly, subject area profiling was applied to find how multidisciplinary is the research in the field and how the research output is distributed across subject areas.

The current bone wax products are commonly packed in easy-to-open foil in the form of sterile sticks or plates, with excellent malleability and smooth consistency, enabling cost-effective and easy handling approach for bleeding control. It has also been reported that the inert nature of bone wax causes complications including foreign body reaction, infection promotion and bone healing inhibition. With the advances in biomaterials and the market boost of bone haemostatic materials, the arena of bone wax substitute research has expanded to a wide spectrum of material formulations and forms. However, the development of substitutes of bone wax for translation is a pivotal yet challenging topic because currently a potential candidate is recommended to be just as simple to use, effective and inexpensive to produce as traditional bone wax but also be absorbable and osteogenic. This review provides an overview of bone wax including its history, clinical applications and associated complication. In addition, emerging substitutes of bone wax and outlooks of future directions including the standardised evaluation methods are also discussed as an effort to catalyse the innovation and translation of bone haemostatic agents in the near future. The translational potential of this article: Occurrence of osseous haemorrhage is common in surgically incised or traumatically fractured bone. It is essential to stop bone bleeding to avoid further pathologic consequences such as tissue necrosis and eventually mortalities due to blood loss. Medical sterile bone wax is a classical material for haemostasis of bone during orthopaedic surgeries, thoracic surgeries, neurological surgeries and so on. Along with its widespread use, complications such as foreign body reaction, bone healing inhibition and infection promotion associated with bone wax are observed. With the growing knowledge in biomaterials and the boost of market of bone haemostatic materials, bone wax substitute research is thriving.

Throughout much of its history, oceanography has relied upon a broad range of instrumentation (bathyscaphes, tide gauges, and so forth). The importance of instrumentation meant that many of the exchanges during major scientific meetings in the 1960s focused on engineering problems. As a result, institutional investments by NASA and the French space agency, the Centre National d’Études Spatiales (CNES) supported advances in instrumentation. The emergence of the climate change issue made it possible to merge several factors (technical, geopolitical, and institutional) into the specialty of space oceanography. The birth of a scientific specialty requires the conjunction of several determining factors: a powerful disciplinary basis, a technological innovation resulting in major advances, and scientific politicians capable of tackling new problems. The development of space oceanography provides an excellent example of the origin of a new scientific specialty. The purpose of this article is to trace the history of the combination of the technical and scientific factors that resulted in the origin of space oceanography. This article will focus on specific events that led to the origin of space oceanography, in particular on a series of meetings organized by researchers interested in very specific technical questions. Many of the classical questions of oceanography could be addressed and dealt with by developing and using new instruments (e.g. radar altimeters). To document how the specialty of space oceanography developed, I propose to follow American and French examples of the transformations induced by space oceanography. Such a comparison makes it possible to measure the differential scientific ‘maturity’ of a nascent speciality. The emergence of climate change research, starting in the 1970s, reorganized many of the oceanographic research questions and legitimized the extension of the discipline into geospatial research. One goal of this article is to understand how this development of science policy influenced interactions between different disciplines.', authkeywords='France | Oceanography | Satellites | Space | United States of America', citedby_count=1, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='CNRS', fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85064404980', doi='10.1088/1755-1315/242/3/032051', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Research on innovation design of the DTH drill based on reverse engineering', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Wan Y.', afid='60028891', affilname=\"Chang'an University\", affiliation_city=\"Xi'an\", affiliation_country='China', author_count='3', author_names='Wan, Yipin;Xia, Yongbo;Song, Xuding', author_ids='56723323500;57208299854;14829487400', author_afids='60028891;60028891;60028891', coverDate='2019-04-01', coverDisplayDate='1 April 2019', publicationName='IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science', issn='17551307', source_id='19900195068', eIssn='17551315', aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume='242', issueIdentifier='3', article_number='032051', pageRange=None, description='This paper analyzes the theory of reverse engineering methods, combining with digital modeling technology and virtual prototype technology, a model of product innovation design is established and the evaluation index is introduced based on the theory of reverse engineering.

Yet, the outcomes of this policy orientation are debatable. Macro-level indicators continue to show weak performance in firm innovation, and there is also evidence that this policy stance has had material effects on science at the meso and micro levels. If so much public investment has gone into harnessing university-industry collaborations for a substantial period of time, why has Canada not seen an uptick in innovative activity? To address this puzzle, we turned our gaze to the policy machinery that promotes academic-industrial collaboration. We carried out case studies of two long-standing federal programs supporting research and development activities between universities and industry. Both programs are administered by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), Canada's largest funder of natural sciences and engineering research. Drawing from multiple sources of data, we find that underneath the apparently successful implementation of these programs lies a misalignment between micro- and meso-level incentives for collaboration, and macro-level policy goals related to technological innovation and economic renewal. Our article makes two main contributions. First, it calls into question the escalating federal investments in university-industry partnership programs, as long as their ability to meet operational milestones remains the main source of evaluation. Second, it demonstrates the relevance and need for the literature to go beyond a focus on narrow technical questions at the micro level, and address broader questions about the purpose, goals, and beneficiaries of university-industry collaboration policy.\", authkeywords='Canada | innovation | research policy | technology transfer | university-industry partnerships', citedby_count=17, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='NSERC', fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85064082835', doi='10.1016/j.coisb.2019.02.011', pii='S2452310019300101', pubmed_id=None, title='Chromatin research and biological engineering: an evolving relationship poised for new biomedical impacts', subtype='re', subtypeDescription='Review', creator='Haynes K.A.', afid='60136860', affilname='Wallace H.

Design/Participants: Undergraduate students were assessed pre/post course for their perceptions of 1) the importance of, and 2) their confidence in their ability to ethically reason using a digital version of the Survey of Ethical Reasoning, an instrument previously tested in this population. Results: Participants demonstrated a significant gain in their ethical reasoning confidence and maintained their high ranking of the importance of ethical reasoning concurrently to producing innovative products. Conclusions: It is possible, with deliberate instruction, for transdisciplinary undergraduate students to develop ethical reasoning confidence concurrently to developing innovative products.', authkeywords='Design thinking | Ethical reasoning | Ethics | Innovation | Interdisciplinary | Transdisciplinary', citedby_count=9, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85057033534', doi='10.1016/j.respol.2018.11.004', pii='S0048733318302750', pubmed_id=None, title='Towards a segmentation of science parks: A typology study on science parks in Europe', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Ng W.K.B.', afid='60032882', affilname='Technische Universiteit Eindhoven', affiliation_city='Eindhoven', affiliation_country='Netherlands', author_count='4', author_names='Ng, Wei Keat Benny;Appel-Meulenbroek, Rianne;Cloodt, Myriam;Arentze, Theo', author_ids='57204760699;23491517500;6505589051;7003679509', author_afids='60032882;60032882;60032882;60032882', coverDate='2019-04-01', coverDisplayDate='April 2019', publicationName='Research Policy', issn='00487333', source_id='22900', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='48', issueIdentifier='3', article_number=None, pageRange='719-732', description='Although science parks are established globally for decades as an innovation policy instrument to foster growth and networking, there is limited attention given towards research into possible types within these real estate objects. Prior attempts in categorising science parks are characterised by the limited number of cases and/or variables. Science parks are believed to enhance innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic value for firms and regions. Past academic research showed mixed results on these performances and it is reasoned that distinct types within science parks exist that might explain these unclear results. We argue that before we can grasp what science parks can do, we should know what they are. Therefore, a survey on science park characteristics was completed by 82 science park managers in Europe. A cluster analysis was conducted which grouped the 82 participating science parks in three types; ‘research’, ‘cooperative’, and ‘incubator’ locations. Next, differences and similarities of these three types within science parks in Europe were analysed as a basis for advancing the academic debate. The types provide further understanding of science parks and offer researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers a means to compare, market, and benchmark science parks more adequately.', authkeywords='Cluster analysis | Europe | Innovation policy | Science park | Segmentation', citedby_count=51, openaccess=0, freetoread='repositoryvor', freetoreadLabel='Green', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85033683906', doi='10.1016/j.jengtecman.2017.10.003', pii='S0923474817303934', pubmed_id=None, title='Customising and deploying roadmapping in an organisational setting: The LEGO Group experience', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Kerr C.', afid='60113622;60031101', affilname='LEGO System AS;University of Cambridge', affiliation_city='Billund;Cambridge', affiliation_country='Denmark;United Kingdom', author_count='3', author_names='Kerr, Clive;Phaal, Robert;Thams, Kasper', author_ids='7202213993;7003791668;57196724467', author_afids='60031101;60031101;60113622', coverDate='2019-04-01', coverDisplayDate='April - June 2019', publicationName='Journal of Engineering and Technology Management - JET-M', issn='09234748', source_id='20575', eIssn='16084799', aggregationType='Journal', volume='52', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='48-60', description='When roadmapping is being introduced into an organisation, there are a number of ‘reference’ processes which can be consulted to help ease the barriers to implementation.

Through the coupling of 2 or more different factors, organisms can effectively realize various functional characteristics of organisms and fully display their best adaptability to habitats,this phenomenon of biological coupling is ubiquitous in the biological world. The multi-bionics of learning and simulating the coupling mechanism of organisms is called coupling bionics. The drag reduction mechanism of dolphin skin is a typical representative of the bio-binary coupling. Dolphin skin is composed of smooth elastic keraphyllous epidermis and hard dermis, which are intertwined with each other. The coupling effect of the 2 parts is one of the main reasons why dolphins can swim fast. According to the principle of bionic similarity, Jilin University has designed a coupling functional surface which imitates the skin structure of dolphins, and applied it to the surface of the key parts (centrifugal impeller) of centrifugal pump, which can significantly improve the pump efficiency. The specific method is to directly cast the ribbed structure similar to the dolphin skin dermis on the upper and lower cover plate of impeller by one-step casting technology, and then coat the cover plate with high viscous polyurethane as the surface material. The ribbed structure at the bottom and the polyurethane coating on the surface constitute a coupling bionic functional surface. The thickness parameters of surface material coating have the greatest influence on the efficiency of coatings, and polyurethane is the main material for coating, but because of the complicated and twisted space structure of the inner passage of centrifugal pump impeller, the high viscosity characteristics of polyurethane and the limitation of traditional coating technology, it is difficult to achieve high efficiency and high quality coating on the surface of complex impeller inner runners with coupling bionic functional surface layer materials. and it is difficult to control the thickness of the coating. In order to solve the above problems, a self-made rotating coating equipment by means of centrifugal force was introduced in this paper, using which, the coating thickness could be controlled by pouring temperature, rotating speed, coating time and other parameters. According to the combination design principle of Box-Behnken Design in Design-Expert software, taking the coating thickness of impeller runner as test index, a 3 factors and 3 levels orthogonal combination experiment was designed, the above parameters were optimized and the quadratic fitting equation was established. The test results showed that the main and secondary factors affecting the coating thickness were rotating speed of equipment, pouring temperature and coating duration. The comparative coating tests were carried out on the impeller of 200QJ50-26 centrifugal pump, the results showed that the errors between tested coating thickness controlled by coating parameters and calculated value of quadratic fitting equation was less than 5%, the results were credible. According to the previous research results, when the coating thickness is 0.5 mm, the drag reduction and efficiency increasing of 200QJ50-26 centrifugal pump is the best. The test results showed that the optimum coating parameters for 200 QJ50-26 centrifugal pump to obtain the optimum coating thickness of 0.5 mm were as follows: coating duration was 53.7 s, rotating speed was 401 rad/min, pouring temperature was 90.1℃.

Among these innovative magnetic devices, many have shown great superiority and subversiveness. Now there is a trend that these innovative techniques may replace traditional techniques. Some advanced magnetic surgical techniques can vastly simplify existing surgical procedures, lower operation difficulty, shorten operation time and improve treatment effect. Others may even challenge the current treatment mode of some diseases. And the concept of magnetic surgery has been changed rapidly. Nevertheless, many common vital bottleneck problems remain unsolved in this new area. The fundamental research on the biologic effects of magnets is far from sufficient. The core problems of magnetic techniques still hang in doubt. The cooperation and integration among institutes of medicine, science and engineering are lacking. The research results remain in certain areas and are more theoretical with little practicability. The last but not the least, the scientific conception and clinical application standards of this novel technique are still vacant. Recently, Chinese researchers have made systemic researches in magnetic surgery and invented a series of international leading techniques. They have achieved remarkable achievements in theoretical innovation and discipline construction, which have occupied the leading place in the world. This article was aimed at discussing the establishment and development of the international discipline of magnetic surgery. In the meantime, this article summarized the developing situation and foundation of magnetic surgery while created expectations. In this article, the authors firstly divided developmental stages of magnetic surgery in a scientific manner. The authors proposed five major systems of magnetic surgery and suggested establishing the discipline of magnetic surgery with interdisciplinary integration. The authors made all efforts to lay a solid foundation of basic researches, set up a theoretical system, standardize clinical researches, and strengthened interdisciplinary integration of magnetic materials, biomechanics and clinical diagnosis and treatment. The authors devoted themselves to unit experts on rare earth metals, biomechanics and clinical medicine. With the integration of multi-institutes, the discipline of magnetic surgery will be soon established normatively. Novel techniques of magnetic surgery will be carried out in clinical application researches.

Also, the study showed that though the exposure to that the teachers and students had to STEM pedagogy was the first time, they appreciated it and found it aided their understanding of the concepts they performed during the programs.

Three stages of the project are presented and described. The results, measured by the Institutional Opinion Survey of the Student and the comments the students, show that the teaching methodology satisfies the expectations of the students.

A 13-item survey graded on a 5-point Likert scale was administered to 350 Mexican students from two states, Chiapas and Nuevo Leon, as part of a broad research project that aims to determine which factors and players influence the perceptions of teenagers, from a gender perspective, about STEM fields. Results show statistically significant differences among group participants in the perceptions of the value of biology to their academic futures (T-Test, p=0.035) between genders in the state of Nuevo Leon (T-Test, p=0.037, 0.083). Results also show significant correlation between parents' levels of education and students' self-efficacy (Pearson correlations). Conclusions drawn from this paper discuss the relatedness of teenagers' STEM perceptions and their academic and professional futures with respect to gender, geographic residency, family and self-efficacy.

We have measured the impact of using this strategy on student learning. For the last two semesters the outcome has been positive for our learning model, in both quantitative and qualitative variables. We have carried out a parametric hypotheses test, comparing the mean grades obtained in a similar final exam, by students having followed our new method with those having a traditional learning method.

They used the entrepreneurial skills acquired through this training to scale-up their emerging innovation, the Cincinnati Engineering Enhanced Math and Science Program (CEEMS), which had been developed, implemented, and evaluated with successful results over a period of seven years in a targeted 14 school-district partnership in Greater Cincinnati. The overriding goal was to improve student learning and success rates in K–12 math and science courses by helping to accelerate the process of bringing effective educational innovation, CEEMS, to scale. In CEEMS, teachers were trained in using challenge-based learning (CBL) and the engineering design process (EDP), teaching pedagogies to transform their classrooms into student-centered, hands-on learning environments, while also assisting students to improve their evaluation scores related to science, math, and engineering instruction. CEEMS teachers acquired the necessary skills through coursework, professional development (PD) workshops, and longitudinal professional guidance provided by assigned coaches over a period of two years to become proficient in developing CBL–EDP curriculum, teaching it, and assessing student learning and reflecting after teaching. The authors have documented how they used customer market research conducted during the I-Corps L training to define their minimum viable product (MVP) to duplicate the successful CEEMS methodology through a condensed (≤16 week) self-paced, completely online training program with virtual coaching support. The authors also describe the process they used to move forward very quickly from an MVP to a more complete product offering, its branding, the process of trademarking it, and finally licensing it to an established non-profit organization (NPO) for future marketing.

Kidney injuries provoke a high request of organ transplants making it the most demanding system in the field of regenerative medicine. Furthermore, renal cancer frequently threaten patients’ life and aggressive forms still remain difficult to treat. Ethical issues related to the use of embryonic stem cells, has fueled research on adult, patient-specific pluripotent stem cells as a model for discovery and therapeutic development, but to date, normal and cancerous renal experimental models are lacking. Several research groups are focusing on the development of organoid cultures. Since organoids mimic the original tissue architecture in vitro, they represent an excellent model for tissue engineering studies and cancer therapy testing. We established normal and tumor renal cell carcinoma organoids previously maintained in a heterogeneous multi-clone stem cell-like enriching medium. Starting from adult normal kidney specimens, we were able to isolate and propagate organoid 3D-structures composed of both differentiated and undifferentiated cells while expressing nephron specific markers. Furthermore, we were capable to establish organoids derived from cancer tissues although with a success rate inferior to that of their normal counterpart. Cancer cultures displayed epithelial and mesenchymal phenotype while retaining tumor specific markers. Of note, tumor organoids recapitulated neoplastic masses when orthotopically injected into immunocompromised mice. Our data suggest an innovative approach of long-term establishment of normal- and cancer-derived renal organoids obtained from cultures of fleshly dissociated adult tissues. Our results pave the way to organ replacement pioneering strategies as well as to new models for studying drug-induced nephrotoxicity and renal diseases.

Building infrastructures are always a challenge for engineers because of uncertainties in different aspects. Using an experimental model is an essential technique for reducing uncertainties. However, using experimental data adds other uncertainties to the problems and dealing with them can play a key role in project applicability and success. Uncertainties in every engineering problem can be classified into three distinct groups related to the computer model: (1) numerical uncertainty, (2) parameter uncertainty, and (3) structural uncertainty. Among these categorized uncertainties, the second and the third ones are considered for the case study of this research. In this study, model parameter uncertainties and the structural uncertainties have been considered simultaneously. This approach is applied to a three-dimensional (3D) fixed offshore jacket model (SPD9 located in the Persian Gulf) for the first time in the offshore structure field, both numerically and experimentally. Disagreements between the numerical model predictions and experiments are reduced by considering the calibration of model uncertain parameters and a discrepancy term, which is defined by a mathematical function for a real project. Therefore, the main benefits and innovations of the methodology can be stated as (1) using experimental data through modal analysis of a 3D steel offshore jacket platform for numerical model updating and (2) developing a previously studied method through reducing parametric and structural uncertainties simultaneously. The results express the success of considering parameter uncertainty and structural uncertainty for the previously mentioned case study by decreasing the disagreements between experimental data and numerical simulation. The results also indicate the importance of considering a discrepancy term in the calculation phase as a model form error term due to increasing the applicability of the proposed method for an offshore jacket platform.', authkeywords='Discrepancy function | Finite-element model updating | Model form error | Offshore jacket platform | Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm | Uncertainty analysis', citedby_count=10, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85061798640', doi='10.1038/s41563-018-0275-2', pii=None, pubmed_id='30783227', title='Advances in magnetoelectric multiferroics', subtype='re', subtypeDescription='Review', creator='Spaldin N.A.', afid='60121382;60025858;60025038;60007174', affilname='Department of Materials Science and Engineering;ETH Zürich;University of California, Berkeley;Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory', affiliation_city='Berkeley;Zurich;Berkeley;Berkeley', affiliation_country='United States;Switzerland;United States;United States', author_count='2', author_names='Spaldin, N.

In previous research, we explored the separate effects of three such design interventions: teaming, problem framing, and design heuristics. In the teaming intervention, participants discussed a design prompt together but recorded their own ideas separately. In problem framing, multiple versions (framings) of each design prompt were used to elicit different solutions. In design heuristics, participants used specially designed cards to prompt new ways of thinking about the given design problem. In the current work, we compared the effects of these three interventions on students' design ideas with respect to one idea attribute in particular-quality. In total, 1088 design concepts were collected from 171 undergraduate students in engineering and industrial design from two universities. Individual cognitive style was also assessed using Kirton's Adaption-Innovation inventory (KAI). Six metrics taken from the design literature were used to assess the quality of each concept, namely: acceptability, applicability, clarity, effectiveness, implementability, and implicational explicitness. Paired t-tests and Pearson correlations were used to assess differences in quality between concepts generated with and without the three interventions; in addition, secondary effects were sought based on the cognitive styles and academic standings of the participants. Statistically significant differences were observed in design concept quality for the teaming and design heuristics interventions over the full sample and for some subgroups separated by cognitive style and academic standing. These results have implications for how educators teach design interventions and how students choose and apply interventions to affect the quality of their own design solutions.\", authkeywords='design concepts | design interventions | Idea generation | quality metrics', citedby_count=10, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='NSF', fund_no='1264551', fund_sponsor='National Science Foundation'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85059325860', doi='10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.11.061', pii='S0959652618334590', pubmed_id=None, title='Striving for benefits of sustainability from the interactivity of quality and innovation', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Anttila J.', afid='60002952;113202237', affilname='Helsingin Yliopisto;International Academy for Quality (IAQ)', affiliation_city='Helsinki;Helsinki', affiliation_country='Finland;Finland', author_count='2', author_names='Anttila, Juhani;Jussila, Kari', author_ids='16201785200;55490174300', author_afids='113202237;60002952', coverDate='2019-03-01', coverDisplayDate='1 March 2019', publicationName='Journal of Cleaner Production', issn='09596526', source_id='19167', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='212', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='409-419', description='In this article, sustainability is considered as a subset of quality and as a challenging target area to innovations for the quality of society. Quality and innovation are conceptually age-old issues and significant business factors today. They represent two distinct professional disciplines, which have a lot of meaningful connections. However, their formal definitions have not been commonly established and neither have their relationships been clearly recognized. Hence in this article, their practical definitions and interactivity are discussed and highlighted regarding individuals, organizations and society. Also, the relatively new concept of sustainability is not understood unambiguously nor practiced consistently. The purpose of the article is to clarify the concepts and to present a comprehensive approach to the theory of sustainability through interactive quality and innovation management for enhancing the quality of society. Organizations play an important role in striving for sustainable development. Quality and innovation management should be considered in an integrated way in the organizations, and they should cover the area of sustainability. In the whole society, sustainability is realized through diffusion. National and regional initiatives have been launched to promote quality, innovation and sustainability measures. Ultimately, quality and innovation are based on human creativity, activity, and perception. In this article, discipline-dedicated research and development of quality and innovation, interdisciplinary collaboration and multidisciplinary integrative realization of the specific organizational solutions are highlighted and conceptualized. The ideas presented are based on the long-term practical experience of the authors and our studies from different perspectives and critical inference.

Despite this impetuous growth, the electricity infrastructure is not yet ready to accept increasing shares of variable renewable energy sources (RES) generation, and this is causing grid balance challenges, due to the inherently variable nature of the PV and wind energy. In order to overcome this issue, allowing higher shares of renewable generation in the energy sector, energy storage (ES) systems are becoming increasingly competitive in the global energy landscape, thanks to the positive momentum in research and innovation, making European energy supply more secure, sustainable and affordable. Despite the unarguable benefits, storage technologies still see significant needs for more education among stakeholders, since they are not familiar with technology's benefits and management solutions. In order to fill this gap, this study provides an overview of storage technologies for stationary applications in the EU (plus Bosnia-Erzegovina, Norway and Switzerland), addressing the main trends in European policy legislation, also identifying advantages and barriers for their implementation. Furthermore, based on the analysis of the US Department of Energy (DOE) storage database, the main trends in ES installations within the EU markets are identified, with reference to storage technologies.

Most extant research focuses on innovations within classroom settings that can improve learning outcomes for students pursuing STEM majors. Additional research is needed in examining how the sequencing of courses taken by students can help or hinder their progress toward the successful completion of a STEM degree. In this first phase of our research, quantitative analytics was used to identify the impact of specific courses on students’ risk of dropping out of a Math major. Findings suggest a general inverse correlation between academic performance and attrition: good performance predicts lower attrition rates. Survival analysis indicated that the further a student goes within the math major, the greater the risk of dropping out. Students in a Math major tend to be more likely to drop out after their 4th year compared to their first three years. In general, students show increased inclination to switch majors from their second year and those students who have stayed in the program for too long are very likely to switch to another major.\", authkeywords='Data mining | Learning analytics | Predictive model | Survival analysis', citedby_count=9, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85029693737', doi='10.1016/j.strueco.2017.08.002', pii='S0954349X16300704', pubmed_id=None, title=\"Industrial innovation and productive structures: The creation of America's ‘Arsenal of democracy’\", subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Best M.H.', afid=None, affilname=None, affiliation_city=None, affiliation_country=None, author_count='1', author_names='Best, Michael H.', author_ids='7101833261', author_afids=None, coverDate='2019-03-01', coverDisplayDate='March 2019', publicationName='Structural Change and Economic Dynamics', issn='0954349X', source_id='29487', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='48', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='32-41', description=\"This paper uses World War II as a real world laboratory to examine the historical-structural origins of America's unique systemic capability to create new and transform existing industrial sectors.

American wartime industrial policy did not correct for market failure; it designed and fostered permanent organizational changes in the productive structures of the economy that transformed the national system of industrial innovation. The War Production Board (WPB) was at the center of both macroeconomic and production policymaking. Its focus was on the measurement, coordination and transformation of production. The Office of Scientific Research and Development was at the center of the creation of an inter-organizational science and technology R&D system. Simon Kuznets, economist at the WPB, was the author of the Victory Program by which economic and military strategies were coordinated. Vannevar Bush was the organizational architect of America's ‘triple helix’ system to create and rapidly grow advanced technology weapon systems. With hindsight, Kuznets and Bush, and the agencies they represented, combined to inter-connect the productive structures to enact a strategy to integrate mass production with technological innovation.

The majority of the crashes have severe outcomes, especially when an object is hit (tree, pole, supports, front wall of a culvert, barrier). These accidents represent app. 19% of all of Poland's road deaths. Roadside crashes involve: hitting a tree, hitting a barrier, hitting a sign or utility pole, vehicle roll-over on the roadside, vehicle roll-over on a slope and vehicle roll-over into a ditch. Understanding the effects of roadside factors on road safety requires in-depth research. The problem was partly addressed at the WMCAUS conference in 2017 [1]. Key to understanding the needs and tools of road infrastructure management for preventing run-off-road crashes or minimising their consequences is to identify the hazards and sources of hazards caused by wrong or improper use of road safety devices. It is also important to identify errors in the design, structure, construction and operation of road safety devices. Studying such an extended scope of the problem required fieldwork. Site tests had to be conducted such as hitting a wire rope barrier and a steel barrier on curve (test TB32), light and heavy vehicles hitting a bridge parapet (tests TB11 and TB51), hitting a transition between a steel and wire rope barrier (TB32) and crashes into a lighting column placed within the barrier's working width. In addition, the project includes numerical tests validated on the basis of site tests. This helps to assess the behaviour of road restraint systems when selected parameters are changed. The work is part of the RID Programme (Development of Road Innovation) and the RoSE project (Road Safety Equipment). In the article the authors present the effects of building a road restraint system database for a selected test site (about 3,000 km of Poland's national roads). An outline of new road restraint system guidelines could only be developed after understanding the effects of restraint systems, the design, additional elements, type of road and safety barrier location on a road or engineering structure and the road and traffic conditions on their functionality and safety. The paper will present the preliminary results of this research. Once complete, the research will offer tools to help with the implementation of road restraint systems. The tools will ensure that road infrastructure is safer and that the most common mistakes are eliminated.\", authkeywords=None, citedby_count=9, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr='NCBR', fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='Narodowe Centrum Badań i Rozwoju'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85130225165', doi='10.4018/9781522581888', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Strategic innovations and interdisciplinary perspectives in telecommunications and networking', subtype='bk', subtypeDescription='Book', creator='Meghanathan N.', afid='60000238', affilname='Jackson State University', affiliation_city='Jackson', affiliation_country='United States', author_count='1', author_names='Meghanathan, Natarajan', author_ids='14632378800', author_afids='60000238', coverDate='2019-02-22', coverDisplayDate='22 February 2019', publicationName='Strategic Innovations and Interdisciplinary Perspectives in Telecommunications and Networking', issn=None, source_id='21101089372', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Book', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='1-348', description='The lack of clear communication, especially internationally, plagues the modern world in a variety of fields.

The results show that technological innovation had no significant impact on the GTFE of industrial water resources in China and the eastern region. It had a restraining impact on the central region, while a positive effect on the western region. Environmental regulation was not conducive to the improvement of China's GTFE of industrial water resources, and the promotion of efficiency in the eastern, central, and western regions was not significant. The interaction between technological innovation and environmental regulation positively affected the GTFE of industrial water resources of China, whereas it had a negative impact on the central region and an insignificant impact on the eastern and central regions. This showed that there were regional, economic, and industrial structure differences in the effect of technological innovation and environmental regulation on the GTFE of industrial water resources.

The invention of such a flexible, versatile, and power efficient actuator opens the gate for a new generation of lightweight, highly efficient, and multifunctional robotics. Many current artificial muscle technologies enable low-power mobile actuators, robots that mimic efficient and natural forms of motion, autonomous robots and sensors, and lightweight wearable technologies. They also have serious applications in biomedical devices, where biocompatibility, from a chemical, flexibility, and force perspective, is crucial. It remains unknown which material will ultimately form the ideal artificial muscle. Anything from shape memory alloys (SMAs) to pneumatics to electroactive polymers (EAPs) realize core aspects of the artificial muscle goal. Among them, EAPs most resemble their biological counterparts, and they encompass both ion-infusion and electric field based actuation mechanisms. Some of the most investigated EAPs are dielectric elastomers (DEs), whose large strains, fracture toughness, and power-to-weight ratios compare favorably with natural muscle. Although dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) only entered the artificial muscle conversation in the last 20 years, significant technological progress has reflected their high potential. Research has focused on solving the core issues surrounding DEAs, which includes improving their operational ranges with regard to temperature and voltage, adding new functionality to the materials, and improving the reliability of the components on which they depend. Mechanisms designed to utilize their large-strain actuation and low stiffness has also attracted attention. This Account covers important research by our group and others in various avenues such as decreasing viscoelastic losses in typical DE materials, increasing their dielectric constant, and countering electromechanical instability. We also discuss variable stiffness polymers, specifically bistable electroactive polymers, which, notably, open DEAs to structural applications typically unattainable for soft-actuator technologies. Furthermore, we explore advancements related to highly compliant and transparent electrodes, a crucial component of DEAs capable of achieving high actuation strain. We then cover noteworthy applications, including several novel devices for soft robotics and microfluidics, and how those applications fit within other major developments in the field. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the remaining challenges facing current DEA technology and speculate on research directions that may further advance DE-based artificial muscles as a whole.

With the rapid development of information technologies, the traditional large-scale education system generated in the industrial revolution era cannot satisfy the increasing demand for personalized education services in the information era. Thus currently the reform and innovation of education is at a critical turning point. To specify, personalized learning is being focused on during the global education innovation and reform, and deep reform within the education field is being promoted by big data technology. Compared with other countries, during the current global education innovation and reform, China is facing more difficult challenges caused by a large number of active learners, complex learning environment, large-scale education resource supply, and a wide variety of learning service. Therefore the problem about how to provide large-scale, high-accuracy and personalized learning in China needs to be solved urgently, which is unique without precedents. The arising of information technologies, such as internet, cloud computing, big data, and artificial intelligent, has brought in not only diversified resources, scale data, and intelligent computing, but also the fusion between education and natural science. Consequently, the scientific paradigm of education has been changed from traditional experience-based research into data driven research. Such change, on the one hand, has offered a new approach to realize accurate and scientific education; on the other hand, has made an initial breakthrough in personalized learning. A historical opportunity to educate a learner according to his/her natural ability has finally arrived. To promote the data-driven application innovation as well as to achieve scale and personalized education, have both become an inexorable trend for the modern education. Due to the continuous influence of information technologies, the boundaries of learning time and space have both been broken completely. In addition, many great changes have taken place in learning environments, methods and contents, which obviously provide learners with more choices about what to learn and how to learn. In the future, the aim of personalized learning is to satisfy the personalized development demand for each learner, however it will definitely face serious challenges, e.g., how to understand learning subjects, how to construct learning environment, and how to implement teaching. In this paper, three basic scientific problems to be solved in personalized learning are discussed, which include (1) educational scenarios is calculable; (2) learning subjects is understandable; (3) learning services is customizable. Furthermore, in order to realize differentiated instruction, personalized learning, refined management, and intelligent services, breakthroughs in both theories and technologies needed are presented in this paper, including human-technology learning environment, learning data sensing and fusion, edge computing for education scenes, learning mechanism in digital environments, student modeling and analysis under data driven, group dynamics of the learner group, education resource supply, accurate education service, intelligent tutoring system. Education is a complex dynamic system, which needs both breakthrough research and systematic research. To effectively promote the research of personalized learning, actions needs to be taken, including for example implementing education research and experiment systematically, speeding up breakthroughs and talent training, solving scientific problems in the education field by means of multidisciplinary approach and wisdom as well as the multi-party cooperation mechanism named \"politics-industry-academic-research-application\". Based on a comprehensive analysis on counter-measures and research trends to personalized learning in western developed countries, in order to cope with challenges of personalized learning and help meet the goals of Education 2030 in China, the following four suggestions are proposed in this paper: (1) promoting the formation of educational science; (2) speeding up the construction of laws and regulations related to large-scale educational data; (3) exploring data-driven instructional evaluation mechanism and methods; and (4) increasing policy support in the research on teaching competency standards and teachers\\' promotion path in the new era.', authkeywords='Artificial intelligence | Big data | Personalized learning', citedby_count=7, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85060615393', doi='10.1108/IJOEM-02-2017-0059', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Technological innovation as a source of Chinese multinationals’ firm-specific advantages and internationalization', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='He S.', afid='60165293;60162124;60007830;60000931', affilname='Brunel Business School;Kent Business School;Hankuk University of Foreign Studies;University of Northampton', affiliation_city='Uxbridge;Canterbury;Seoul;Northampton', affiliation_country='United Kingdom;United Kingdom;South Korea;United Kingdom', author_count='4', author_names='He, Shaowei;Khan, Zaheer;Lew, Yong Kyu;Fallon, Grahame', author_ids='56909205700;56189972400;55366129500;7006443592', author_afids='60000931;60162124;60007830;60165293', coverDate='2019-02-15', coverDisplayDate='15 Feb 2019', publicationName='International Journal of Emerging Markets', issn='17468809', source_id='21100304262', eIssn='17468817', aggregationType='Journal', volume='14', issueIdentifier='1', article_number=None, pageRange='115-133', description='Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how innovation-related firm-specific ownership advantage (FSA) plays a role in developing the competitive advantage of Chinese multinationals when they internationalize. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a review of the existing literature concerning foreign direct investment by emerging economy multinational enterprises (EMNEs), the authors identify that numerous studies explain this phenomenon on the basis of their location-bound country-specific advantages. However, such views do not fully explain the key underlying factors behind the rapid rise and success of many EMNEs as these firms rapidly internationalize and develop global competitiveness in developed markets. The current research explores three leading innovative Chinese EMNEs from the engineering sector: BYD, Sany Heavy Industry and CSR China. Findings: The authors find that EMNEs’ knowledge, and particularly their innovation-creating technological knowledge, has contributed greatly to their successful internationalization. The illustrative cases show that the three firms have now moved beyond the infant to the mature stage of EMNE development through developing their technological knowledge in order to realize FSA through internationalization. This study helps in contributing fresh reflections to the continuing debate concerning the causes of internationalization and global competitive development by EMNEs and the role of their FSAs in these processes. Originality/value: This is one of the few studies which have demonstrated that some of the EMNEs do possess firms’ specific advantage which helps explain their innovative capabilities, competitive advantages and subsequent internationalization patterns.', authkeywords='China | Country-specific advantages | Emerging market multinationals | Firm-specific advantages | Internationalization | Outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) | Technological innovation', citedby_count=54, openaccess=0, freetoread='repositoryam', freetoreadLabel='Green', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85058642427', doi='10.1108/IJoEM-11-2015-0245', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Absorptive capacity and innovation in China', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Reid D.M.H.', afid='60014543', affilname='Seattle University', affiliation_city='Seattle', affiliation_country='United States', author_count='1', author_names='Reid, David Mc Hardy', author_ids='56234307000', author_afids='60014543', coverDate='2019-02-15', coverDisplayDate='15 Feb 2019', publicationName='International Journal of Emerging Markets', issn='17468809', source_id='21100304262', eIssn='17468817', aggregationType='Journal', volume='14', issueIdentifier='1', article_number=None, pageRange='134-154', description='Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to question the conventional wisdom that China fails to produce distinctive innovation; its capabilities limited merely to copying and reverse engineering. The author postulates that the lack of innovation is a delayed activity since China is undergoing a process of building absorptive capacity (AC) as a precursor to innovation. Design/methodology/approach: The author probes this question by drawing on the concept of AC, a competence separate from innovativeness and a precursor to it. By drawing on the AC literature three propositions are established. Subsequently, these propositions are examined, in part, with data drawn from 34 interviews conducted in China with CEOs, other senior corporate officers and government officials. In this way, the author explores the challenges to innovating. Findings: Thomson Reuters 2015 Top Global Innovators report listed no Chinese company among its top 100 list of innovative companies. The author’s belief, however, favors China to become a source of innovation. A positive tilt derived from both interviews and recent reports published by Bain & Company, Booz and Co as well as McKinsey & Co. This evidences, the author argues, China is acquiring AC, a competence independent of innovation but a necessary antecedent to decoding and deploying the intellectual property in its portfolio. The collective effect of this is that the perception of China as a source of innovative activity will show an uptick when the AC threshold is reached. Research limitations/implications: This is a viewpoint paper grounded on an exploratory study. Practical implications: Guidance on AC development is valuable to government policy makers promoting innovation in China and those attempting to arbitrage these developments. Similarly, policy makers in competitive nations should also be aware that their innovation-focused industries may need nurturing and bolstering since they may be at risk of being swept away by a tsunami-like innovation wave from China. Originality/value: This is an original take on the relationship of AC and innovativeness in China. The author argues that in contrast to the conventional wisdom China has the potential for innovativeness.', authkeywords='Absorptive capacity | Adaptation | Appropriability of innovation | China | Innovation | Knowledge spillovers', citedby_count=19, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85047198507', doi='10.1007/s10664-018-9620-y', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Software engineering in start-up companies: An analysis of 88 experience reports', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Klotins E.', afid='60016636', affilname='Blekinge Tekniska Högskola', affiliation_city='Karlskrona', affiliation_country='Sweden', author_count='3', author_names='Klotins, Eriks;Unterkalmsteiner, Michael;Gorschek, Tony', author_ids='56728343400;36245433300;6507952308', author_afids='60016636;60016636;60016636', coverDate='2019-02-15', coverDisplayDate='15 February 2019', publicationName='Empirical Software Engineering', issn='13823256', source_id='18650', eIssn='15737616', aggregationType='Journal', volume='24', issueIdentifier='1', article_number=None, pageRange='68-102', description='Context: Start-up companies have become an important supplier of innovation and software-intensive products. The flexibility and reactiveness of start-ups enables fast development and launch of innovative products. However, a majority of software start-up companies fail before achieving any success. Among other factors, poor software engineering could be a significant contributor to the challenges experienced by start-ups. However, the state-of-practice of software engineering in start-ups, as well as the utilization of state-of-the-art is largely an unexplored area. Objective: In this study we investigate how software engineering is applied in start-up context with a focus to identify key knowledge areas and opportunities for further research. Method: We perform a multi-vocal exploratory study of 88 start-up experience reports. We develop a custom taxonomy to categorize the reported software engineering practices and their interrelation with business aspects, and apply qualitative data analysis to explore influences and dependencies between the knowledge areas. Results: We identify the most frequently reported software engineering (requirements engineering, software design and quality) and business aspect (vision and strategy development) knowledge areas, and illustrate their relationships. We also present a summary of how relevant software engineering knowledge areas are implemented in start-ups and identify potentially useful practices for adoption in start-ups. Conclusions: The results enable a more focused research on engineering practices in start-ups. We conclude that most engineering challenges in start-ups stem from inadequacies in requirements engineering. Many promising practices to address specific engineering challenges exists, however more research on adaptation of established practices, and validation of new start-up specific practices is needed.', authkeywords='Experience reports | Software engineering practices | Software start-up', citedby_count=69, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherhybridgold', freetoreadLabel='Hybrid Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85021064457', doi='10.1007/s10961-017-9598-4', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Engineering graduate students’ views on the effective ownership of academic patents', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Sohn S.', afid='60016912', affilname='Yonsei University', affiliation_city='Seoul', affiliation_country='South Korea', author_count='2', author_names='Sohn, So Young;Han, Eun Jin', author_ids='55166505200;56583520900', author_afids='60016912;60016912', coverDate='2019-02-15', coverDisplayDate='15 February 2019', publicationName='Journal of Technology Transfer', issn='08929912', source_id='144651', eIssn='15737047', aggregationType='Journal', volume='44', issueIdentifier='1', article_number=None, pageRange='132-154', description='For sustainable and effective innovation, who should own an academic patent obtained as a result of funded research?

Some factors, such as cost coefficient, cost sharing ratio, etc., will affect the enterprise's decision-making and emission reduction benefits.

Transparent soil is a desired choice to obtain information on spatial deformation inside the soil. Based on this, a novel measuring device was developed to automatically record laser speckle images at different laser cross-sections, and the displacement deformation of transparent soil at arbitrary cross-section positions was determined by the planar digital image correlation (DIC) technique. The measuring system was built with two high-precision motorized linear stages. An industrial camera was used in the system to capture the laser speckle images, and synchronization control methods of both the laser transmitter and industrial camera were introduced. The planar DIC technique employed in this paper has been described in detail. The high-precision motorized linear stages proved to have excellent repeatability and the displacement field of a certain laser cross-section in transparent soil can be obtained. Theoretically, the spatial deformation inside the transparent soil can be built based on the displacement fields of multiple laser cross-sections. Finally, the design scheme was confirmed by the model pile experiment. The experiment results show that the automatic measuring system has stable operation, and the deformation of arbitrary laser cross-sections inside transparent soil can be obtained easily.

In the context of Higher Education Commission digital library of Pakistan, the purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship of PI, quality of digital resources and generic usability of digital libraries (DL) with users’ satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach: To guide the conceptual model of this study, five hypothesized relationships were formulated. Adopting a quantitative approach, snowball sampling techniques were used. A total of 464 users of DL enrolled in different programs of study in the universities of Pakistan participated and responded to the survey. For data analyses, partial least squares, a method in the structural equation modeling was used. Findings: Analyses reveal positive and strong relationships of PI, quality of digital resources and generic usability of DL with users’ satisfaction. Thus, the findings of this study established personal traits as the significant determinants of intention to adopt DL. Research limitations/implications: The decision of effective adoption is manipulated by the extent of users’ willing (PI), level of satisfaction, the image of quality and users’ past experience with the use of related innovations. Thus, librarians in addition to the system features should also focus on individual characteristics and quality of resources that probably influence adequate adoption of DL. Originality/value: In the Pakistani context, this study is the first attempt that examined the relationship of PI, the usability of DL and quality of digital resources with users’ satisfaction.

Indeed, investigators in household air pollution (HAP) and water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH), working in poor parts of the world, rarely interact despite having similar training and using similar methods to evaluate interventions in the same vulnerable populations. Disappointing results from recent trials of improved cookstoves and traditional approaches to WaSH suggest the need for alternative approaches. OBJECTIVES: We argue that bringing these two areas together would improve the effectiveness and efficiency of interventions to reduce the massive disease burden associated with HAP and poor WaSH, including pneumonia and diarrhea, the leading killers of young children in low-income countries. RESULTS: HAP and WaSH face similar challenges in designing, implementing, and securing the sustained and exclusive use of scalable interventions such as clean fuel and water. DISCUSSION: Research can advance greater coordination of these areas by demonstrating their interactions and wider impacts on well-being as well as the potential for programmatic synergies. Integrated solutions to clean households and communities can benefit from the contribution in multiple disciplines, including economics and policy analysis; business and finance; engineering and technology; lab sciences, environmental health, and biomedical sciences; and behavioral and implementation sciences. CONCLUSION: There are compelling reasons to overcome the artificial and unproductive segregation of HAP and WaSH.

As a concept it is emotive but lacks clarity. The first contribution of this paper is to explore and substantiate the concept of local embedding by drawing on three theoretical fields: socio-technical transitions, domestication studies and research on innovation intermediaries. Emphasis is placed on the work required to integrate low carbon technologies into local contexts of use by aligning multiple system elements into configurations that work. This points to a particular form of actor – those performing relational work between multiple actors and technologies, commonly known as intermediaries – as being central to the process. Three key intermediary processes – of facilitating, configuring and brokering - are thought to define the work that intermediary organisations do. Nonetheless, understanding how these key intermediary processes relate as well as the agency of intermediary organisations in local embedding is still largely uncharted territory. The paper's second contribution is the development of a process perspective on the agency of intermediary organisations in local embedding. The resulting perspective offers a means to situate and understand the agency of user-side intermediaries in local embedding and insights into later phases of transition processes.\", authkeywords='Domestication | Innovation intermediaries | Intermediary organisations | Local embedding | Socio-technical transitions', citedby_count=26, openaccess=0, freetoread='repositoryam', freetoreadLabel='Green', fund_acr='ESRC', fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='Economic and Social Research Council'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85056779040', doi='10.1016/j.dss.2018.10.015', pii='S0167923618301726', pubmed_id=None, title='Using agent-based modelling to investigate diffusion of mobile-based branchless banking services in a developing country', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Zaffar M.A.', afid='60218019;60006951', affilname='Suleman Dawood School of Business;The University of North Carolina at Charlotte', affiliation_city='Lahore;Charlotte', affiliation_country='Pakistan;United States', author_count='3', author_names='Zaffar, Muhammad Adeel;Kumar, Ram L.;Zhao, Kexin', author_ids='56032177600;55492134100;14020803900', author_afids='60218019;60006951;60006951', coverDate='2019-02-01', coverDisplayDate='February 2019', publicationName='Decision Support Systems', issn='01679236', source_id='21933', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='117', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='62-74', description='Branchless Banking Services (BBS) were launched in 2009 in Pakistan with the promise of providing banking services to the unbanked.

Energy congestion is classified into undesirable energy congestion (UEC) and desirable energy congestion (DEC) under natural disposability and managerial disposability.

Our empirical analysis revealed: i) The UEC of coal-fired generation industry has occurred in many regions, most of which are less-developed areas. This indicates that energy is wasted in coal-fired generation industry due to congestion inefficiency. ii) DEC has occurred in a few regions and did not occur in 2013.

A new jig-shape optimization method is presented in the current study and its application on the high aspect ratio wing is discussed.

The effect of bending deformation was equivalent to the change of attack angle through a new equivalent method. The equivalent attack angle showed a linear dependence on the quadratic function of bending. Then, a new jig-shape optimization method taking integrated structural deformation into account was proposed. The method was realized by four substeps: object decomposition, optimization design, inversion and evaluation. Findings: After the new jig-shape optimization design, both aerodynamic distribution and structural configuration have satisfactory results. Meanwhile, the method takes both bending and torsion deformation into account. Practical implications: The new jig-shape optimization method can be well used for the high aspect ratio wing.

The management of agricultural engineering should be improved urgently, and the management efficiency should be improved urgently. In agricultural infrastructure engineering, agricultural mechanization engineering, protected agriculture engineering, agricultural products processing and storage engineering, agricultural products circulation engineering, resource and environmental protection engineering, agricultural information engineering and other major agricultural engineerings, management should be innovated by using the integrated methodology. The solution of a series of complex scientific problems in the agricultural engineering management needs the guidance of methodology, which is the integration and development of modern scientific methodology in agricultural engineering management. Focusing on the important demands of rural revitalization, the 'four-all' management system was proposed in this paper, which means the all-systems integration, all-factors integration, all-links optimization and all-department coordination in agricultural engineering. This system was used to analyze 3 key parts of agricultural engineering management which were target management, process management and dynamic control. In target management, various complex environmental factors, such as nature, society, humanity, technology and so on should be considered comprehensively. The overall objectives of agricultural engineering should be continuously controlled, coordinated and optimized. In the process management, considering the multi-department and multi-interest demands of the government, enterprises, scientific research institutions and farmers, emphasis should be placed on engineering practice, incentive and restraint mechanisms should be institutionalized in the whole process of agricultural planning, design, implementation, operation and retirement. In dynamic control, the external risks such as market risk, natural risk, technological risk, financial risk and engineering self risks should be faced, and feed forward control, field control and feedback control should be combined. Finally, specific suggestions on strengthening top-level design of agricultural engineering, division roles and coordination among departments, legislative construction, supervision and evaluation were put forward. This methodology system is expected to provide reference for agricultural engineering management.\", authkeywords='Agricultural engineering | Innovation | Management | Rural revitalization strategy', citedby_count=10, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85056766886', doi='10.1002/polb.24763', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='4D Printing based piezoelectric composite for medical applications', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Grinberg D.', afid='60108154;60017724;60004670;60002092', affilname='Laboratoire de Génie Electrique et Ferro électricité;CHU Lille;The Mount Sinai Hospital;Florida State University', affiliation_city='Villeurbanne;Lille;New York;Tallahassee', affiliation_country='France;France;United States;United States', author_count='6', author_names='Grinberg, Daniel;Siddique, Sabrina;Le, Minh Quyen;Liang, Richard;Capsal, Jean Fabien;Cottinet, Pierre Jean', author_ids='56465589700;57206244137;36698011900;7402178168;22939906300;26646343400', author_afids='60108154-60017724-60004670;60002092;60108154;60002092;60108154;60108154', coverDate='2019-01-15', coverDisplayDate='15 January 2019', publicationName='Journal of Polymer Science, Part B: Polymer Physics', issn='08876266', source_id='25915', eIssn='10990488', aggregationType='Journal', volume='57', issueIdentifier='2', article_number=None, pageRange='109-115', description='Additive manufacturing (AM), otherwise known as three-dimensional (3D) printing, is driving major innovations in many areas, such as engineering, manufacturing, art, education, and medicine.

Recently, one of the actively researched areas lies in the AM of smart materials and structures. Electroactive materials incorporated in 3D printing have given birth to 4D printing, where 3D printed structures can perform as actuating and/or sensing systems, making it possible to deliver electrical signals under external mechanical stimuli and vice versa.

Then, the innovation on material research methodology has become the international new trend of materials research and development. Materials genome technology is considered as a giant leap of materials S&T and the accelerator of new material development. The complexity and randomicity of brazing process make the design and development of brazing materials more complicated and time-consuming than ordinary materials. Materials genome initiative, as a brand new concept for advanced materials development, should also be adopted to the performance optimization and development of new brazing materials. This is of great significance to promote the rapid development of welding technology, especially intelligent welding. The three main facets of materials genome technology are high-throughput material computation, high-throughput material experimentation and material basic data. Large-scale high-throughput computation can provide abundant and systematic data. High-throughput material experimentation can quickly verify these data. Moreover, the establishment of the material database can realize (i) the effective integration of calculated data with experimental data, and (ii) their mutual complementation and mutual verification. These three elements work together and then contribute to a more close relationship between theoretical and experimental research in the process of material development. This can shorten the period of research, manufacturing and application, and reduces the development cost of new materials. In addition to the performance of material itself, developing new brazing materials also need to consider (i) physical and chemical compatibility of brazing materials and base materials, (ii) interaction (diffusion and formation of new phase) between brazing materials and base materials during brazing process. The interaction between brazing materials and base materials is very complex, as it not only depends on the brazing process (temperature, holding time, pressure, atmosphere, etc.), but is directly related to the composition of brazes and base materials. Therefore, compared with ordinary materials, the design and development of brazing materials require a more complicated methodology and a more time-consuming course. And the initiation of brazing materials genome project is of great urgency. This relies to a considerable degree on the satisfactory achievement towards three essential engineering issues, i.e. development of high-throughput computing software, high-throughput experimental methodologies and data integration system. The development of intelligent welding at present has focused mostly on fusion welding, e.g. arc welding, laser welding, etc., and has also acquired notable achievements. However, the full-intelligent control technology for brazing still lies at a fairly primitive level, and the current researches concentrate mainly on brazing equipment and brazing process control. The brazing materials play an important role in intelligent brazing. So the brazing materials genome project can facilitate the intelligentization of brazing technology. In return, the advancement of intelligent brazing will also advance the course of brazing materials genome project, as it will greatly simplify and accelerate the performance examination upon new designed brazes, and in addition, it will help to collect more real-time data for the numerous artificially created brazes.

It also analyzes the influence factors and key common problems for the adoption of materials genome technology to brazing materials development, and states dialectically the mutually reinforcing relationship between brazes genome project and intelligent brazing technology.', authkeywords='Brazes | High-throughput computation | High-throughput experimentation | Intelligent brazing | Material basic data | Materials genome', citedby_count=8, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='NSFC', fund_no='51805112', fund_sponsor='National Natural Science Foundation of China'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85065396573', doi='10.11896/cldb.201901013', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='The State of the Art of Hydrogen Storage Materials for High-pressure Hybrid Hydrogen Vessel', subtype='re', subtypeDescription='Review', creator='Zhou C.', afid='60024542', affilname='South China University of Technology', affiliation_city='Guangzhou', affiliation_country='China', author_count='4', author_names='Zhou, Chao;Wang, Hui;Ouyang, Liuzhang;Zhu, Min', author_ids='57202774889;55966718000;7005138121;57193260039', author_afids='60024542;60024542;60024542;60024542', coverDate='2019-01-10', coverDisplayDate='10 January 2019', publicationName='Cailiao Daobao/Materials Review', issn='1005023X', source_id='21100853795', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='33', issueIdentifier='1', article_number=None, pageRange='117-126', description='Hydrogen energy is one of the most important choices for realizing clean energy because of its wide sources, no pollution, and high energy density. The technological innovation of fuel cells contributes to the attractive prospect of hydrogen energy in vehicles, but the problem of hydrogen filling and hydrogen storage has become one of the obstacles to the development of hydrogen energy cars. The safe and efficient hydrogen storage is crucial for the large-scale application of hydrogen energy. Till now there have been developed three main hydrogen storage methods, which include high-pressure gaseous hydrogen storage, low-temperature liquid hydrogen storage and solid-state hydrogen storage. The gravimetric density of gaseous hydrogen storage system can be promoted by increasing the pressure of hydrogen and the specific strength of container material. However, H2 molecular interaction causes a relatively low volumetric density of gaseous hydrogen storage system, and excessively high hydrogen pressure challenges the safety and heightens design difficulty and cost of hydrogen tanks. The liquid hydrogen storage owns ideal gravimetric and volumetric density, which can be realized by compres-sing and liquefying hydrogen gas. However, liquid hydrogen is particularly prone to volatilize and liquid hydrogen container requires strict storing conditions. In addition, the liquefying process of gaseous hydrogen is uneconomical, as it consumes an energy quantity that constitutes about 40% of the combustion heat release of the stored hydrogen. For the solid-state hydrogen storage, hydrogen is stored in the hydrides in the form of atom or ion. Hence, the solid-state hydrogen storage obtains an impressively high volumetric density and enjoys greater security because the hydrogen storage materials absorb/desorb hydrogen at mild conditions. But the gravimetric density of hydrogen storage materials is comparatively low. The high-pressure hybrid hydrogen storage vessel, which combines the advantages of gaseous and solid-state hydrogen storage methods, offers a feasible path to safe and high-density hydrogen storage. The volumetric density of high-pressure hydrogen tank can be effectively enhanced by the hydrogen storage materials, resulting in lower operating pressure, smaller volume, and higher safety. The performance promotion of the high-pressure hybrid hydrogen storage vessels depends upon the development of materials with excellent hydrogen sorption performances under high hydrogen pressure. The AB2 type ZrFe2-based and TiCr2 based alloys are the currently prevailing high-pressure hydrogen storage materials. Though researchers mainly concentrate on and have achieved the regulation of storage capacity, absorption/desorption pressure plateau and kinetics through the alloying trials which partially substitute elements with various atomic radius and electronic structures for either A-site or B-site, the gravimetric densities of ZrFe2-based and TiCr2-based alloys are still unsatisfactory. NaAlH4 and AlH3 display considerable potential as candidate storage materials owing to their intrinsically high storage density. For NaAlH4, sufficient works have preliminarily confirmed the effectiveness of nanosizing and catalyst-doping toward dehydrogenation temperature reduction and cyclic stability enhancement.

In this paper, an AR app was used in facilitating a lesson on chemical bonding and simple compounds. The effects of such innovation were studied using observation and various data gathering methods in an action research design. Results show that AR is a tool that enhances visualization of concepts through elements of virtual and real images, allows students to map physical characteristics easily and aids them in developing mental images for further discourse. Results also show that AR does not only improve motivation but triggers more student-student interaction and teacher-student interaction as well. Students learning attitudes towards chemistry improved in terms of their appreciation of the subject, their perception of its relation to real life and of their meaning-making processes. The teacher indicated that AR apps can innovate the classroom and can provide opportunities for implementation as they are easy to use. However, findings also show that teachers may have a hard time looking for free resources of apps that will meet their needs, and that there is challenge in ensuring that misconceptions are avoided from AR apps' oversimplification of visualization.

So far, however, in vitro and in vivo applications of UCNPs are restricted to the laboratory use due to safety concerns. Possible harmful effects may originate from the chemical composition but also from the small size of UCNPs. Potential end users must rely on well-founded safety data.

The author provides arguments in favor of the idea that the differentiated character of the structural transformations of scientific-technical societies, as well as the criteria for assessing the effectiveness of their activities, reflected the mobilization model of the Soviet economy. Realizing the mobilization functions that are not inherent in their nature and implementing speculative ideas (democratization of production), scientific-technical societies created far-fetched associations, such as worker-research institutes, public construction bureaus, public bureaus of economic analysis, and others. A key focal point is the analysis of the difficulties faced by scientific-technical associations. The most significant of which were the lack of: independence in planning the trajectory of its development, scientific personnel and effective connections with other scientific and engineering organizations. A large number of mobilization events generated the pursuit of quantity at the expense of quality.

In this case, the fourth challenge on operational scheduling and staffing of the workspace, presented in the syllabus (Crawley, Malmqvist, Östlund, Brodeur, & Edström, 2014) is encountered. To avoid throwing the baby out with the bathwater, this paper captures the value of the space and programming for its users and types of usage, primary and auxiliary. It answers the key question: what needs do the Innovation Playground fulfil for all its users? It focuses on uses beyond the educational and users beyond the engineering domain. Cases and spaces of multidisciplinary education beyond the technical domain are rare to find within the CDIO body of knowledge. The CDIO framework is optimized for engineering education, yet the value of these spaces for members across an institute (such as internal research partners and external network) is overlooked with this perspective. The syllabus touches upon the community building aspects as a result of the design-implementation projects (for students and faculty staff). The valuable activities, as expressed by its users, are teaching and learning modes that contribute to community building, such as advanced and simple design-implementation projects, collaborative design projects, extracurricular design projects, tinkering mode and self-guided learning (Young et al., 2005). For non-student users, this community building value is endorsed.

When students practice inquiry, it helps them develop all the critical skills needed for the 21st century which include problem identification, problem-solving, critical thinking, team working, data analysis, scientific reasoning, decision making, etc. Similarly, a programme known as the Young Researcher Programme (YRP) has been implemented in the School of Engineering at Nanyang Polytechnic, Singapore since 2017 to nurture students’ innovative spirit and develop capabilities in conducting research. In the YRP, students are to form their own teams that consist of members who are from different years of study and engineering disciplines. The purpose is to train students to find ways to collaborate, learn and share knowledge and skillsets with a diverse group of members in the team. The team is then required to conduct independent research, integrate ideas from different resources, support their ideas with evidence, conceptualise and apply relevant principles in designing the experiments or products, implement them under staff supervision, and evaluate the validity and reliability of their conclusions. As the YRP is conducted beyond the formal curriculum hours, students are not bounded by the requirement of the curriculum and are free to work on research projects that are of interest to them. Students in the YRP are also given ample opportunities to attend training and seminars, as well as participate in industry visits. This paper describes how the YRP exposes students to a culture of inquiry-based learning starting from as early as their first year of study at the Polytechnic. This paper also discusses the effectiveness of the YRP in inculcating a research mindset among the students and the usefulness in tracking their individual progress in YRP until their final year of study in the polytechnic. Finally, this paper highlights the challenges faced and provides recommendations for future enhancement of the YRP.', authkeywords='Active Learning | collaborative learning | inquiry-based learning | Standards: 8 | Young Researcher Programme', citedby_count=1, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85150737165', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Innovative engineering project from engineering design to implementation-base on CDIO model', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Liang C.J.', afid='60004879;128942729', affilname='Feng Chia University;National Taiwan University of Sport', affiliation_city='Taichung;', affiliation_country='Taiwan;Taiwan', author_count='5', author_names='Liang, Chen Jui;Shin, Shaw Jyh;Wang, Vey;Teng, Chun Wen;Lee, Yao Chuan', author_ids='57102397300;7403647347;7007164264;55772629600;58153677100', author_afids='60004879;60004879;60004879;128942729;60004879', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2019', publicationName='Proceedings of the International CDIO Conference', issn=None, source_id='21101130994', eIssn='20021593', aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='269-283', description='In the past, the higher education in Taiwan aimed to create elites in the field of engineering. However, the conventional subjects and curriculum taught were mainly focusing on the introduction and understanding of theories. So students who only accept professional theories, the technology developed is not necessarily the needs of the industry, hence affecting the competitiveness of the country. The importance of “Creative Education” was mentioned in many research papers around the world when discussing how to enhance national competitiveness. Feng Chia University is devoted to promote “The Project of Innovative Engineering”. By borrowing the experience of innovative education from Purdue University and combining it with the CDIO model, Feng Chia University created a systematic process for the project of innovative engineering. This allows students to discover and define problems, analyze and simulate actual situations, conceive and invent products, and in the end, achieve product evaluation and innovation development. This paper introduces the procedure of how Feng Chia University integrated the CDIO framework into innovative education, and how, they through curriculum development, encourages students to engage in active learning and gather learning experiences rather than passive note-taking. The results of the current two semesters have shown that by transforming industrial design into a project of innovative engineering really does enhance students’ motivation for active learning. The learning goal and process created based on Bloom’s taxonomy is set to start with “creativity”. Under this guideline, students are willing to learn the contents related to “analysis”, “assessment” and “application” more actively, leading to an outcome of the enhanced ability to “memorize” and “comprehend”. Moreover, by using the CDIO framework to create the project of innovative engineering, it allows teachers to overcome the time limitations which existed in the system before, and at the same time enhances the depth of learning for the students significantly.', authkeywords='Bloom’s taxonomy | Practical skills development | Project-based learning | Self-determination theory | Standards: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8', citedby_count=1, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='MOST', fund_no='105-2511-S-035-011-MY3', fund_sponsor='Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85150644401', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='USE OF BIM IN A REHABILITATION PROPOSAL OF AN INDUSTRIAL HISTORICAL BUILDING WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF A COLLABORATIVE END-DEGREE-PROJECT', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Sánchez Lite A.', afid='60106051;60028711;60024695', affilname='Universidade de Lisboa;Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia;Universidad de Valladolid', affiliation_city='Lisbon;Madrid;Valladolid', affiliation_country='Portugal;Spain;Spain', author_count='5', author_names='Sánchez Lite, Alberto;Zulueta Pérez, Patricia;Torre Agundez, Beatriz;González Gaya, Cristina;Zita Sampaio, Alcínia', author_ids='55001824200;57561488600;58150811600;6504525637;54961053400', author_afids='60024695;60024695;60024695;60028711;60106051', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2019', publicationName='Proceedings from the International Congress on Project Management and Engineering', issn=None, source_id='21101083163', eIssn='26955067', aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description='This essay is part of a process of implementation of the BIM methodology in the Industrial Engineering School of the University of Valladolid, carried out by the teaching team who is author of this proposal.

The “Horseradish Peroxidase” is a glycoprotein that contains an iron porphyrin as an electroactive center that has been widely used as electrochemical biosensors due to its low cost and stable characteristics. Studies on the electrochemical behavior of a bioactive molecule as “Horseradish Peroxidase” have become one of the fastest growing fields, where interest has grown in biomedical engineering and biotechnology in the manufacture of more stable, responsive, accurate and voltammetric/amperometric biosensors. The application of this type of devices involves many fields: cancer diagnosis, water analysis, heavy metal ion detection, and toxicity detection. However, research on the electrochemical communication of redox enzyme immobilized on solid electrodes is one of the principal challenges for the development of electronic applications. This has opened a new route towards bioelectrochemical devices based on enzymes and metallic electrodes that demands more advanced and reliable tools. It includes an appropriate enzyme redox-electrode interface, where an appropriate “matrix” immobilization is essential to study and optimize the electrochemical properties of this kind of devices. This field presents a rapid growth in the design of this type of biosensors that have required the incorporation of nanomaterials. This document presents a review of the research that has been carried out in the development of nanomaterials for the fabrication of enzymes electrochemical sensors that have presented major efficiency for the immobilization and effective communication of “Horseradish Peroxidase” with the electrodic surface and its application for the precise detection of different important analytes (Peroxides, phenolic compounds and nitrides). In this review, the general voltammetric techniques are addressed and how these techniques are useful for the biosensitivity and detection of these devices, together with the important details and concepts around them, such as sensitivity and detection limits.

This shift is also reflected in emerging research priorities that are most frequently conceived in STEM terms, underpinned by commitments to internationalization and multidisciplinarity. This chapter explores STEM policies and programs from an international perspective extending from the Anglosphere, East Asia, Western Europe and Latin America to the Middle East.

The chapter examines various programs and solutions including school-level curriculum and pedagogy reform to enhance science and mathematics participation and performance, teaching-related initiatives, and strategies at the tertiary-level to redress current systemic disparities.', authkeywords=None, citedby_count=62, openaccess=0, freetoread='repositoryvor', freetoreadLabel='Green', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85140939218', doi='10.1002/9781119517283', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Managing technology and product development programmes: A framework for success', subtype='bk', subtypeDescription='Book', creator='Flinn P.', afid='127954667', affilname='Db Ashbourne Limited', affiliation_city='Ashbourne', affiliation_country='United Kingdom', author_count='1', author_names='Flinn, Peter', author_ids='57948426600', author_afids='127954667', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='1 January 2019', publicationName='Managing Technology and Product Development Programmes: A Framework for Success', issn=None, source_id='21101117414', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Book', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='1-280', description='An authoritative guide to new product development for early career engineers and engineering students. Managing Technology and Product Development Programmes provides a clear framework and essential guide for understanding how research ideas and new technologies are developed into reliable products which can sold successfully in the private or business marketplace. Drawing on the author’s practical experience in a variety of engineering industries, this important book fills a gap in the product development literature. It links back into the engineering processes that drives the actual creation of products and represents the practical realisation of innovation. Comprehensive in scope, the book reviews all elements of new product development. The topics discussed range from the economics of new product development, the quality processes, prototype development, manufacturing processes, determining customer needs, value proposition and testing. Whilst the book is designed with an emphasis on engineered products, the principles can be applied to other fields as well. This important resource: • Takes a holistic approach to new product development. • Links technology and product development to business needs. • Structures technology and product development from the basic idea to the completed off-the-shelf product. • Explores the broad range of skills and the technical expertise needed when developing new products. • Details the various levels of new technologies and products and how to track where they are in the development cycle.

It consists of rovings made out of thousands of filaments. To improve bond performance these textiles are impregnated afterwards with either reactive resins (mainly epoxy resin) or aqueous dispersions (mainly styrene butadiene or styrene-acrylate copolymers). Experiments carried out at the Institute of Structural Engineering at TU Wien showed the high potential of structural elements reinforced with epoxy impregnated textile reinforcement. However a spalling of the concrete cover due to high bond stresses could be observed in most cases, subsequently leading to premature failure of the test specimens. Based on this observation further tests on the bond performance of textile reinforcement bonded in high performance concrete were carried out using a special bond performance test adapted for textile reinforcement in particular. The research described in this paper shows that the roving geometry and the production process of the textile reinforcement is responsible for high splitting forces orthogonal to the textile layer, resulting in a spalling of the concrete cover.

Physical products, as with organisms, have a life cycle, starting with extraction of raw materials, and including refining, transport, manufacturing, use, and finally end-of-life treatment and disposal. LCA is a quantitative modeling framework that can estimate emissions that occur throughout a product’s life cycle, as well as any harmful effects that these emissions have on the environment and/or public health. Importantly, LCA tools allow engineers to evaluate multiple types of environmental and health impacts simultaneously and are not limited to a single endpoint or score.

In order to reduce product waste and production time and to increase the flexibility of tablet production, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), among others, promotes research and innovations in the field of continuous production for the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals. The QbCon®1 unit developed by L.B. Bohle Maschinen +Verfahren GmbH is one of the research field innovations [2]. The plant combines all three necessary process steps of continuous raw material dosing (premix of excipients and active ingredients), twin-screw wet granulation and fluid bed drying to enable continuous wet granulation and drying of the tableting mixture. In this article, the continuous fluid bed dryer is firstly presented. Subsequently, a continuum based model is developed for the drying process. The aim is to develop a model that can be used for model-based product quality control. From a control engineering point of view, this is a multi-variable problem, since different process variables (e.g. drying air temperature, air mass flow, conveying speed of the granules) have an influence on the drying process. The control of the Process Variables (PVs) is carried out with the aid of standard industrial PID controllers. The tuning and validation of PVs controllers is based on empirical investigations or using developed actuation models. Finally, a concept for the control of one of the process main critical quality attributes (CQAs), namely the tablet mixture moisture content, is presented with the aid of a model based controller approach. The model constructed for the drying process has shown a good match to the real process with a maximum of 1.18% prediction standard deviation from the experimentally measured mean moisture content. Moreover, the model based controller approach feasibility is demonstrated using a closed loop simulation of an implemented Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC).', authkeywords=None, citedby_count=2, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85104688664', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Topology optimization in rotorcraft applications', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Dudziak J.', afid='60011769', affilname='Łukasiewicz - Instytut Lotnictwa', affiliation_city='Warsaw', affiliation_country='Poland', author_count='6', author_names='Dudziak, Jacek;Gawlik, Arkadiusz;Guła, Pawel;Tabor, Marek;Ulma, Dawid;Zurawski, Rafal', author_ids='57196045439;57196048286;56341337100;57223084775;57192228947;57192233524', author_afids='60011769;60011769;60011769;60011769;60011769;60011769', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2019', publicationName='45th European Rotorcraft Forum 2019, ERF 2019', issn=None, source_id='21101043353', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume='1', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='360-366', description=\"To introduce a new design nowadays the engineer has to show, that it provides a significant leap in performance improvement, not only a minor step.

Among present and potential numerous and diverse applications of IoT, its utilization in the energy sector is of particular interest. The IoT inclusion in the power industry and Smart Grid (SG) evolution opens a whole world of high-potential opportunities to optimize the grid operation. The realization of SGs utilizing smart metering technology or advanced metering infrastructure with bidirectional IoT-based communication between demand and utility could improve existing energy balancing procedures. Keeping energy consumption and supply in balance with minimal operating costs and optimal grid conditions is not an easy task, especially in presence of renewable energy sources. As the IoT is established on the utilization of a large number of smart things/devices that generate a prodigious amount of data on a daily basis, successfully managing big data represents a key issue. In order to obtain valuable insights and knowledge from data gathered, the appliance of big data analytics is demanded. Hence, effective analysis and utilization of a massive amount of diversity of data that arrive at high speed and can be of uncertain provenance are mandatory in the process of obtaining valuable insights and enable the creation of knowledge-based recommender systems. Big data analytics applied to data gathered from smart meters could be used to make valuable recommendations regarding consumption prediction, demand response and management programs, voltage and frequency control, state estimation, and power quality. The overall operation of SG could be certainly optimized in various aspects by using large-scale near real-time measurements.

This is somewhat surprising given that value creation lies at the core of any business and nearly all of the engineers observed were working for business enterprises. This initial observation led us to examine what turned out to be relatively sparse literature relating to engineering value, how the value of engineering work is perceived within the context of entrepreneurship and innovation research and how students are introduced to this in engineering education programs and entrepreneurship courses. We were led to conclude that the concept of value creation makes only a tenuous and indistinct appearance at the far periphery of engineering discourse. Given the critical importance of business investment for almost all engineering enterprises, it is surprising that the research literature is almost silent on this issue. In the study we identify ways that engineers create and protect value that are not usually mentioned in the innovation-centred approach typical of entrepreneurship research and education emanating from Schumpeter’s early twentieth century ideas that still shape business and economics today. We hypothesize that this lack of awareness of value creation by engineers may be associated with low success rates of major engineering capital expansion projects such as process plants, infrastructure construction, and defence equipment acquisitions. Furthermore, it could help to explain some of the everyday frustrations encountered by engineers, employers and investors in engineering enterprises and low rates of productivity improvement in developing countries.', authkeywords='Economics | Engineering education | Engineering philosophy | Engineering practice | Entrepreneurship | Value creation', citedby_count=5, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='Australian Government'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85101596129', doi='10.1007/978-3-319-99636-3_10', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Industry and the Development of a New System of Higher Technological Education in the UK 1955–1965: A Shared Responsibility?', subtype='ch', subtypeDescription='Book Chapter', creator='Heywood J.', afid='60011149', affilname='Trinity College Dublin', affiliation_city='Dublin', affiliation_country='Ireland', author_count='1', author_names='Heywood, John', author_ids='57203302493', author_afids='60011149', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2019', publicationName='Philosophy of Engineering and Technology', issn='18797202', source_id='21101039103', eIssn='18797210', aggregationType='Book Series', volume='32', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='187-206', description='There is a continuing conflict between education and industry that begins with the different perceptions that educators and industrialists have of the purposes of tertiary education through to university study.

While only a developing region, a de-facto state, can technology be developed that will allow North Cyprus to develop as an area of smart tourism? This paper will higlight the technology needed, as well as the new business models this will entail. The research methodology begins with a qualitative survey. in the form of unstructured interviews with a small number of entrepreneurs in the region, with the aim of undestanding the entreprenuers’ perceptions of smart technology, and whether they see a role for it in the future of their business, and the region. It is planned to used mixed methods, and to follow up the themes and questions raised by the interviews, with a quantiative survey to be administered to around 300 entreprenuers around the island. A quantitative survey will also bring forth the amount of understanding of smart technology in the region, as well as the role of sustainable entrepreneurship and smart technology. The initial results from the interviews reveal that entrepreneurs are not familiar with the term smart tourism, yet they can see some benefits of the adoption of smart tourism in Cyprus. The evaluation of the interviews indicate that entrepreneurs, while unsure about the availability of smart technology, were keen to learn more about the technology, and possibly to innovate and take advantage of this new technology.

To publish quality papers with scopus index based on the experience of Course Projects which are explored through Project Based Learning. This was considered in third semester MTech. Since the time is too short and is only 12 weeks, we have come up with many ideas and used new innovative process to publish papers in International Conference with Scopus Index. The main purpose is to train the MTech students to publish quality papers in International Conferences / Journals with scopus index through course projects. To publish quality papers with scopus index, based on the experience of course projects require lot of in-depth knowledge, choosing tools and making use of the latest technology. Imparting this knowledge is challenging and is achieved through project based learning. Choosing the latest area was the first challenge. Internet of Things (IoT) was a course in third semester MTech and was selected as the theme for Course Projects and it was compulsory. The students were given a chance to choose a project in the area of their interest under IoT. After selecting a project, optimal and feasible solution has to be selected with innovation. The students as a team have to learn and give a solution to the problem and it should be such that the work carried out should be able to publish the paper in an International Conference / Journals. There were nineteen students in the class and five teams were made out of nineteen students. The target of each team is to publish one scopus indexed paper in International Conference / Journal. All the five teams are able to achieve the goal set and is discussed in the results below. All the five teams formed are able to submit the papers to IEEE International Conference on Advances in Information Technology 2019 (ICAIT2019) and all the papers have been accepted and presented, three will be published in IEEE Explore and two will be published in UGC Referred INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN ELECTRONICS AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING (IJRECE) and all are scopus indexed. It has been a practice to teach a course with emphasis on theory. In this approach a course project was insisted by selecting a problem and giving an IoT solution to the problem. The five teams formed are able to publish five scopus indexed papers one per team and are able to get in-depth knowledge about the course taught.

To better understand the implications of technology convergence relevant to aviation, NASA sponsored a study to (1) develop and demonstrate a repeatable methodology to identify areas of potential technology convergence impacting the future of aviation, and (2) explore the potential impact of converging technologies on selected future aeronautical concepts. The methodology applied cluster analysis and text mining techniques to identify candidate technologies, including those outside of traditional aviation sources, and their potential for application in four areas. The results were reviewed by subject matter experts and in structured workshops to rank technologies of interest and provide recommendations relevant to NASA research plans. The four areas were covered in successive cycles addressing on-demand mobility, control of airflow to reduce air vehicle noise, advanced concepts for vertical takeoff and landing propulsion, and advanced technologies for future air traffic management. The study demonstrated that searching for technologies with potential for convergence is an iterative process – each search leads to deeper searches, different areas to be explored, or new questions.

Nonetheless, United Launch Alliance (ULA) recently developed a 6-cylinder ICE to be used in their Centaur 3rd Stage. Its function is 3-fold: (1) rotary power will drive an electrical generator; (2) “waste” heat will be used to pressurize the liquid hydrogen (LH2) and liquid oxygen tanks (LO2); (3) the exhaust will be vented out a rocket nozzle to provide settling of the LH2/LO2 tanks. The total efficiency of the system is expected to approach 100%. The mass savings is expected to be on the order of 1 tonne. Another application of chemically powered ICEs in outer space could be serving as range extenders for lunar polar exploration rovers designed to operate in permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) of the Moon, or during the 2-week long night in illuminated regions. Exploring PSRs represents a tremendous engineering challenge. Permanently shaded Whipple Crater—notable because it is adjacent to a large plateau of quasi-permanent illumination suitable for a crewed outpost—has 30° slopes. Since current rover designs can safely navigate slopes less than 15° to 20°, a Resource Prospector Mission (RPM) design where a solar powered rover makes short sorties into the PSR only to climb out to recharge its batteries is not practicable. To explore Whipple Crater, the rover would have to land within the interior of the crater. Assuming this could be done, any solar panels would be useless. Therefore, a prospecting rover would be required to carry with it all energy required for the mission. To explore this possibility, we undertook preliminary engineering calculations based on the clean-sheet SonicFlow™ (SF) 2-stroke engine prototyped by Technology Elevated LLC. The engine incorporates two main innovations: (1) it uses the Kadenacy effect—reverberating sound waves—to pump the fuel-air mixture and remove exhaust gases on both the outlet and the inlet of the combustion chamber; and (2) the SF design incorporates a specifically designed centrifugal impeller, contained within the crankcase, that functions as a supercharger and isolates the fuel-air mixture from the lubricating oil. Consequently, the SF, like large diesel 2-stroke engines used in railroad locomotives, does not burn oil, yet the SF retains the simplicity of the traditional 2-stroke small engine. There are no valve trains, camshafts, or pumps. Under atmospheric conditions, the prototype SF achieved volumetric efficiencies measured at 120%. Measured thermal efficiency is 40%--unprecedented for such a small engine, and a best in class specific power of 2.1 kW/kg. Our model assumed an RPM sized rover of 100 kg with a 30 kg mass budget for an ICE-electrical hybrid power plant, and an average 200 W power. Assuming a 5 kg margin, after accounting for tankage, 10% boiloff of LH2, ~19 kg of LH2/LO2 could potentially power the rover for about 5.8 days; methane, with lower boiloff rates, could last close to 5 days, compared to a lithium battery-only design of only 2.6 days. A fuel cell (FC) system could have a somewhat higher thermal efficiency (~50%), but a much lower specific power. Consequently, given the strict mass constraints we assume, an FC system might be expected to produce a marginally better loiter time of 6.1 days. Considering the overall trade space, however, we believe an SF-ICE system could prove to be the superior choice due to better simplicity, reliability, cost, and ability to provide direct rotary power to the rover subsystems. The SF-ICE is also extremely fuel flexible and tolerant of fuel impurities. This capability could potentially allow refueling from the residual propellants left on the landing module, thus radically extending total loiter time.', authkeywords=None, citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85093488539', doi='10.1016/B978-0-12-817931-4.00012-1', pii='B9780128179314000121', pubmed_id=None, title='Future prospects and challenges', subtype='ch', subtypeDescription='Book Chapter', creator='Niebur G.L.', afid='60155914', affilname='College of Engineering', affiliation_city='Notre Dame', affiliation_country='United States', author_count='1', author_names='Niebur, Glen L.', author_ids='7003447906', author_afids='60155914', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='1 January 2019', publicationName='Mechanobiology: From Molecular Sensing to Disease', issn=None, source_id='21101023520', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Book', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='221-227', description='A number of key innovations are enabling more sophisticated mechanobiological studies to be performed.

This paper argues for combining the forces of design science research and ontology studies to foster knowledge creation and evolution.

A special issue for occupational accidents in the construction industry is the use of scaffolds, which is usually attributed to falls from height. Research and practice have demonstrated that decisions made upstream from the construction site can influence construction worker safety. Therefore, it is crucial to assess the risk levels for different construction stages on scaffolding, with various work trades, aiming to prevent the occurrence of fall accidents. The use of new techniques and methodologies, such as Building Information Modeling (BIM), is of major importance. The growing implementation of BIM in Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) is changing the way safety can be approached. This study reviews the existing literature about BIM and construction safety on scaffolding, to explore useful findings and detect knowledge gaps for future research.

From a marketing perspective, the role of innovation in an organization is to create a steady stream of new products and services that meets the needs of customers. The role of marketing is to carry the voice of the customer into the organization, in order to infuse decisions with this customer-centric perspective. The marketing discipline offers a number of different lenses through which innovation is studied, including a customer lens (e.g., factors that affect customers' decisions to adopt innovation and different categories of adopters; the rate and trajectory of adoption and diffusion of innovations; various research protocols and tools to study customer needs and perceptions of innovation; and the intersection of innovation and consumption from a cultural perspective); a company lens (e.g., the new product development process, product launch strategies, the interactions between marketing personnel and engineering/R&D personnel in the innovation process, marketing strategy including first-mover advantages, the role of organizational culture and market orientation in innovation and innovation performance, and how various types of innovations require different market strategies); an inter-firm relationship lens (including the role of suppliers, alliance/partners, channel retailers and distributors, and innovation ecosystem partners); and the lens of the broader market environment (such as government labs, industry consortia, etc.). In addition, this section identifies future opportunity areas where marketing can offer its distinctive perspective on innovation, including, for example, the role of social influencers in adoption of innovation; data-driven innovation; new types of innovation (reverse innovation, sustainable innovation, social innovation, and business model innovation); platform innovations/ innovation ecosystems; and biomimicry.\", authkeywords='Biomimicry | Customer-driven innovation | Data-driven innovation | Innovation | Innovation ecosystems | Innovation performance | Marketing | Platform innovations | Sustainable innovations', citedby_count=1, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85090808051', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='From lab to internship and back again: Learning autonomous systems through creating a research and development ecosystem', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Bihl T.', afid='60019228;123221156', affilname='Air Force Research Laboratory;Key W Corporation', affiliation_city='Dayton;Dayton', affiliation_country='United States;United States', author_count='6', author_names='Bihl, Trevor;Jenkins, Todd;Cox, Chadwick;DeMange, Ashley;Hill, Kerry;Zelnio, Edmund', author_ids='22956785400;57206459589;57202454680;57218825181;42961388100;6602490544', author_afids='60019228;60019228;123221156;60019228;60019228;60019228', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2019', publicationName='33rd AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AAAI 2019, 31st Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence Conference, IAAI 2019 and the 9th AAAI Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence, EAAI 2019', issn=None, source_id='21101021490', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='9635-9643', description='As research and development (R&D) in autonomous systems progresses further, more interdisciplinary knowledge is needed from domains as diverse as artificial intelligence (AI), bi-ology, psychology, modeling and simulation (M&S), and robotics.

Byzantine fault tolerance is intimately linked to engineering and design challenges of developing long-running and safety-critical technical systems. Its origins can be traced back to the question of howto dealwith faulty sensors in distributed systems and the fundamental insight that majority voting schemes may be insufficient to guarantee correctness if arbitrary, or so-called Byzantine failures, can occur. However, achieving resilience against Byzantine failures has its price, both in terms of the redundancy required within a system and the incurred communication overhead. Together with the complexity of correctly implementing Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocols, it may help to explain why BFT systems have not yet been widely deployed in practice, even though practical designs exist for almost 20 years. On the other hand, asking anyone about Bitcoin or blockchain 10 years ago would have only raised quizzical looks. Since then, the ecosphere surrounding blockchain technologies has grown from the pseudonymously published proposal for a peer-to-peer electronic cash system into a multi-billion-dollar industry. At the heart of this success story lies not only the technical innovations presented by Bitcoin but a colorful and diverse community that has succeeded in bridging gaps and bringing together various disciplines from academia and industry alike. Bitcoin reinvigorated interest in the topic of BFT as it was arguably the first system that achieved a practical form of Byzantine fault tolerance with a large and changing number of participants. Research into the fundamental principles and mechanisms behind the underlying blockchain technology of Bitcoin has since helped advance the field and state of the art regarding BFT protocols. This chapter will outline how these modern blockchain technologies relate to the field of Byzantine fault tolerance and outline advantages and disadvantages in their design decisions and fundamental assumptions. Thereby, we highlight that Byzantine fault tolerance should be considered a practical and fundamental building block for modern long-running and safety critical systems and that the principles, mechanisms, and blockchain technologies themselves could help improve the security and quality of such systems.', authkeywords='Bitcoin | Blockchain | Byzantine fault tolerance | Distributed ledger technologies | Distributed systems', citedby_count=15, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85089633188', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Artificial intelligence engineering for postsecondary education digital transformation', subtype='bk', subtypeDescription='Book', creator='Pérez Gama J.A.', afid='116304313', affilname='Fundación de Educación Superior San José', affiliation_city='San Jose', affiliation_country='Colombia', author_count='3', author_names='Pérez Gama, Jesús Alfonso;Rozo Pardo, Luis Giovanni;Gutiérrez Martínez, Luis Carlos', author_ids='55318910700;36998907500;57218578275', author_afids='116304313;116304313;', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='1 January 2019', publicationName='Artificial Intelligence Engineering for Postsecondary Education Digital Transformation', issn=None, source_id='21101019895', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Book', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='1-228', description='We present conceptual foundations for artificial intelligence, expert systems, and knowledge engineering and management and discuss high quality in education.

The pillars of the architecture are funding, research, entrepreneurship and social projection (Chapter 8); recognizing from the start that knowledge has its ethos in the university; these pillars correspond to: • Productive ecosystem of the DT • DT that enhances knowledge and innovation in the universities for the habilitation of the digital capabilities • A new economy that requires the U transformation as social projection. • New DT human talent required by the new knowledge and intelligence industry. The student hyper-personalization by competences and skills is required. Ten Views of Our DT Model, given its complex process that takes place in long ways, a process required for the successful survival of an organization into the IV Industrial Revolution, with the final purpose of being very competitive, productive and of high quality (HQ). The DT views, namely: 1- The DT Ecosystem. 2- The structural vision or the pillars of the DT mentioned. 3- The DT strategic map, showing scenarios, actors and vision-mission. 4- The architectural components for DT: 8 architectures were developed and implemented, applying some intelligent constructs that we have developed and documented in the last 10 years at FESSANJOSE (U. San José), leading DT in postsecondary education (PSEd). 5- Digital 360° architecture of DT Academy and Administration LOCUS: this architecture is the digital portfolio that implies the organization of the subsystems to obtain better and/or new functionalities based on knowledge to obtain an intelligent behavior. The DT multilayer-architecture approach is a system of systems (SoS) one, which ensures compliance with government policies, norms and standards, in a highly complex social institution with digital assets; this approach describes the subsystems at a higher level, where a system is composed, and with the protocols by which the subsystems communicate. It provides a 360° business vision map and a planning framework for commercial and technological changes. 6- The computational-mathematical perspective of DT, identifying endogenous and exogenous variables and their interrelations. 7- The synthesis, the Matrix of End-Means (EMM) that summarizes in DT: Where the HE is. In addition, where can the HE go? 8- The MIR Matrix, which describes DT Objectives, impacts-indicators and results. 9- The dynamic model of the DT system, based on computational intelligence, representing the system information control of all the components to achieve the completion of the DT. The intelligent management information system (iMIS) for PSEd, shows the dynamics of DT, integrating several multilevel system hybrid architectures, as a space to respond to the solution of the HE problems, tending to the desired competitiveness, specifically pointing out the way that these modern technologies can be included for their adaptation and evolution in PSEd in post-modernity, making governability, and teaching and student productivity compatible with educational high quality, the purpose of DT.

The results showed that with the modifications as done in this research there is about 18.93% increase in the strain energy loading capacity of a member by introducing a straight section in the beam while maintaining the end points same as for the original thin curve member under test.', authkeywords='ANSYS | Curved | Finite element method | Straight section | Strain energy', citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='BEC', fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='Basaveshwar Engineering College'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85088773393', doi='10.35199/epde2019.43', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Embedding creativity in engineering degree programmes', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Finlay J.', afid='60028355', affilname='Liverpool John Moores University', affiliation_city='Liverpool', affiliation_country='United Kingdom', author_count='2', author_names='Finlay, Jamie;Papworth, Adam', author_ids='36608066800;57211283292', author_afids='60028355;60028355', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2019', publicationName='Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Towards a New Innovation Landscape, E and PDE 2019', issn=None, source_id='21100932445', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description='According to Lucas and Hanson [1] in a paper that formed the basis of a report by the Royal Academy of Engineering, engineering education now stifles, and indeed suppresses the creative and innovative capacities of students at a time when the UK Government [2] maintains innovation is key to delivering prosperity.

Prefabrication has not been widely used for permanent school infrastructure, but this recently changed in response to unprecedented increases in student numbers. Permanent prefabrication is currently being commissioned by Australia's two largest state education departments to quickly roll-out quality infrastructure. These multi-billion-dollar government school programs represent a major opportunity for step changes in the nation's construction industry with the potential for a shift from off-site conventional construction towards off-site manufacturing and mass customisation. The scale of the program has the potential to catalyse investment for cutting edge design performance, mass customisation ability and the adoption of digital engineering including building information modelling across the life-cycle. The programs could also leverage recent research into learning environments for changing pedagogies. This paper provides contextual data on prefabrication in Australia and argues a case for prefabrication being conceptualised and evaluated not only in terms of construction innovation but also as a design conversation with users.

Evidence suggests a worldwide increase of cross-disciplinary working as partnerships transcend the confines of predefined and historical silos. However, associations between design, engineering and many branches of life science, lags. While there is increasing interest in bioinspired design, formalised methods are not, as yet, well established, adopted in industry or part of design curricula. Biomimicry as a route to innovation is currently thought to rely on the collaboration between the diverse disciplines of biology, design and engineering in order to be successful. However, current academic research into multidisciplinary collaboration within engineering and product design education appears limited. This study describes the findings of a small-scale research project exploring the attitudes of professionals in relevant fields regarding interdisciplinary collaboration with a specific focus on biomimicry. The work compares current views on collaborative work in biomimicry with the opinions of an expert panel. Two rounds of questionnaires utilising the Delphi method were used to gain insights from an anonymised panel of experts. The research concluded that while biologist/designer collaboration can spark imagination and enthusiasm, it is a challenging process and its efficacy will depend upon understanding and motivation from the onset. The discussion and conclusions focus on the need for more efficient methods to encourage successful collaboration across life sciences and the impact on design education at HE and beyond.

In the broadest sense, the term ‘prototype’ may mean different things, and be the means to different ends. Prototypes play a significant role in idea generation in the early stages of design projects and can act as a catalyst for innovation in a collaborative setting. Successful prototypes are thoughtful about their purpose and context of usage. This makes it important to understand how attributes of the prototype and the prototyping process affect the design process. The landscape of design is evolving– increasingly efficient and sophisticated technology is used in the prototyping process. Multiple stakeholders and end-users are involved throughout the design process, which makes collaborative prototyping and co-creation a valuable activity. The objective of this project is to utilise such an understanding to improve the tools and technologies to better support design teams through their process. Secondary source research and semi-structured interviews with designers have been conducted to understand the challenges faced and to investigate the attributes of prototyping such as modality (physical versus digital), fidelity (high versus low), materials and processes used, effort and time spent, and their effect on the process. Throughout a dynamic design process, prototyping can be a part of different phases of a project, can involve different sets of stakeholders, and can need to perform in different ways.

Through ethically aware design methodologies that postgraduate cross discipline students developed through workshops, this paper outlines and discusses possible directions and methods that design, and engineering education could evolve with further study. What can ethics awareness in postgraduate education trigger and how can it influence future design and engineering practice? For the major role morality and ethics have in ruling social coexistence designers and engineers are called to take responsibility of any action that shapes behaviour between people, products and systems. To respond to the need of a collective ethical etiquette that products and systems can encode, design research at the Royal College of Art has been supporting a practice that acknowledges impacts and people’s responsibilities. A series of workshops will describe the role of collaboration and engagement in drawing ethically aware design and engineering processes; it will be evidenced how these are strategic in modulating relationships and behaviours and in guiding the mapping of the interactions of people with people and machines to acknowledge roles, responsibilities and the ownership of decision making. The intention of this paper is not to draw conclusions on what ethics is and how it should be practiced, but to support the development of guidelines that can engage design and engineering education and industry with debates on responsibilities and decision making across the lifecycle of a product, system, service or infrastructure. This paper intends to be an engaged, collegial and collaborative contribution to the topic of ethics in design/engineering education and practice.', authkeywords='Collaboration | Design methods | Engineering | Ethics | Future of education | Future of practice in design | Innovation | Responsibility', citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85084012337', doi='10.13031/aim.201901274', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Stakeholder mapping of controlled environment agriculture utilizing the technological innovation system framework', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Smith R.J.', afid=None, affilname=None, affiliation_city=None, affiliation_country=None, author_count='2', author_names='Smith, Ronald J.;Stwalley, Robert M.', author_ids='57196049633;6507717360', author_afids=None, coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2019', publicationName='2019 ASABE Annual International Meeting', issn=None, source_id='21100931211', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description='Year round demand for fresh produce in the US is met by the modern food distribution system. To meet growing consumer demand, engineered solutions must efficiently use material resources and space, and be widely applicable. Controlled environment agriculture (CEA) offers the potential to supplement food production through precision management of plant-growth related factors by increasing resource use efficiencies and product quality. To date, little work has analyzed the role that public and private stakeholders play in CEA innovation and technology diffusion. The goal of this research was to conceptualize CEA from a multidimensional stakeholder perspective and to identify opportunities and challenges that influence technological potential, decision-making, and consumer acceptance. To develop a common engineering focus, a stakeholder needs assessment that included inclusive design and management, site suitability, assembly, acceptability, and utilization was required. A framework was developed to characterize CEA actors by utilizing the technological innovation systems (TIS) framework as an analytical lens. Stakeholder mapping identified relevant actors and groups, analyzed perspectives and interests, and visually represented relationships to missions/objectives and other actors, while prioritizing relevant issues. Results showed that CEA was mostly perceived as a commercial activity as opposed to a social one. Opportunities and barriers linked to CEA were categorized as technical, economic, environmental, and social. The common engineering focus surrounding CEA stakeholders included: food production, product enhancement, materials management, reducing resource consumption, and reducing waste.

Yet, the sector has a reputation for being conservative and reluctant to adopt new technology with companies sometimes referred to as \"fast followers\". Compared to other sectors, O&G has a set of unique characteristics that has the potential to hinder technology adoption. Research in other industries indicates that there is a range of sector, organizational and psychological factors that can hinder the introduction of new technologies. Evidence from O&G industry bodies indicate that the psychological factors play a key role in technology adoption; not surprisingly, as workers, managers, investors and regulators can all have a powerful influence on an organisation\\'s receptivity to new technology. The psychological factors do not appear to be well understood but may include risk aversion (Wood Review, 2014), lack of ownership and leadership around technology (OGTC, 2018), and an attitude of reluctance to change (Oil and Gas Authority, 2018). This new research project is designed to examine how the particular attributes of the upstream oil and gas industry on the United Kingdom Continental Shelf interact with the underlying psychological processes that govern adoption and deployment decisions. The presentation will first outline what can be learned from about the psychological factors that influence technology innovation and adoption from the broader consumer behaviour and human factors literatures. Then the preliminary results of an interview study with stakeholders involved in technology innovation and adoption on the UKCS, will be reported. Roles include senior managers, innovation leads, and end users from a spectrum of established and new comer companies.

Understanding the current status of basic research in this field can provide reference for developing corresponding development strategies. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate China's basic research current status in the field of tissue engineering. METHODS: A computer-based online search of Pubmed was performed to retrieve basic research papers and top papers in the field of tissue engineering using search terms MESH terms AND free-text word. In the context of global background, China’s ability of basic research in the field of tissue engineering was analyzed based on the number of papers, the growth of the number of papers, the number and proportion of top papers. In addition, the number of papers was used to identify the global research hotspots in the field of tissue engineering. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The top five countries in the field of tissue engineering were the United States, China, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom. The total number of papers in this field published by Chinese scholars reached 17,031, second only to the United States. The compound annual growth rate of the number of papers was 19.9%, and the number of top papers was 195, ranking first and last among the top five countries, respectively. Eight Chinese institutions ranked top 30 in the number of papers in this field, with an average growth rate of 21.2%, far higher than that of all the top 30 institutions in the world (21.2% vs. 14.2, P < 0.001). However, Chinese institutions produced fewer top papers as compared to other top institutions, with the proportion of top papers significantly lower than that of the average level of the top 30 institutions (2.0% vs. 5.2%; P=0.002). There were five Chinese researchers whose total publications entered top 25 of the world. China's research in tissue engineering focuses on the areas of bone and cartilage, nerves, liver, skin, heart and eye tissue engineering, which is consistent with the global status. China's basic research in the field of tissue engineering ranks second in the world and expands rapidly in recent years. A number of academic institutions and individuals with great achievements have emerged. However, China's research quality in this field is relatively low as compared to other top institutions. It is suggested to guide researchers to pay more attention to the quality and transformation of research output, and to support the development of basic subjects such as material science to lay a good foundation for the development of tissue engineering in China.\", authkeywords='Basic research | Bibliometrics | Innovation power | Medical device | Research hotspot | Scientific paper | Tissue engineering | Top paper', citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='CAMS', fund_no='2018PT33008', fund_sponsor='Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85083823559', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Entrepreneurship with social and territorial relevance.

How to repair is always a problem. Because distraction osteogenesis has the advantages of small trauma, avoiding bone grafting, and prolonging the synchronization of surrounding soft tissue, it holds critical role in increasing alveolar bone mass, prolonging jaw bone, repairing bone defect, and closing bone gap. OBJECTIVE: To summarize and discuss the technical methods, application, limitations and development trends of various curved distractors. METHODS: Relevant articles published from January 2000 to October 2018 were retrieved from CNKI, WanFang, PubMed and Embase databases and National Intellectual Property Office Patent Search and Analysis Platform.

Fifty-eight eligible articles were included for review. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) The early distraction osteogenesis devices are mostly external unidirectional distractors. With the development of various technologies, various intra-oral distractors, such as spiral distractor, curve distractor, bidirectional distractor, three-focus distractor and automatic distractor. (2) In view of the special anatomical shape of the jaw, there are many arc-faced structures. In order to make the new bone closer to the contour shape of the jaw, curved distraction osteogenesis has gradually become a research hotspot. (3) Although the existing curved distractors provide a reliable technical means for jaw defects, they still have a certain degree of limitation. Due to the existence of problems such as traction and force, the true meaning curve and even the three-dimensional distraction are not completed.

Traditional approaches utilizing mutagenesis, whether chemical and/or physical, are incompetent and time consuming, hence utilization of rational strategies to amend cellulase production is worth seeking. Consequently, all-inclusive research is challenging metabolic flexibility and the adaptive potential of prokaryotes. Trapping and investigation of genetic architecture of novel microorganisms for cellulolytic enzymes and their expression in heterologous and homologous systems with highly precise activities and superior proficiencies is in progress. Affluent cloning of cellulases encoding genes from microbes and their expression analysis can result in the paramount upsurge in the usage of sustainable natural resources for development of low-cost efficacious industrial applications.

Open innovation highlights the concept of networking as enterprises position themselves in an inside and outside double process of knowledge acquisition and diffusion to foster their own new activities development and possibly those of their partners. This co-innovation approach may involve close known partners (customers, suppliers, regular interlocutors among others), entities purposely contacted (this includes academic structures specifically associated to a project, distant companies holding complementary know how and start-ups) and also occasional or fuzzy contributors (members of social networks, specialist mobilized by internet innovation intermediaries among others). Open innovation is associated with some theoretical problematic including the question of the necessary abilities of people in charge of this process. Beyond the technology and business competencies required within any innovation process, this paper focuses on possible complementary skills linked with the plurality of structures involved. The aim is to elaborate a competence’s list of reference dedicated to people piloting open innovation, and, to test this referential through new learning modules. The first step of the research consists in testing the hypothesis of the existence of specific open innovation management abilities. Based on a literature review and considering the work of the standard organization) in the field of innovation management (ISO/TC279), the research focuses on sensing practices that are typical of open innovation dynamics. These practices are then linked with a set of competences (knowledge and know how) thanks experts and company members interviews and according to a bibliographic analysis. Hence a competence referential is proposed for open innovation managers. In a second step, this referential has been valorized to design a new pedagogical module added to the syllabus of the Ecole Nationale Supérieure en Génie des Systèmes et de l’Innovation (ENSGSI) a French engineering school dedicated to innovation and management of technology. The paper gives the results of a two years’ experience about open innovation learning with students at final engineering level (master degree). The module uses the pedagogical concept of formative assessment: five evaluation sequences are integrated to the module. Each associating the students themselves, professors and employees of companies applying open innovation strategies. This transverse assessment is discussed all along the module by these three groups of people involved in order to get a continuous feedback. The outcomes of this evaluation process are detailed and analysed in constructivist terms: do the module gives students new abilities and are the competencies adapted to the launching phase of an open innovation process? In conclusion, the hypothesis of specific abilities relating to open innovation is validated. But the generic status of each of the competencies seems questionable. The wide range of openness situations suggests a necessary contextualization when identifying the pertinent targeted competencies of open innovation managers.', authkeywords='Competencies | Learning | Open Innovation | Partnership', citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85081104415', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Designing business models for augmented reality', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Röltgen D.', afid='123254954', affilname='Fraunhofer Institute for Mechatronic Systems Design', affiliation_city=None, affiliation_country='Germany', author_count='4', author_names='Röltgen, Daniel;Wortmann, Fabio;Grote, Eva Maria;Dumitrescu, Roman', author_ids='57203316838;57207540154;57215537710;35101763000', author_afids='123254954;123254954;123254954;123254954', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2019', publicationName='Managing Technology for Inclusive and Sustainable Growth - 28th International Conference for the International Association of Management of Technology, IAMOT 2019', issn=None, source_id='21100987455', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='630-646', description='Almost all sectors of the manufacturing industry are affected by a shift in which the traditional product portfolio is being replaced by highly integrated product service systems. This shift–also referred to as “servitization in manufacturing”–is accelerated by innovation potentials that arise from the progress of digitally enabled technologies. A technology with a considerable potential for the digital refinement of the product service business is Augmented Reality (AR). It enables real-world environments to be enriched with additional virtual content. For example, repair instructions can be visualized as a 3D animation superimposed on a physical machine, enabling service technicians to carry out complex tasks more time and cost efficiently. However, the integration of AR into the product service portfolio requires adjustments to the business model: (1) Companies have to identify promising use cases for AR that create value for the customer, thereby defining the value proposition of the business model. (2) The identified use cases need to be translated into products and services, integrated into the existing product service portfolio. (3) Promising business models have to be designed, taking into account the technology-specific challenges posed by AR (e.g. ensuring user acceptance, finding revenue models to cover the investment costs for AR devices). Despite the large variety of potential AR applications, business models successfully exploiting AR are still the exception, indicating that the development of sustainable business models is a significant challenge. With this in mind, in this paper, we present an approach for designing business models for AR. The approach consists of a procedure model providing step-by-step instructions on how to develop business models for AR and additional tools (e.g. catalogue with AR use cases, business model cards), that help to tackle the technology-specific challenges caused by AR. It combines a methodical procedure with technology-specific solution knowledge, allowing companies to utilize the benefits of AR for their product service business.

However, the mission is compounding the vexing problems such as ‘less sustainable trade deficits’ and ‘slow break-out for competitiveness’. At this juncture, the external competition and slow break-out in internal capabilities (including MoT capabilities) across its solar value chain have added to the burgeoning trade deficit of India. The Economic Survey 2018 identified the renewable energy sector as Champion Sector in Make in India 2.0 which has brought a renewed focus on the manufacturing capabilities of firms of Indian origin (FIOs) in the renewable sector. In this light, this paper explores the twin impact of the policy and technology management to improve the competitiveness of solar FIOs. The study begins with identification of drivers of competitive advantage in the Solar Photovoltaic (SPV) industry and an assessment of the gaps in the government policies. In the next stage, the study focuses on identification of constraints across the solar value chain, especially gaps in Management of Technology (MoT), which have led to decrease in competitiveness of FIOs. Based on the findings, a MoT strategy is devised with an objective to build capabilities and scale-up domestic SPV manufacturers. For this we adopted a mixed-method approach as a research methodology, focusing both on quantitative and qualitative analysis. This is followed by a systematic ‘problem structuring’ method to identify the root cause of low industrial competitiveness among Solar FIOs. The study also explores, which FIOs have resources to sustain competitiveness in solar, as China has done with firms such as Yingli, Jinko Solar, Trina Solar through benchmarking analysis. Our study is verified and supported by experiential insights derived through primary research and personal interviews of private and public policy experts in the solar domain. The paper contributes towards building practical knowledge about gaps in ‘strategy of firms’ and ‘policies of governments’ that hinder the ‘rapid turnaround’ of capable solar FIOs to start competing internationally on relevant parts of ‘solar industry value system’. This is also an exercise of learning lessons from the leaders, to propel India into envisioned leadership position in solar manufacturing.', authkeywords='MoT Strategy | Policies for Renewables | Solar FIOs | Solar Value Chain | Technology Innovation | Trade Competitiveness | Venture Competitiveness', citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='IRCC', fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='Industrial Research and Consultancy Centre'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85081096396', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Risk management of emerging biotechnologies', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Han S.G.', afid='60003880', affilname='Korea Institute of S&T Evaluation and Planning', affiliation_city='Eumseong-gun', affiliation_country='South Korea', author_count='1', author_names='Han, Sung Goo', author_ids='57143038100', author_afids='60003880', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2019', publicationName='Managing Technology for Inclusive and Sustainable Growth - 28th International Conference for the International Association of Management of Technology, IAMOT 2019', issn=None, source_id='21100987455', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='433-442', description='The World Economic Forum (WEF) has pointed the dual use dilemma of biotechnology innovations through a Global Risks Report and discussed the risk reduction and opportunity capture of biotechnology in relation to the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). Recent emerging biotechnologies, such as synthetic biology, gene editing and nano-biotechnology, as well as open source software and hardware, are concerned about the ease and sophistication of life manipulation and generation at low cost. These explosive synthetic biology and gene editing developments are also concerned with the possibility of dual use with biological weapons, which may be intentional or unintentional. The technological innovation of gene synthesis is rapidly advancing the synthetic biology that can dramatically reduce the costs and increase the accuracy and enable genome synthesis. Synthetic biology can revolutionize the function of living organisms by engineering and synthesizing genes as parts with one unit. The entire genome of the microbial organism was synthesized from small pieces, reaching the level at which other microorganisms were transferred and operated. Synthetic biology can be used to produce microorganisms that produce biofuels, medicines, or organic substances. On the other hand, the possibility of creating new pathogens with various risk characteristics as well as gain of function is increased for dual use. The research objective is to suggest the policy directions for risk management of emerging biotechnologies, including synthetic biology and gene editing and so on. The approach taken in this paper combined with qualitative and quantitative analysis methods, such as bibliographic analysis, peer reviews and in-depth interviews. We analyzed the policy formation, policy implementation and policy coordination for risk management on emerging biotechnologies and suggested science and technology-based policy directions to increase resilience to risk management in these areas.

It is argued that engineering design has a central role in how to realise the novelty aspect of innovation and often plays a critical role in maturing these into the valuable products, and there is a need to articulate the role of engineering design in innovation to better resonate with the business and management research.', authkeywords='Design engineering | Design management | Design process | Innovation', citedby_count=6, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherhybridgold', freetoreadLabel='Hybrid Gold', fund_acr='MEP', fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='Ministry of Environmental Protection'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85079772376', doi='10.1017/dsi.2019.312', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Effective innovation implementation of mechatronic product-service systems considering socio-technical aspects', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Koltun G.D.', afid='60026134;60019722', affilname='Universidade de Vigo;Technische Universität München', affiliation_city='Vigo;Munich', affiliation_country='Spain;Germany', author_count='7', author_names='Koltun, Gennadiy Dmitrovic;Romero Viturro, Carlos Alberto;Buchholz, Johan;Wissel, Juliane;Zaggl, Michael;Ocker, Felix;Vogel-Heuser, Birgit', author_ids='57194281880;57215039176;58336295100;57211287010;36609717700;57196097942;6603480302', author_afids='60019722;60026134;60019722;60019722;60019722;60019722;60019722', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2019', publicationName='Proceedings of the Design Society: International Conference on Engineering Design', issn='22204334', source_id='21100291832', eIssn='22204342', aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume='2019-August', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='3051-3060', description='It is estimated that about half of all innovations, such as innovations in mechatronic product-service systems (PSS), fail to deliver the expected benefits to the adopting organization.

In order to remedy this weakness, this paper builds on the work of interdisciplinary research collaboration. Experts from technical, socio-technical, and management fields integrate their work within a conceptual innovation implementation management system (IIMS). This IIMS is capable of capturing various methods and models that foster the socio-technical integration in mechatronic PSS.

Building on C-K theory, we show that such creative heritage needs multiple and independent layers of knowledge that \"speak\" of basic fixed objects. These properties correspond to general mathematical structures that we find in Topos theory. Thus, C-K/Topos predicts creative design strategies that can respect tradition in different ways. It also proves a form of \"innovation within tradition\" - \"sheafification\" in Topos words- that is not a compromise and builds on tradition itself. These findings fit with the lessons of great books of gastronomy.

This is followed by a demonstration of a design solution for a new cycle with two enhanced energy-converting devices, namely a wet combustion chamber and a spray-ejector condenser. The proposed gas and steam cycle unit is contained within a single turbine, whose benefits combine those offered by gas turbines (high inlet temperatures) and steam turbines (full expansion into a vacuum). The efficiency of the oxy-fuel combustion system with carbon dioxide capture was determined based on thermodynamic analyses carried out using in-house codes (COM-GAS). The motivation behind this research paper was provided by calls for diversification in the power generation industry in Poland as well as the need for new solutions in power plants, including compact ones. Compactness can be achieved when the plant is rid of its largest components such as the heat recovery steam generator and the conventional steam condenser. For this, it would be necessary to design non-standard cutting-edge devices, but the counterbalancing pay-off would be in their size, reduced to the point where power plants, in which they are installed, will be able to adequately address the needs of urban users and cater for heat production demand. The concept under consideration is based on the use of shale gas deposits in the place of extraction in a compact, zero-emission gas-steam turbine power system. In our case power plant compactness is achieved by using two new devices, namely: 1) a wet combustion chamber (with oxy-combustion and combustion chamber walls cooling by thermal transpiration); 2) a condenser spray-ejector (using a bulk condensation of vapor-gas). The main aim of the spray-ejector condenser is simultaneously condensing steam and compressing CO2 from the condensation pressure to about 1 bar. Hence, the most important innovation of this steam-gas cycle emerges as the enhanced condensation, which is based on the nano-injection of cold water and a jet-powered compression of CO2 performed in the spray-ejector condenser.', authkeywords='Carbon capture | Clean gas technology | Enhanced energy conversion | Gas-steam turbine | Wet combustion chamber', citedby_count=4, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85079548411', doi='10.1016/B978-0-12-409548-9.11140-6', pii='B9780124095489111406', pubmed_id=None, title='Natural disaster-Environmental health preparedness', subtype='ch', subtypeDescription='Book Chapter', creator='Lauriola P.', afid='60111558;60111140;60104028;60103683;60021199;60012318;60004591', affilname='Public Health Wales;Public Health England;University of Nicosia;Cardiff University School of Medicine;Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche;National Center for Environmental Health;Università degli Studi di Modena e Reggio Emilia', affiliation_city='Cardiff;London;Nicosia;Cardiff;Rome;Atlanta;Modena', affiliation_country='United Kingdom;United Kingdom;Cyprus;United Kingdom;Italy;United States;Italy', author_count='8', author_names='Lauriola, Paolo;Leonardi, Giovanni;Righi, Elena;Bayleyegn, Tesfaye M.;Schnall, Amy Helene;Malilay, Josephine;Louca, Soulla;Behbod, Behrooz', author_ids='7004129174;58311755800;7005982242;12769877800;54380876800;6701360657;6506053502;55753422100', author_afids='60021199;60111140;60004591;60012318;60012318;60012318;60104028;60103683-60111558', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='1 January 2019', publicationName='Encyclopedia of Environmental Health', issn=None, source_id='21100945258', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Book', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='563-573', description='This article will summarize a short, simple and comprehensive description of natural disaster preparedness and response, focusing on: • What they are in terms of qualitative and quantitative perspectives; • How they can be addressed in terms of prevention and management; • Innovations that may be piloted, evaluated, adopted, and diffused if appropriate.

The Beresheet spacecraft hard landing on the Moon, April 2019, has inspired the Israeli public, children and adults alike, and the Desert Mars Analog Ramon Station (D-MARS) non profit organization was established during Beresheet developmental stages. It is dedicated for establishing an international planetary analog research center in the Negev desert, Israel. D-MARS aims to promote space-related education, science and technological innovation via space simulation or analog mission infrastructure. The Ramon Crater in the Negev desert was chosen for its Mars-like geomorphology and geology, isolation and hyper arid climate conditions allowing for a Mars simulated environment. The D-MARS habitat is a scalable deployed portable structure. It can support six analog astronauts (“Ramonauts”) living in isolation during few weeks of an analog mission. The habitat has a science lab that includes a biological safety cabinet and additional equipment to perform geo-biological experiments internally, a single hydroponic tray, a common room, six wood encased sleeping pods, kitchenette, a small restroom. D-MARS members have performed Mars analog missions during 2018-2019. During the 2019 field campaign (February - March 2019), several analog Mars missions were performed: An 11-day main analog mission; a three-day”Landing on Mars” simulation mission to prepare and put into operation the infrastructure and technological equipment, simulating a crew in a landing phase on Mars; a two-day medical analog mission that included several medical emergency simulated events; a dedicated high school student group performed a three-day analog missions as part of the Young Astronaut Academy (YAA). The YAA program promotes STEM and the love of space and science. During all missions, all simulated extravehicular activities (EVAs) were done in a dedicated sim spacesuit, when operating outside of the habitat. The Ramonauts were in fairly complete isolation and communicated only with Mission Support Center (MSC), via text/image, in a dedicated webserver, with a 10-minute delay, each way. During the main 11-day mission various scientific experiments included soil analysis, environmental microorganisms metagenomics, isolation and characterization, rover utilization for external mapping and situational exploration, various psychological analyses of crew's wellness and more.

This payload aims to meet Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations (UN) in the field of Quality Education, Industry, Innovation and Partnerships by fostering international education and collaboration. This is realized by conducting research in remote sensing, in-situ measurement investigations and technology demonstration. The scientific objectives are diverse and include experiments i) to determine and to record sprite-type lightning phenomena from space, ii) to verify the functional efficiency of a sub-scaled intake demonstrator for Atmosphere Breathing Electric Propulsion, iii) to establish a sensor system for measuring the total particle flux density in the Thermosphere and iv) to perform and to evaluate cosmic dust measurements of an impact ionization dust detector in low Earth orbit. Within this framework, the avionics core based on the Flexible LEO Platform 2 on-board computer architecture developed by Airbus DS Germany is to be verified for hosted payload systems. Special demands on space systems engineering is required due to specific requirements of the multiple subsystems in order to guarantee the functionality of the system itself and to enable promising research conditions. A detailed preliminary engineering design solution of the payload is derived from an initial mission analysis and mission definition by applying the methods of a space systems engineering approach. This comprises the elaboration of mission objectives; the identification, compilation and assessment of requirements and constraints; a feasibility study; and a first design iteration of all scientific experiments. In addition, an overall payload consideration regarding electrical interfaces, software sequences, power consumption, data rates and potentially occurring risks has been performed.

Creative solutions are required to ensure the ADF is at the forefront of technology to ensure the safety and security of Australia and its national interests. In Space research, as in many other S&T fields, the need for individuals and teams to tap into creative processes to produce innovative solutions and long-term visions is essential. However, there are many barriers that hinder the creative process, particularly when in a team environment or in larger organisations with entrenched culture and business practices. Consequently, a qualitative preliminary investigation was performed at DST, to better understand how creativity is perceived to apply to its science and engineering teams and the key factors and activities at team and organisational levels that could be addressed to foster creativity. These key factors and activities are determined from the views of a limited selection of middle-senior level employees, team-leaders and management, and are intended to inform further studies and efforts at DST and other research organisations. The preliminary study utilised: review of literature, interviews with staff, and creativity audit questionnaires. The responses showed that participants see creativity as an intrinsic part of their work in a research organisation; however, highly creative ideas are not always proposed due to local and organisational barriers. According to the limited number of participants, and consistent with literature, creativity is hindered when where there is pressure to meet the expectations of stakeholders within a tight timeframe, and when there are high levels of administration and risk avoidance. Additionally, cultural and personal factors can hinder creativity such as the fear of being judged or ridiculed for proposing ideas and the fear of failure. The participants identified that the primary requirements for creativity in teams was found to be 'having the personal freedom to be creative (this includes time and supervisory support)', and 'ensuring the correct, safe and healthy group dynamics'. This paper discusses the findings of the preliminary study including the key focus areas for increasing creativity in teams as viewed by a limited selection of mid-senior level staff and management at DST.

The leading countries in this global value chain (GVC) present a holistic perception of this indissoluble binomial. However, there are learner countries which have been integrated in an unprecedented way into Aeronautics. Therefore, this paradigm break is the reason why this investigation was conducted. The “technological capability” concept builds an architecture that fully supports the relation between technological and governance development in Politics, Commerce and Society. Therefore, on this research, a theoretical approach of Science and Technology in the field of Social Sciences and International Relations was developed with the purpose of generating an adequate analysis framework based on the Governance Theory, Open Innovation and Technological Capabilities literature. This framework served to analyze three case studies, such as Brazil, Canada and China. As intermediate industrial leaders in the manufacture of regional aircraft, despite having a different technological trajectory, their technical capabilities impacted on the GVC, thus generating a new governance in local institutions and international organizations. In these three cases, not only favorable conditions have emerged, but also, they faced a poor management regarding public policies. As a result, it was found that this atmosphere is called as a National Innovation System (NIS) and it is a methodological turning point to analyze the technological transfer, adoption and assimilation in developing countries, which could lead to finished products for the space sector. In the three case studies, the main interest was a military, political and industrial integration. However, considering the Industry 4.0 and a global technological convergence, it is concluded that the aerospace industry has become a multicausal and multisectoral phenomenon when integrating new advanced functionalities such as Blockchain, Big Data, Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Analytics.

These systems shall actively assist the crew in decision making and in the management of their health and safety. Intelligent inflight medical systems are thought to be the most appropriate solution for integrating multidomain data. However, the use of AI in aerospace medicine may be questionable as AI builds on large data about known medical conditions, while there is little data about long-term missions in space and only a reference population, the astronaut population. Commercial crewed and space tourists might have inferior physical and mental performance than current formal astronauts. Therefore, astronaut-based AI might not be directly applicable to commercial astronauts, as this is population is exposed to a higher risk undergoing medical conditions in space. There is a need for addressing the use of AI from the phase-design to guarantee integration of AI-types when space flights will be opened to commercial astronauts.

A long duration mission (LDM) project based learning 'design for space' studio focusing on astronaut health and wellbeing has been developed for students who have completed 1.5 years of university study in any disciplinary area. This envisioned practice environment seeks to expand diffusion of space studies and importantly stimulate motivational strategies that are inclusive across discipline boundaries toward the merits of multi-modal ways of seeing, developing and collaborating through an iterative design process from concept to prototype embracing design thinking in diverse projects. The interdisciplinary space studio's framework acknowledges discipline-based specialisations and the intersection potential of synergistic team approaches through heightened understanding of cross-disciplinary vocabularies. The action-learning lab captures positive general public sentiment toward space discoveries and educative insights of past space exploration and space education with the view that experiencing novel and impactful nature of a wider variety of disciplinary skills and in complementing one's own field can stimulate a continued interest in the promise of the future.

The flagship program is designed around a corporate-university collaboration facilitated by a non-profit entity. First, the students are given a practical, commercially applicable goal of launching a student-made rocket above the Karman line (100km). Working on this project, whether successful or not, provides real world experience of the technical problems and issues many space start-ups face in the design and development of new technology. Second, the initiate utilizes corporate resources from a private company to provide mentorship, expertise, facilities, and funding to provide the resources the students need to work on and complete the project. The project will span multiple years and involve students from many engineering disciplines. Students can engage in the project either as a class or as a club.

Also the technologies of the Space systems and products are deeply changing through new paradigms based on innovation and sustainability and a New Space Economy era is now in front of us. This both in traditional markets e.g. low cost satellites constellation for TLC applications and in new emerging sectors e.g. Space Exploration Tourism. The space sector SME's, in order to face new opportunities emerging from this evolving situation, have to invest in innovation and internationalization. To support the local SME's in the Internationalization growth, the Piemonte Region is acting through its Agency called Piemonte Agency for Investments and Export (Centro Estero per l'Internazionalizzazione - CEIPIEMONTE) that is involved in these activities since more than 40 years by means of dedicated Integrated Project teams using specifically allocated budgets and methodologies oriented to promote among other objectives the aggregation of the companies. The Aerospace sector in Piemonte is in fact a strategic axis of the regional policy, it accounts about 15000 employees and 4 BEuro of turnover. The presence of 6 big players, more than 300 SME's, 3 Universities and several Research centers confirms the Piemonte as one of the most important Aerospace districts in Europe. Recent Piemonte Agency Space initiatives have been preliminary presented at IAC 2018 in Bremen in their methodology and first steps (see IAC-18.E6.2.12) including in particular dedicated Space Workshops and Working Groups on innovative products. In the first Space Workshop 4 regional space key players were able to propose 8 innovative product ideas having possible application in market commercial projects by next 3 or 4 years. Following a well consolidated CEIPIEMONTE approach 8 Working Groups have been originated including the companies proposing the idea and those partners which were interested in the development of the new product on the basis of relevant competencies. The product technical and programmatic feasibility has been investigated in order to issue a proposal to some supporting Organizations (e.g. Piemonte Regional Government, ESA, ASI, EC, private entities) willing to co-finance the Product development non-recurring activities. In line with CEIPIEMONTE well consolidated practice, some SME's teams investigated the possibility to originate a cluster that is essential to improve their critical mass in front of the global competition. Such clusters are conceived with proper governance scheme that ensures win-win approach for the partners and flexible low cost organization. Other two Space Workshops have been organized in 2018 focusing respectively on the evaluation of the first 8 initiatives results and on the spatialization of 28 Environmental and Thermal Control equipment's coming from other sectors. Today some of these initiatives have reached significant achievements in terms of results for the involved SME's and other are in progress targeting interesting results in the next coming years. The paper after an introduction on the Space market and regional background, will detail above results and will describe possible perspectives.\", authkeywords=\"Innovation and Internationalization | New Space Market | Piedmont Region Aerospace District | Piemonte Agency | SME's | Space Clusters\", citedby_count=1, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='FEDER', fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='European Regional Development Fund'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85079088218', doi='10.35199/epde2019.24', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Creative connectivity project – A network based approach to understand correlations between interdisciplinary group dynamics and creative performance', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Torrisi V.S.', afid='60111768;60104069;60022109;60017293;60010146', affilname='The Alan Turing Institute;Royal College of Art;Queen Mary University of London;Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II;Università degli Studi di Catania', affiliation_city='London;London;London;Naples;Catania', affiliation_country='United Kingdom;United Kingdom;United Kingdom;Italy;Italy', author_count='4', author_names='Torrisi, Vanna Savina;Manfredi, Sabato;Iacopini, Iacopo;Latora, Vito', author_ids='56789892300;7004764756;24474549700;7003540219', author_afids='60104069;60017293;60022109-60111768;60022109-60111768-60010146', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2019', publicationName='Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Towards a New Innovation Landscape, E and PDE 2019', issn=None, source_id='21100932445', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description='Creativity, technology and innovation are fundamental driving forces that often trigger behavioural and cultural changes in our societies.

Taking the Innovation Design Engineering (IDE) programme at the Royal College of Art as a case study, the research addresses the need to develop a more rigorous understanding of the creation of innovation fostered by diversity, a risk-taking culture and acceptance of failure. A novel approach combining data science and network theory has been developed to monitor, quantify and analyse specific dynamics of interdisciplinary groups of students at the IDE programme. The focus was to investigate the network contribution to the performance of a team in an environment that is naturally interdisciplinary by using data respectively from a bespoke developed web application and a conversation activity monitoring system.

Screencasts are screen captures of learning materials, broken into detailed steps with narration and synchronized captions provided by an instructor. With screencasts, students are able to follow the instructor's elaboration of the problem step-by-step to understand the underlying principles. Our screencasts approach is targeted at upper level technical courses in Civil Engineering and focuses on inclusive Civil Engineering classroom with deaf students. A bank of thirty eight screencasts was developed in 2012 and has been applied to supplement a Civil Engineering undergraduate core course: Structural Analysis. The screencasts are posted on the instructor's teaching website, and are open to all students and interpreters participating in this course. The final calculated grades of the hearing students and the deaf students were collected for five consecutive academic years from 2011 to 2015. The grades of the hearing students and the deaf students were analyzed and compared before and after the screencasts were introduced. Another comparable Civil Engineering course without screencasts, Elementary Structures, was selected as a benchmark to evaluate the effects of screencasts on students' learning. Surveys were performed to gather students' feedback about their experience in using screencasts. The research results show that implementing screencasts to supplement traditional Civil Engineering lectures may enhance both deaf and hearing students' learning effectiveness.\", authkeywords='Civil engineering | Performance | Streaming video', citedby_count=5, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85079031049', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Exploring liberatory makerspaces: Preliminary results and future directions', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Masters A.S.', afid='60027090;60009254', affilname='Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University;Purdue University', affiliation_city='Blacksburg;West Lafayette', affiliation_country='United States;United States', author_count='5', author_names='Masters, Adam S.;Foster, Ellen K.;Groen-Mccall, Cassandra;Mcnair, Lisa D.;Riley, Donna M.', author_ids='57195964629;57212505734;57210789973;23094964200;56256850100', author_afids='60027090;60009254;60009254;60027090;60009254', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2019', publicationName='Advances in Engineering Education', issn=None, source_id='17600154907', eIssn='19411766', aggregationType='Journal', volume='7', issueIdentifier='3', article_number=None, pageRange=None, description=\"Since the mid-2000s, the U.S. maker movement has heralded the 'democratization' of tools and skills needed for innovation (Autodesk 2012; Cavalcanti 2013; Deloitte 2015; Dubrow 2015b; Kalil, Patel, and Miller 2014; SBS Viceland 2017; Obama White House 2014, 2016). Considering its involvement of old and new technologies (e.g., blacksmithing, 3D printing), various settings (e.g., urban, rural, educational, community), and identity groups (e.g., class, race), the maker movement is well poised to engage historically and systematically minoritized groups in engineering. However, maker communities perpetuate exclusionary practices, replicating power dynamics often seen in engineering and catering more to white, male, cisgender, heterosexual, middle-class, abled hobbyists (Chachra 2015; Foster 2017; Masters 2018; Vossoughi, Hooper, and Escude 2016).

The present study was framed as a theoretical review to address the topic under consideration, relying on evidence from relevant literature. A total of 63 articles were reviewed and they include government reports, news publications, primary research studies, and theoretical analysis. These materials were utilized to comprehensively synthesize research on the current stance of STEM education in the UAE, as well as the challenges faced, and projected possibilities. Findings revealed that the UAE has made better progress but is limited by challenges such as lack of interest in STEM fields by UAE nationals and, the inaccessibility of STEM education across all age groups and income earners. In the face of opportunities such as the development of collaborative learning, a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) boost of at least 12% and, the preparation of Emiratis for the future workplace, recommendations were made.

The initiative began with the development of the Coe Library Student Innovation Center (CSIC) makerspace, in order to spark student innovation, creativity, and design skills. This was a cooperative effort of the College of Engineering and Applied Science together with the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Education, and the University of Wyoming Libraries. The initiative also included development of another active learning “makerspace” in the new Engineering Education and Research Building (EERBSIC). Makerspaces employ technology along with hands-on education to spark student innovation, creativity, design, and entrepreneurship. This paper describes the importance of makerspaces to education, the step-by-step approach used to develop and launch a makerspace, lessons learned and used in the development of the EERBSIC, and a sample of programs conducted within the makerspace.

PBSL provides students with opportunities to design and develop innovative solutions for real clients with real needs. The study focuses on the perceptions of 13 mechanical engineering graduates who participated in a one-semester Rehabilitation Biomechanics course that includes development of tailor-made and low-cost assistive devices for people with special needs. The study aims to evaluate the long-term impact of PBSL on graduates, after several years of employment in industry. The course is a part of an ORT Braude College of Engineering flagship project: ‘‘Engineers on Behalf of People with Disabilities’’. The study uses the Grounded Theory qualitative research methodology that allows revealing ideas that could not be foreseen. Interviews with the graduates exposed the challenges they experienced during the course as well as the gains. They have developed an awareness of the roles of engineering solutions in assisting people with special needs. The direct and challenging interaction with disabled customers changed their attitudes towards people with special needs, and developed in them an empathetic Client-Centered Design approach. The PBSL experience influenced graduates’ interests, careers, and personal development, and the skills they brought to their workplaces. Research shows how PBSL may bridge the gap between theory and practice, looking at the community as a legitimate partner in the development of innovations.

At the 2018 Capstone Design Conference, a panel discussion specifically addressed the impact of roles and responsibilities on teams in capstone design. This paper summarizes the main discussion points of that panel session and relates these topics to a model of shared leadership and distributed influence in the innovation process. The shared leadership model addressed in this study combines an Input-Process-Output (IPO) model from research on teams with existing leadership behavior literature to link team characteristics and leadership practices to team responses and team effectiveness. The students and faculty that comprised the panel represented diverse areas: engineering practice, military teams, academia, and undergraduate design. Detailed notes from the panel session were analyzed by panel members to identify themes and current practices that emerged from the discussion. These themes and practices were mapped to the existing shared leadership model to situate the phenomena in the larger IPO model and positions the phenomena in current organizational leadership literature. The result of this study is a capstone design-specific adaptation of the existing shared leadership model. This model provides capstone faculty and students a more comprehensive framework in which to consider how team roles and responsibilities may affect team response and effectiveness. Conclusions from this study stress the criticality of capstone design faculty in team formation to foster shared leadership. The framework suggests that shared leadership within the team may elicit positive team response through accountability and responsibility and will lead to greater team effectiveness.

For that reason, this study aims at the synergy between low-pressure cold spray (LPCS) as a tool for coating deposition and sol-gel technique for fabrication of the feedstock powder. The complementarity of both methods is important for the examined topic. On one side, the LPCS being automized and quick mean provides the solid-state of feedstock material in nondestructive conditions and hence the hydrophobicity imparted on the sol-gel route is preserved. On the other side, the sol-gel synthesis enables the production of oxide materials with enhanced deformability due to amorphous form which supports the anchoring while LPCS spraying. In the paper, several aspects including optimal fluoroalkylsilane (FOTS) concentration or substrate roughness are examined initially for altering the superhydrophobicity of produced coatings. Further, it is shown that the appropriate optimization of feedstock powder, being submicron silica matrices covered with two-layer FOTS sheath, may facilitate the anchoring process, support roughening the substrate or cause enhancement the coating hydrophobicity. All the discussion is supported by the characteristics including surface morphology, wettability and thermal behaviour examined by electron microscopy, water contact angle measurements and thermal analysis (TGA/DSC), respectively. The coatings presented in the paper are characterized by an uneven thickness of up to a few silica particles, but final hydrophobicity is provided uniformly on the surface by the formation of multi-level roughness by a detachment of outer layer from the SiO2 particles.

In the present study, integration of UAVs and mobile technology has been adopted for re-engineering of the UAV based delivery process. The fundamental approach of the present study is to involve the customer in the entire process of payload delivery under effective coordination to provide customer-oriented functionality which will improve the customer encounter in logistics operations. People don't get to visit his/her loved one's grave due to lack of time, busy schedule or traffic congestion. Visiting of graveyard is unfriendly for elderly too because of their health issues. Today, by the coordination of developed sensor and IT innovation, visiting of graveyard has become simple. To be perfect and reasonable, artifacts of the proposed model can easily be implemented for the virtual visiting of graveyard. By utilization of the proposed model, individuals and particularly elderly or women can easily visit the loved one's grave from the comfort of their home by watching ongoing recordings of the blooming activity on grave or tomb. Furthermore people can send recorded audio, voice message or Quran recitation from his/her registered mobile app at the graveyard. The proposed model is evaluated by conducting survey-based quantitative research approach based on the Delphi method. The performance of the model is analyzed by the goodness-of-fit (Chi-square) test. The inspection of the overall outcome against the re-engineering model and its provided service efficiency has a greater impact of acceptance.\", authkeywords='partial controlling | payload delivery | Real-time monitoring | recorded audio delivery | UAV', citedby_count=5, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85077732921', doi='10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2936860', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Research on Financial Technology Innovation and Application Based on 5G Network', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Tian M.W.', afid='60027064;60017375;60001429;115563343', affilname='Universidade Federal do Piauí;Instituto de Telecomunicações;Shandong University of Science and Technology;Yango University', affiliation_city='Teresina;Aveiro;Qingdao;Fuzhou', affiliation_country='Brazil;Portugal;China;China', author_count='6', author_names='Tian, Man Wen;Wang, Lukun;Yan, Shu Rong;Tian, Xiao Xiao;Liu, Zheng Qiao;Rodrigues, Joel Jose P.C.', author_ids='55858113300;57102845700;55858499000;57213267257;57213268803;25930566300', author_afids='115563343;60001429;60001429;60001429;60001429;60027064-60017375', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2019', publicationName='IEEE Access', issn=None, source_id='21100374601', eIssn='21693536', aggregationType='Journal', volume='7', issueIdentifier=None, article_number='8809710', pageRange='138614-138623', description='In the mobile era, more and more financial institutions are beginning to cooperate with financial technology companies to enhance services and attract customers.

Through international imitation, emerging countries have the opportunity to adopt clean techniques of developed countries. Because of different industrial structures, it is unachievable to learn the green technology across all fields. Previous studies consider that innovations could create green production models to improve the production capacity that reduces energy input and waste discharge. However, while evaluating emerging countries' economic growth, the environment indicators were often neglected. Empirical investigation of the role of innovation in green economy's growth is still rare. The first objective of this study is to adopt an integrated framework to investigate emerging countries' green economy by considering environmental factors. Secondly, environmentally sensitive productivity growth index was employed to decompose the productivity progress of green economy into catch-up effect, innovation effect, and technical leadership to examine the role of innovation. Thirdly, implications were provided for the policy makers in relation to green growth. Thirty-nine emerging countries were chosen as samples, which were divided into America, Asia, and Europe according to their locations. We found that America is still an imitator in developing green economy. In contrast, Asia starts to transition to innovation, which has become another critical promoter for green growth. Europe was found to lead on the technology frontier because of proper industrial planning and technology accumulation. The progress to innovation and technical leadership could ensure a stable green growth in the future.

FC entails assigning digitally mediated instructional content as preparation before class, and thus free up class time to cultivate higher-order thinking skills, problem solving, threshold concepts and engage in collaborative learning. Despite a predominantly large interest in this educational innovation, there are a number of pedagogical challenges that need to be highlighted. This paper examines the educational implications of using FC in a higher education context, which emerged from my own experiences with the systematic use of FC in teaching a course in Change Management (CM). Based on recent literature within the use of FC, I discuss both the pedagogical rationale and the critical points that I have become aware of in my teaching. I thus extend the argument to question the adherence to any particular model or delivery modes, as in the case of FC, which risks reinforcing various content transmission paradigms. Rather, the attention should at all times be on the underlying pedagogy, focused on developing, delivering, and evaluating learning experiences that promote effective and significant improvements in student achievement. Using technology to enhance learning requires a more radical redesign of the teaching and learning experience, which takes advantage of the technological affordances for creating hybrid, flexible learning and enabling new ways of knowing, working and becoming within and across various disciplinary and professional fields. Based on recent literature regarding FC, I identify the pedagogical challenges that exist, despite the popularity of FC as educational innovation. I compare some of the critical points with my own experience with adopting FC in a course in Change Management (CM). I discuss the pros and cons with FC in the light of a written student evaluation of experienced learning from the CM-course as FC.

Engineering energetic nanocomposites with tailored and tunable combustion characteristics is indispensable for their deployment in both civilian and defense applications. Specifically, a heterogeneous mixture of fuel [aluminum (Al), boron, magnesium, silicon, etc.] and oxidizer [cupric oxide, bismuth trioxide (Bi2O3), ferric oxide, etc.] with both the constituents having nanoscale dimensions constitutes a class of energetic material known as nanothermites. Among various fuels employed in nano-energetic formulations, the number of theoretical and experimental investigations on the utilization of Al outweighs that of any other metallic fuel. Knowledge on the physical and chemical characteristics of the constituents and their impact on combustion performance are fundamental to accelerate the pace of research and development in nano-energetic composites. Efforts to develop comprehensive understanding of the oxidation behavior are discussed in this article. Furthermore, the organization, intimacy, and dimensions of discrete fuels and oxidizers apart from their chemistry largely dictate the combustion kinetics exhibited by nanothermites. For a given nanocomposite, increasing the interfacial contact area between fuel and oxidizer improves its reaction rate by 3–5 orders of magnitude as a result of drastic reduction in mass and heat transport lengths. The bottom-up self-assembly process offers the most realistic solution to enhance the interfacial contacts between nanoscale constituents employing different approaches. This review summarizes the key findings in this area of research and lists the key challenges and opportunities for furthering the application aspects. Enhancement of combustion characteristics of energetic liquids through the utilization of Al and metal oxide nanoparticles as additives is another area of related research that continues to receive increasing attention (Sundaram et al. 2017). Energetic liquids possess unique characteristics such as lower activation temperature, higher pressure, and better volume expansion. Experimental research efforts have demonstrated ample promise for overcoming the inherent problems such as lower energy density and slow burn kinetics associated with energetic liquids.

Quality training is one that matches the social and labour needs of the moment. Transversal competences are part of the university curriculum and its relevance lies in its ability to be generalizable and transferable to the different contexts and activities in the current volatile and complex labour market. METHOD. The methodological design of this research is descriptive and transversal and aims to assess the training in transversal competences of undergraduate students. In order to do this, an analysis of the discrepancies between the development of competences, the student's domain and the importance granted to professional development is established. A multivariable procedure on professional development provides information on satisfaction, effectiveness, functionality and the adequacy of the training. The research involves 1.137 final year students of the five areas of knowledge of the University of Murcia, through an ad hoc designed questionnaire. RESULTS. The data show a degree of medium-low satisfaction with the training received especially in the Experimental Sciences; the effectiveness of the university is different in the areas of knowledge, in the same way as the perception of usefulness of training for professional development. Engineering students obtain the highest scores on both variables. In addition, there is an imbalance between development, domain and relevance that can be extended to all degrees. However, despite the discrepancies detected, it shows a positive trend towards the adaptation of university training to professional requirements. DISCUSSION.

The developments in the construction materials, mix proportions, dimensions, mixing, and conditions (temperature) used to enhance the concrete technology, have important impacts on characteristics of concrete strength and heat development manner.

Hence it is comprehensible that even for a product that initially appears revolutionary usually one or more references can be found. This enhances, for example, the comparability or the availability of a products subsystems so that they are more easily to deal with. Especially during the development of a new product, which means the start of a new product line, the use of reference system elements helps to reduce development efforts. Reference system elements are, for example, physical products whose functions or components are relevant for one’s own product. By scanning the system of objectives for smaller subsystems one may find those functions or components just mentioned. For this scientific work a development process of a technology rollout was examined. The objective pursued was to gain insights on possibilities and challenges of deriving knowledge from such reference system elements in this specific case. A suitable research environment was offered by a medium sized machine manufacturer. A new technology to process foam particles using radio frequency is being developed there. The established process using steam is already in the high-end range, which is why only a small development potential is left. From the findings in this case study in synthesis with the state of the art on innovation management and knowledge management a descriptive process model is derived. The focus of the process model is to support the search for relevant reference system elements. For the examined machine, for example, the common microwave was used as a reference element.

The primary focus of this investigation was on assessing the effect of two interventions, combining and classifying concepts, on the originality and quantity of the concepts produced. In this research, we used the Decision Tree for Originality Assessment in Design (DTOAD) as a measure of concept originality. Statistical analysis showed that both the combine and the classify interventions lead to concept generation with higher originality. We also found that students produced higher number of the radically different concept, i.e. concepts with originality score 7.5 and above, however this effect was observed in all the test groups. These interventions made improvements and thus can be encouraged as a part of an ideation or an engineering problem solving task in the undergraduate engineering education to help the students develop creative skills.', authkeywords='Creativity | DTOAD | Originality | Quantitative', citedby_count=3, openaccess=0, freetoread='repositoryam', freetoreadLabel='Green', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85076418609', doi='10.1115/DETC2019-97008', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Prototype design in agile product development processes for technical systems', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Riesener M.', afid='60016653', affilname='Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen', affiliation_city='Aachen', affiliation_country='Germany', author_count='4', author_names='Riesener, Michael;Doelle, Christian;Schloesser, Sebastian;Schuh, Guenther', author_ids='55662245000;57193738545;28167861400;7004013060', author_afids='60016653;60016653;60016653;60016653', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2019', publicationName='Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference', issn=None, source_id='21100938744', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume='7', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description='Agile development processes such as Scrum have been successfully applied in the software industry for many years. Based on experience, industrial practitioners indicate three predominant benefits of agile development processes compared to traditional software development processes. First of all, development results better fit customers’ and other stakeholders’ needs. That is because they are intensively involved in the development process by receiving, applying and assessing functional software increments in a defined cadence throughout the development process. Secondly, agile development processes better cope with unexpected changes in the development process due to the built-in process flexibility. Lastly, development speed has significantly increased in most of the agile software development projects, resulting in a shorter time-to-market. Especially in the context of radical innovations for technical systems, manufacturing companies are striving for approaches to optimize their development processes in a similar direction. Traditional plan-oriented development approaches such as VDI 2221 or Cooper’s Stage-Gate Process turn out to be insufficiently customer oriented, too inflexible and project duration is usually too long to reach an adequate time-to-market. For that reason, a large community in academia and industrial practice is developing and implementing approaches to adapt agile software development practices for the development of technical systems. However, a current study in industrial practice reveals that out of 23 objectives, that are expected when introducing agile development processes to technical systems, the three objectives mentioned above, show the largest negative deviations from expected benefit to realized benefit. Therefore, the overall goal of this research is to address these gaps by developing an explicit methodological approach for an agile development of technical systems. It turns out, that mainly the role of prototyping and the way product specifications are handled during the development process change significantly in the course of introducing agility to development of technical systems. Agile practitioners strive to not necessarily define product specifications comprehensively upfront, as it is postulated in plan-oriented development processes. In contrast, product specifications, which are of major importance to the overall development project, are specified and validated with customers and other stakeholders in early prototypes. Therefore, prototypes are realized in a defined cadence throughout the development process to gradually specify and validate the product. However, the way product specifications are prioritized and selected in the development of technical systems has to differ substantially from the general way Scrum or other existing agile development processes propose. That is because technical systems are characterized by multiple technical interrelations, resulting in informational dependencies for the development process. For that reason, a prioritization along criteria such as customer value, development effort and risk seems too narrow in the context of technical systems. In fact, the prioritization of product specifications has to consider both, the value being generated by their realization as well as the informational dependencies towards other specifications. Furthermore, when designing a prototype, time constraints need to be particularly considered due to lead times in parts delivery and prototype production. Therefore, this paper introduces a methodology to prioritize and select technical design parameters in agile development processes. The methodology can be applied in the cyclical sprint planning that aims at defining the scope of the next prototype to be developed. As outlined above, the major paradigms of value generation, informational dependencies as well as lead-time and effort are crucial when adapting agile for technical systems and are consequently implemented in the methodology. These paradigms are operationalized to explicitly address the mentioned major objectives of agile development processes, which are currently showing are large gap between expected benefit and realized benefit in industrial practice. The methodology is applied to the real development process of an RGB laser light source for digital cinema projectors, which is summarized as a case study in the paper. Insights from this application are equally discussed as the resulting next steps in further developing and aligning the methodology to the needs of industrial practice.', authkeywords=None, citedby_count=5, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='DFG', fund_no='390621612', fund_sponsor='Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85076402905', doi='10.1115/DETC2019-97801', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Investigating usability of an innovation management decision aid', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Gendreau E.', afid='60111570;60026610;60009236', affilname='International University of Rabat;Clemson University;INP Grenoble', affiliation_city='Sale;Clemson;Grenoble', affiliation_country='Morocco;United States;France', author_count='4', author_names='Gendreau, Elizabeth;Summers, Joshua D.;Benhayoun-Sadafiyine, Lamiae;Le Dain, Marie Anne', author_ids='57188286800;7202483244;57218097489;35790178000', author_afids='60026610;60026610;60111570;60009236', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2019', publicationName='Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference', issn=None, source_id='21100938738', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume='1', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description='Initial usability testing was used to identify and fix usability concerns within a recently developed absorptive capacity assessment tool.

Motivated by this shortcoming, this work leverages network theory to visualize and characterize features of a conceptual design space. To illustrate the utility of network theory for these purposes, a network composed of a corpus of solutions to a design problem and their semantic similarity is derived, and its design properties (e.g., uniqueness and innovation potential) are studied. This network-based approach not only characterizes features of individual designs themselves, but also uncovers more nuanced properties of the design space through studying emerging clusters of concepts.

Research data's obtained from 234 participants who work in technocities were tested with structural equation model. Resource dependency dimensions, which are independent variables, were evaluated in two sub-dimensions; the importance of the resource (RIMP) and the availability of alternatives (AA). Uncertainty scale was evaluated in three sub-dimensions; ability to be a resource (AbiR), resource scarcity (RS) and resource interconnectedness (RINT). Mediating variables were planned as solidarity (SOL) and intellectual capital-human capital (H-C), social capital (S-C) and organizational capital (O-C)-The results of the analysis emphasized the importance of solidarity and intellectual capital in terms of dependency and uncertainty. In analyzing the mediation effects, three different models were tested and were determined to be parallel. The SOL and O-C dependents found to have a direct effect on the innovation performance (INP).

In this frame, a study was carried to reveal the dynamics of innovations from idea to product in three steps. In the first step, semantic network analysis was used in 400 papers with the highest citations published in 20 journals with the highest h5-index in the health field from 2013 to 2015. Web scraping and text mining tools based on R language were used to create semantic network structures. Semantic network analysis revealed that the focus of the articles was on cancer. The analysis carried out using the Sankey diagram revealed that scientists who work in cancer are most frequently involved in the lung, however, the scientists who related with the lung are not focused on treatment, and heart. The experts' comments are due to challenges in the treatment of the lung cancer scientist may be focused on areas like diagnosis and phases of cancer. In the second step, 260,000 rows of Clinical Trials cases were analyzed. In the third step, an analysis was made on a total of 1000 patent documents selected from the lens.org site, which contains the databases in global patent offices. Methods used in the analysis of the articles in the first step were carried out in these documents. According to this, diagnosis, treatment and therapy words the most common pass with lung cancer through the documents. In addition, the most cited authors in the field of lung cancer were searched in patent documents. These authors are considered as academic backgrounds that feed new technologies. According to this, it has been found that there are no major matches among the most cited authors of 400 papers and most cited authors in the patent documents in the field of lung cancer. It has been found that patents feed on more specific journals rather than major medical journals. In addition, it was also found that the most cited authors of 400 papers were different from the patent owners.\", authkeywords='Artificial intelligence | Socio-technological systems | Strategic technology forecasting | Text mining', citedby_count=5, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85076260441', doi='10.1016/j.procs.2019.09.126', pii='S1877050919312967', pubmed_id=None, title='What ecosystem model to support the creation of social innovation technopoles?', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Znagui Z.', afid='60026692;120021471', affilname='Université Hassan 1er;Faculty of Juridical', affiliation_city='Settat;Settat', affiliation_country='Morocco;Morocco', author_count='2', author_names='Znagui, Zineb;Rahmouni, Bouchra', author_ids='57212227677;55748344000', author_afids='60026692-120021471;60026692-120021471', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2019', publicationName='Procedia Computer Science', issn=None, source_id='19700182801', eIssn='18770509', aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume='158', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='877-884', description=\"Many innovative initiatives driven by young entrepreneurs engaged in the creation of high societal impact start-ups emerge.

The study comprises a panel data analysis applied to daily data over the period of August 2016-April 2019, and analysis results show that increases in gold price, oil price and S&P 500 index raise the prices of cryptocurrencies, while increases in 2-year benchmark US Bond interest rate and US Dollar index cause to a fall. This adverse effects of the US Dollar index and US Bond interest rate on the prices of cryptocurrencies indicates that when the value of US Dollar and US Bond yield decrease investors prefer to invest in cryptocurrencies as alternative investment instruments. On the other hand, cryptocurrencies move with a similar trend of stock market index, gold price and oil price which are overall market indicators.

The construction of infrastructures that interfere with the coastal circulation and the sediment transport along the coast (piers, docks, etc.), the destruction of the dunes and other anthropogenic modifications to the beach, are some of the factors that limit the adaptability of the beach system and amplify the risk of erosion and flooding of the coastal land. Coastal defense interventions have historically been based on the construction of rigid works (seawalls, groins, breakwaters, jetties, etc.), which, while protecting the territory, have often shifted the problem of erosion to the neighboring coasts. The paper will present the contents and the first findings of the research project STIMARE (Innovative strategies, monitoring and analysis of the coastal erosion risk), financed by the Italian Ministry of the Environment and the Sea (MATTM), aimed to define strategies for coastal management, based on a strong involvement of the stakeholders, and on the use of innovative or low-costs technologies for coastal monitoring. Methodology is based on data acquisition, numerical modelling, laboratory tests, physical and ecological monitoring. All the information and results will be discussed with the local stakeholders, in order to provide a comprehensive strategy for coastal protection, following the European Marine Strategy framework.

Questionnaire responses derived from employees in Chinese technology-driven firms were used to perform the statistical analysis and test the hypotheses drawn in this study. The individual's engagement in cooperative behaviors was proven to be rather unbiased among colleagues. Likewise, those dynamics led to positive perceptions of trust among them and added to the innovation capability of firms while an individual's years of experience didn't influence those dynamics. The present article examined two knowledge-sharing approaches used to ease cooperative behaviors among staff members. However, it is also necessary to examine the influence of other approaches in order to generate more precise comparisons of the frameworks that can yield better results. It is suggested that Chinese firms adopt a more reflexive learning approach that would facilitate individual's engagement in cooperative behavior that lead to innovation.

In order to conceptualize and optimize the role of software architectures for IoTs, there is a dire need for research efforts to analyse the existing research and solutions to formulate the vision for futuristic research and development. In this research, we propose to empirically analyse and taxonomically classify the impacts of research on designing, architecting, and developing IoT-driven software systems. We have conducted a survey-based study of the existing research - investigating challenges, solutions and required futuristic efforts - on architecting IoT systems. The results of survey highlight that software architecture solutions support various research themes for IoT systems such as (i) cloud-based ecosystems, (ii) reference architectures, (ii) autonomous systems, and (iv) agent-based systems for IoT-based software. The results also indicate that any futuristic vision to architect IoT software should incorporate architectural processes, patterns, models and languages to support reusable, automated, and efficient development of IoTs.

Designers used semantic difference (SD) method and principal component analysis (PCA) method to quantify and reduce the dimensions of the extracted perceptual vocabulary, which aimed to select the comprehensive variables that represented the user's needs. TRIZ theory was used in the product emotional intention to elaborate the invention principle of products' appearance structure and functional technology, and improvement explanation was put forward based on further contradiction analysis. Then, the industrial design theory was combined with the innovation design of agricultural machinery products. In order to explain the reliability of innovative design, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used in objective assessment.

(Tennyson & Jorczak, 2008). Board games are enjoyable and promote team collaboration and communication. On one hand, board game scenarios and premises are very dissimilar to business realities, on the other hand, business simulators are useful in developing decision-making, problem-solving, and information literacy skills, but their formats on computer screens may seem cold and distant. This project extracts the best features of both board games and business simulators to create an exci ting learning experience in a new game called “Undertaking.” Qualitative research was conducted using post-game interviews with 130 students. Then, a pre-game and post-game surveys were designed and tested based on validated scales for 21st-century skills (Chai et al., 2015; Cevik, 2019; Soh, Osman & Arsad, 2012). The quantitative data will be gathered with pre-game and post-game surveys applied to 150 students during November 2019.

Conclusion: The future widespread use of SFGC technology will depend on improved guidelines for design and construction as well as innovative development of more durable materials.\", authkeywords='Climate change | Coastal structures | Durability | Geotextile | Innovation', citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85074973667', doi='10.1016/j.procs.2019.05.078', pii='S1877050919307379', pubmed_id=None, title='The Future Exchange of Digital Engineering Data and Models: An Enterprise Systems Analysis', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='McDermott T.', afid='60027392;60026610;60020583;60019647', affilname='Stevens Institute of Technology;Clemson University;The University of Alabama in Huntsville;Georgia Institute of Technology', affiliation_city='Hoboken;Clemson;Huntsville;Atlanta', affiliation_country='United States;United States;United States;United States', author_count='4', author_names='McDermott, Tom;Collopy, Paul;Nadolski, Molly;Paredis, Christiaan', author_ids='57203566959;6603027864;56830429700;35577162900', author_afids='60027392;60020583;60019647;60026610', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2019', publicationName='Procedia Computer Science', issn=None, source_id='19700182801', eIssn='18770509', aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume='153', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='260-267', description=\"In the process of the Defense Department's Digital Engineering transformation, a series of innovation programs and challenges will need to be sponsored that lead to an evolutionary transformation of the defense engineering and acquisition enterprise. The DoD should pursue a set of development/investment opportunities in the areas that have the most impact on short and long term transformative change. A critical innovation impact area is the process of digital information exchange. In a study to address this transformation process, we used the systemigram method to create a conceptual model of a likely future digital information exchange process emerging from the department's strategy. The systemigram process creates a holistic view of the outcomes of enterprise change for the stakeholders, who usually only have a small part of the system in their mental models. The systemigram was presented and validated at a Digital Information Exchange Working Group meeting attended by a broad group of government and industry stakeholders. The meeting and accompanying discussions started a process of community agreement on terminology and innovation needs surrounding the exchange of digital system information. This paper presents that systemigram model and discusses the outcomes of the community discussion. For those interested in the future information exchange process, the systemigram provides a first look at the end-to-end business process that should emerge from DoD Digital Engineering initiatives and strategy.

Active Learning was the core learning approach taking PBL as a framework for it. According to the methodology, the students collaboratively identified the steps for project development from the “pizza bike” to the business areas related to it. For instance: visual identity, digital marketing, financial and accountability, manufacturing, etc. After that, the students supported by a tutor proposed teams for each areas identifying team tasks. From the beginning until the last activity, Trello as a VLE was disruptively essential for project organisation as well as their project success.

The bridges will be a first: timber integral bridges without any movement joints or bearings between the superstructure and the concrete abutments. These structures were developed taking into account the efficient use of natural resources as well as the carbon-emissions during the entire life span of the bridge: from the design and manufacturing to maintenance and operation. The body of the bridge is made of block-laminated timber beams and articulates the guiding principle of mass timber: the sequestration of carbon within the massive timber construction.

Hereby, quality and scope of the problem formulation significantly set the frame for innovative and sustainable solutions by structural engineers. While recent problem formulation research scrutinized strategic organizational issues, this paper focuses on problem formulation influencing the work of structural engineers from two aspects: (1) who is responsible for the problem formulation and (2) what is the quality and scope of the problem formulation (does it describe qualities of the expected result or define the structure quantitatively?). Depending on these aspects, the problem formulation restricts the solution space of the engineer to a greater or lesser degree, opening the question whether an optimal degree of freedom to foster engineering innovativeness exists. Three explorative case studies are examined for this purpose: (1) the Elbphilharmonie, an architectural icon, characterized through strong interplay between client and architect; (2) the European Central Bank premises, a high-rise with an integral architecture-engineering-concept that emerged from an extensive competition; (3) the Gänsebachtalbrücke, an engineering structure, influenced significantly by an audit authority. After a brief introduction to problem formulation research and a description of the methodology, a storyline for each case is presented. The initial problem formulations, the problem formulators, the approaches to solve the problem as well as the solution space are analyzed. The cases indicate that to develop innovative structural designs, the structural engineers should be integrated early in the project to be able to shape and participate in the problem formulation process.

The performance of epoxy composites was qualitatively discussed as Poor, Good, and Excellent cases identified and distinguished by the use of the universal Flame Retardancy Index (FRI). Moreover, evaluations were rechecked by considering the UL-94 test data in four groups as V0, V1, V2, and nonrated (NR).

The system uses FO sensors attached to bridge structures to accurately measure and estimate parameters indicative of bridge state online, such as structural strain, thermal response, bending moments, shear/impact loads, and corrosion. Fibridge leverages PARC's low-cost, high-resolution, compact wavelength-shift detection technology and intelligent algorithms in combination with UoM and the stakeholder team's structural engineering know-how to enable effective real-time monitoring, performance management, better reliability, improved safety, and optimized bridge design. While Fibridge is initially targeting road and rail bridges, it will be extendable to other structures with similar maintenance/monitoring pain points. Here we present an overview of the project, enabling technologies, and summarize key results on vehicle load and structural response features detectable, bridge state estimation algorithm development, low-cost optical readout development, and validation test results. An initial proof-of-concept demonstration on a VicRoads highway bridge in Melbourne being monitored with FO sensors has shown promise thus far. At this stage, the technology is being scaled up towards an extended pilot trial on multiple rail, road, and transit bridges in Victoria.

When will SHM transition from a novelty to a decision support platform for Bridge Asset Management. Structural Health Monitoring has been used on major bridges and as a research tool for over 50 years. The instances of its application for long term continuous monitoring are in the 100's. During this period the condition of the world's inventory of bridges has steadily declined. Many industry experts are citing the need for better information to manage bridges in a more productive manner. The industry needs to transition to fact based decision making from engineering judgement based on visual inspection. Do those conditions exist now? How will the industry need to adapt to allow for mainstream implementation of measured performance and a timeline for this innovation. This talk will address the technical, organizational and economic requirements for SHM to become a true innovation and be put into successful and practical use as a tool for managing a bridge fleet over their life cycle. The technological state of SHM as of a couple of years ago and the application of internet of things (IoT) technology to structural health monitoring will be discussed. The minimization of required hardware and decentralized data management are some of the major innovations IoT brings to SHM. A case study involving the continuous monitoring of a fleet of 20 bridges is presented. Field data examples using live loads from traffic to estimate load distribution factors are shown. In addition histograms of traffic induced strains on simply supported short and medium span bridge are presented. Examples are presented of timber, prestressed concrete and steel girder bridges. In summary, continuous monitoring a fleet of bridges is now economically and technologically viable.

In this publication, a function modeling approach is suggested to increase the amount and variety of explored alternatives, since function models (FM) provide greater model flexibility. An enhanced function-means (EF-M) model capable of representing the constraints of the design space as well as alternative designs is created through a reverse engineering process. This model is then used as a basis for the development of a new product variant. This work describes the EF-M model's capabilities for representing the design space and integrating novel solutions into the existing product structure and explains how these capabilities support the exploration of alternative design variants. First-order analyses are executed, and the EF-M model is used to capture and represent already existing design information for further analyses. Based on these findings, a design space exploration approach is developed. It positions the FM as a connection between legacy and novel designs and, through this, allows for the exploration of more diverse product concepts. This approach is based on three steps-decomposition, design, and embodiment-and builds on the capabilities of EF-M to model alternative solutions for different requirements. While the embodiment step of creating the novel product's geometry is still a topic for future research, the design space exploration concept can be used to enable wider, more methodological, and potentially automated design space exploration.\", authkeywords='Concept design | design space exploration | DSM | enhanced function-means modeling | function modeling | radical innovation', citedby_count=20, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherhybridgold', freetoreadLabel='Hybrid Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='2014-00911', fund_sponsor='VINNOVA'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85073688806', doi='10.21315/jcdc2019.24.1.4', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Building and construction research in Malaysia: A bibliometric analysis', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Chan T.K.', afid='60118504', affilname='Faculty of Architecture, Building and Planning', affiliation_city='Melbourne', affiliation_country='Australia', author_count='1', author_names='Chan, Toong Khuan', author_ids='35147515900', author_afids='60118504', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2019', publicationName='Journal of Construction in Developing Countries', issn='18236499', source_id='21000195314', eIssn='21804222', aggregationType='Journal', volume='24', issueIdentifier='1', article_number=None, pageRange='65-84', description='This paper presents a bibliometric analysis of building and construction research authored by researchers reporting an affiliation to institutions in Malaysia from years 2000 to 2015.

Virtual technologies, such as virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR), will increase value creation by combining the strengths of humans and machines. The aim of this paper is to present an approach through which VR/AR with game programming tools can be utilized to boost business and enable new value creation in a world that is developing towards an experience economy. Our design methodology is based on agile innovation principles with fast experimentations that are carried out in co-creation with companies. The practical implementations are considered as multiple case studies. After introducing the current trends in VR/AR, we present our experiences of how these virtual technologies can be applied for CogInfoCom Aided Engineering tasks in various application fields. Despite the increasing popularity of virtual and augmented reality and game technologies, only a small amount of research has examined how they can be utilized professionally in the design processes of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, they provide effective tools for increasing user involvement in new product development and marketing. Based on the case studies, we present our experiences of how SMEs can benefit from virtual technologies by increasing their business agility and flexibility, reducing product design risk, shortening product development time, and enabling new business models.

(Arnold, Clark, Jávorka 2010; Breznik 2015). The resulting high need for technological innovation pushes RTOs to intensify competition for technology leadership in order to sustain market competiveness. In this regard, RTOs must be able to develop technological solutions that translate results from research and science into state-of-the-art products and services. This can only be achieved when technological resources and competences are effectively and efficiently used to build up competitive advantages. (Kröll 2007; Figueiredo 2014; Zehnder 1997) Therefore, the assessment of technological maturity can provide RTOs with information on strengths and weaknesses in their specific technology areas (Kelessidis 2000), on the basis of which technology strategies can be derived to contribute to the development and training of substantial (core) competences (Klappert, Schuh, Aghassi 2011), which in turn improve the quality of unique and differentiating products and services (EARTO 2005).

For that, they used an innovative entrepreneurship approach changing the teaching-learning process. This article aims to identify the factors necessary to implement an innovative entrepreneurial engineering education, as well as explain such factors through literature review. As a result, two major categories of factors are observed, the teaching-learning process and university management. The first one encompasses the role of teachers, students, curriculum, and extracurricular activities. The literature suggests an open speech among students and teachers where they can explore multiple and critical perspectives. The PBL (Project-Based Learning) is recommended as a teaching-learning process. Extracurricular activities like scientific initiation, Incubators, and patents are other factors that contribute to this type of teaching.

As a result higher education and professions are eager to impose their expertises onto, and claim authority within, the domain of innovation. In recent decades, universities and other engineering institutions that are typically associated with technology development, or ‘technology push’, have expanded their research and teaching activities toward the business end of innovation\\xa0– also known as the ‘demand’ or ‘pull’ side. The chapter investigates the new emergent trend in academic institution building where business or demand-oriented competencies are incorporated to engineering curricula. Drawing on the theoretical frameworks of co-production and sociotechnical imaginaries developed by Sheila Jasanoff and others, we analyze how social scientists at the Technical University of Denmark, in response to new demands for autonomous economy within Danish universities, invented the ‘Design and Innovation’ engineering program. Despite its controversial curricular composition, Design and Innovation entailed a revised status for engineering that brought together: creativity; social awareness; and product innovation. The successful implementation of Design & Innovation can be seen as a result of its unique capacity to bring together emphasis on application with new ‘holistic’ visions for higher education. The chapter contributes to contemporary discussions of transformations within the university system and implies that we should look more closely at the interplay between engineering, business and the surrounding society, and how engineering and business are valued, in order to understand the meaning of the engineering-business nexus.', authkeywords='Co-production | Engineering education | Higher education | Innovation | Reform | Sociotechnical imaginaries', citedby_count=3, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85072739171', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Application of the digital innovation and transformation process in zoo gardening facilities', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Wißotzki M.', afid='60003615;114352299', affilname='Universität Rostock;Wismar University of Applied Sciences', affiliation_city='Rostock;Wismar', affiliation_country='Germany;Germany', author_count='2', author_names='Wißotzki, Matthias;Wichmann, Johannes', author_ids='55446925600;57211124738', author_afids='114352299;114352299-60003615', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2019', publicationName='CEUR Workshop Proceedings', issn='16130073', source_id='21100218356', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume='2443', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='83-97', description='In many industrial domains and service sectors, digitalization efforts show first results.

Many manufacturing organizations simply lack the know-how to handle Big Data projects and the corresponding data analysis right. Therefore one simply follows the current trends and buzz words and adopts approaches which are currently en vogue. This approach often leads to less successful projects and several regularly reoccurring patterns of misconceptions can be identified. This paper highlights some of these unsuccessful patterns and introduces some of the work done in the PRO-OPT SMART-DATA research project. The innovation in this data analysis approach is the combination of traditional statistical methods with new Big Data and AI analysis techniques applied to high tech manufacturing. Being able to align process data with the complete metrology data provides amazing new insights into the manufacturing. Furthermore, we will introduce a new visualization technique specifically suited for domains with high amounts of categorical data like semiconductor, photovoltaics, electronics and such. This paper will show how the combination of the statistical data analysis system Cornerstone in conjunction with Apache Spark1 and Apache Cassandra2 provides a good basis for engineering analytics of massive data amounts. By properly nesting the solid mathematical methods in Cornerstone with big data-appropriate infrastructure such as Apache Spark and, in our case, Apache Cassandra, many new analytics issues can be addressed. Analyzes that used to be inefficient due to the sheer volume of data in classically modeled schema's can now be performed through appropriate big-table modeling and provide the ability to provide completely new insights into production data. Those directly impacted the manufacturing procedures and improved the products quality and reliability.

Following a thorough literature review, research on knowledge transfer processes within the education sector remains limited. We still have little guidance on the mechanisms enabling knowledge transfer inside universities, particularly when promoting faculty mobility or hiring international faculty and researchers. This research adopts a single case study method while using Al Akhawayn University in Ifrane, an international higher education institution, as a context of investigation. The study involved international faculty from the schools of engineering, business, and humanities and also Moroccan faculty who received their education abroad to explore the processes of experience and knowledge sharing among diverse workforce and how such processes could lead to creating a space for knowledge transfer that enables in turn better innovation and performance. The findings of this research show the limited knowledge transfer dynamics inside internationally-oriented higher education institutions and demonstrate the importance of adopting human resource development practices as facilitating mechanisms to support knowledge transfer while involving and benefitting various stakeholders. The study suggests different developmental venues for universities to support knowledge transfer from international faculty including teamwork, training and faculty orientation, collaborative research projects, resources and incentives, and industry-oriented educational and consulting programs.

Model-based systems driven product development (or SDPD, for Systems Driven Product Development) has been proposed as a solution based on driving the product lifecycle from the systems requirements and tracing back performance to stakeholders\\' needs through a RFLP (Requirement, Functional, Logical, Physical) traceability process. The SDPD framework integrates system behavioral modeling with downstream product design and manufacturing process practices to support the verification/validation of the systems behavior as products progress through all phases of the lifecycle, as well as the optimization of trade-offs decisions by maintaining the cross-product digital twin and thread for global decision optimization in an efficient and effective way. We have developed an innovative digital manufacturing curriculum (designed around the SDPD paradigm) that is based on the digitalization of the SE (Systems Engineering) process through the integration of modelling and simulation continuum, in the form of Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE), with Product lifecycle management (PLM). At the core of this curriculum is a shift of focus from theory to implementation and practice, through an applied synthesis of engineering fundamentals and systems engineering, that is driven by a state-of-the-art digital innovation platform for product (or system) development consisting of integrated software (digital) tools spanning the complete lifecycle. The curriculum consists of three key components, namely, modelling and simulation continuum, traceability, and digital thread. The curriculum provides a foundation for implementing the digital twin and supports the training of the next generation of engineers for Industry 4.0. The digital manufacturing (or SDPD) framework is applied in the design and optimization of an electric skateboard. The implementation demonstrates: 1) The benefits of digitalization/model-based engineering when developing complex multi-domain products or systems; 2) The ability of students to effectively complete a real-life modern product development within the time line of one semester; 3) The provision of MBSE curriculum for Engineering Education 4.0, characterized by key, integrated skills for the digital enterprise and Industry 4.0.', authkeywords='Digital manufacturing | Digital thread | Industry 4.0 | SDPD', citedby_count=34, openaccess=1, freetoread='repositoryvor', freetoreadLabel='Green', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85072330886', doi='10.4067/S0718-50062019000400013', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Proposal of a thematic and technological tree on agroindustrial engineering as a tool for a prospective study', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Zartha J.W.', afid='60046690', affilname='Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana', affiliation_city='Medellin', affiliation_country='Colombia', author_count='4', author_names='Zartha, Jhon W.;álvarez, Verónica T.;Oviedo, Juan C.;Orozco, Gina L.', author_ids='55823575200;57194832306;57216482993;56656525600', author_afids='60046690;60046690;60046690;60046690', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2019', publicationName='Formacion Universitaria', issn=None, source_id='21100211373', eIssn='07185006', aggregationType='Journal', volume='12', issueIdentifier='4', article_number=None, pageRange='13-26', description='This article presents a thematic and technological tree proposal for Agroindustrial Engineering programs as an input for the development of prospective studies that strengthen their strategic direction.

A particularly important step forcing technological innovations is the increasing requirement of ship energy efficiency. It is expressed by the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI). Another important step towards green shipping is raising the required quality of fuel used for propulsion, the so-called Tier limits. Higher demand of Low Sulfur Fuel Oil resulted in its price rising up by 200% in the past two years. All these aspects increase the importance of ship fuel economy. As a result, the hull resistance reduction plays a significant role in the design process of new vessels. For vessels operating at sites with moderate and rough waves, the shape of the hull and, in particular, the bow section plays an important role. The paper presents results of some of the research carried out as a part of the \"Smart Propulsion System\" research project. The presented stage of the work includes a full-scale CFD simulation for a case study ship redesigned from an as-built V-shaped bulbous bow to three different innovative variants. Changes in the hull form were made in such a way that the redesigned hull versions preserved the main dimensions and hydrostatic parameters of the original design. The paper presents ship resistance analysis on calm water as a part of seakeeping analysis. The scope of the work was full-scale CFD simulations of four innovative hull forms in order to determine total resistance, dynamic trim and sinkage. The influence of bow and stern shape, wetted surface area and waterplane area on total resistance was investigated. Main conclusions were formulated for the novel hull forms being analysed. The scope of further work was formulated, and it included assessment of the combined influence of the ship’s speed and waving conditions on the performance at a specific operational site.

To make the transition we must aspire to develop large, three dimensional and physically and biologically credible models. Biological credibility can be promoted by grounding, as far as possible, the biology in thermodynamics. Thermodynamic principles are known to have predictive power in microbial ecology. However, this in turn requires a model that incorporates pH and chemical speciation. Physical credibility implies plausible mechanics and a connection with the wider environment. Here, we propose a step toward that ideal by presenting an individual based model connecting thermodynamics, pH and chemical speciation and environmental conditions to microbial growth for 5·105 individuals. We have showcased the model in two scenarios: a two functional group nitrification model and a three functional group anaerobic community. In the former, pH and connection to the environment had an important effect on the outcomes simulated. Whilst in the latter pH was less important but the spatial arrangements and community productivity (that is, methane production) were highly dependent on thermodynamic and reactor coupling. We conclude that if IbM are to attain their potential as tools to evaluate the emergent properties of engineered biological systems it will be necessary to combine the chemical, physical, mechanical and biological along the lines we have proposed. We have still fallen short of our ideals because we cannot (yet) calculate specific uptake rates and must develop the capacity for longer runs in larger models. However, we believe such advances are attainable. Ideally in a common, fast and modular platform.

This study attempts to categorize the toxicity profiles of various carbon allotropes, in particular, carbon black, different multi-walled carbon nanotubes, graphene-based materials, and their derivatives. Statistical and machine learning-based approaches were used to identify groups of CNMs with similar pulmonary toxicity responses from a panel of proteins measured in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid samples and with similar pathological outcomes in the lungs. Thus, grouped particles, based on their pulmonary toxicity profiles, were used to select a small set of proteins that could potentially identify and discriminate between the toxicity profiles associated within each group. Specifically, MDC/CCL22 and MIP-3β/CCL19 were identified as common protein markers associated with both toxicologically distinct groups of CNMs. In addition, the persistent expression of other selected protein markers in BAL fluid from each group suggested their ability to predict toxicity in the lungs, i.e. fibrosis and microgranuloma formation.

A foot and ankle are important structural components of a biped robot, while in the case of amputation their proper design is a decisive factor in the recreation of the correct gait stereotype in a person with a prosthesis. The paper presents design solutions of selected biped robots’ foot models. The chosen foot models’ mechanic operation is similar to the biomechanics of the human foot. The work is the review of prosthetic feet dynamics as well. The design of a prosthetic foot begins with the analysis of the biomechanics of a healthy human gait. The gait tests of a healthy person lead to determining correct gait determinants. Determining the angles of flexion of the ankle during walking also shows imperfections of current prostheses and the possibility of eliminating errors in subsequent designs. In addition, research allows to determine the correct trajectory of movement of key points of the body and the value of their accelerations while walking. Gait analysis was performed using the BTS Smart system. When designing a prosthetic foot, it is important to ensure the stability of the gait by positioning a prosthetic foot’s centre of gravity and elasticity as well as taking into account an appropriate ankle drive, including dorsiflexion of the foot, which is often overlooked in design concepts and whose lack can influence the patient’s greater susceptibility to falls. A common feature for prosthetic and robotic feet is to ensure optimal static and dynamic balance.

There are three key stages effectible in the coal industry in the long-range: Digital automation of coal mining, washing and handling; Big Data-based management and pattern recognition (Internet of Things intelligent network arrangement); creation and introduction of artificial brain and robots (industrial cyber-physical system engineering). The main technologies involved in Industry-4.0 are discussed, and their effect on performance of the coal industry is assessed. The rate of introduction of the discussed stages is directly governed by the world energy market conjuncture set, in particular, by scenarios of advancement of the coal industry. For this reason, the authors forecast this advancement by two scenarios (innovation and conservative), depending on predicted oil prices up to 2040. The innovation scenario provides implementation of all three stages of technological development by 2040. The conservative scenario mostly assumes inertia development in the coal industry, with partial implementation of stages 1 and 2 by 2040, and with transition to large-scale engineering of cyber-physical systems in the distant future. For each scenario, coal production is forecasted per basins and deposits in Russia up to 2040. The predicted coal outputs are obtained using the simulation model named Production of Coal designed at the Energy Research Institute, RAS. The model takes into account planned performance of coal mines and holdings in terms of commissioning of new capacities, launching of new production, technical upgrading, closure and sale of structural subdivisions. For the forecasts of coal production dynamics, predicted price levels for coal are set per basins, deposits and grades of coal in Russia using the model Marketcoal developed at the Energy Research Institute, RAS. The model includes regional volumes of coal mining in 2000-2040, current prices of coal (on-site) and fluctuations of global oil market price.

A serious state policy is needed to create research centers around which the work on the introduction of innovations into production would be concentrated. Budget funds allocated for solving scientific and technical problems of the industry are scattered among scientific organizations to solve minor, private issues, which does not allow solving problems of strategic nature for innovative development of the timber industry complex.

This task is made challenging in part because of the tendency of new technologies to traverse a sequentially downward path of gradually lowering costs and prices, which limits their initial availability and affordability, crimping market coverage and revenues. Academic/practical relevance: We focus on the product management challenge of juggling revenues and profits, show how it is amplified in a supply chain, and propose a new degree of freedom in a supply chain, namely innovation investment anchoring, that offers product managers and their firms the ability to expand market coverage and improve both revenues and profits. Methodology: We adopt a sequential game theory approach to analyze the investment anchor decision for various objectives from investments in innovation to market coverage to profit. Results: We find that the investment anchoring approach can lead to greater investments in innovation, revenues, and profits. We also compare the investment anchoring for two types of innovation, product quality improvement and cost reduction, and show that the investment anchoring is more effective for product quality improvement. Managerial implications: Our findings have subtle but important implications for firms launching innovative products and aspiring to expand product sales and profits. Specifically, innovating firms in a supply chain by broadening the quest for an investment anchor and offering them incentives to invest as well as fine tuning the level of innovation investment with the market context can make innovation more inclusive, alleviate supply chain distortions, and streamline revenues and profits.', authkeywords='Inclusive innovation | Investment anchor | New product development | Supplier enabled innovation | Technology supply chain', citedby_count=17, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85068780889', doi='10.4324/9780429456510', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Design for sustainability: A multi-level framework from products to socio-technical systems', subtype='bk', subtypeDescription='Book', creator='Ceschin F.', afid='60103653;60020623', affilname='Aalto University;Brunel University London', affiliation_city='Espoo;Uxbridge', affiliation_country='Finland;United Kingdom', author_count='2', author_names='Ceschin, Fabrizio;Gaziulusoy, İdil', author_ids='35797110100;56748004600', author_afids='60020623;60103653', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='1 January 2019', publicationName='Design for Sustainability: A Multi-level Framework from Products to Socio-Technical Systems', issn=None, source_id='21100940356', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Book', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='1-172', description='This book discusses the most significant ways in which design has been applied to sustainability challenges using an evolutionary perspective. It puts forward an innovation framework that is capable of coherently integrating multiple design for sustainability (DfS) approaches developed so far. It is now widely understood that design can and must play a crucial role in the societal transformations towards sustainability. Design can in fact act as a catalyst to trigger and support innovation, and can help to shape the world at different levels: from materials to products, product–service systems, social organisations and socio-technical systems. This book offers a unique perspective on how DfS has evolved in the past decades across these innovation levels, and provides insights on its promising and necessary future development directions. For design scholars, this book will trigger and feed the academic debate on the evolution of DfS and its next research frontiers. For design educators, the book can be used as a supporting tool to design courses and programmes on DfS. For bachelor’s and master’s level design, engineering and management students, the book can be a general resource to provide an understanding of the historical evolution of DfS. For design practitioners and businesses, the book offers a rich set of practical examples, design methods and tools to apply the various DfS approaches in practice, and an innovation framework which can be used as a tool to support change in organisations that aim to integrate DfS in their strategy and processes.

However, few studies have examined how Black engineering and computing doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers experience these challenges and stressors or focused on the psychological effects, behavioral responses, or health costs for these students. We interviewed 48 Black PhD students and postdoctoral researchers in engineering and computing departments to find out how they describe, make sense of, and cope with stressors and strains in their training programs. Study participants (29 men and 19 women) ranged from first-year doctoral students to recent PhDs. Students attended various institutions and institution types, primarily in eastern and central time zones. Nine participants attended historically Black colleges and universities, and though we anticipated that their experiences would be vastly different, their experiences closely resembled those of students in other institutions. Research Design: Each person participated in either an individual interview or focus group. Data were collected via video- and audio-recording. All focus groups took place at either a national engineering-/computing-related conference or at the students' home institutions. Twentythree participants were interviewed, while the remainder participated in focus groups of three to five students (maximum of ten). Interviews and focus groups were semistructured, using openended questions but allowing some flexibility to develop new ideas and order topics differently. Data Collection and Analysis: This study employed transcendental phenomenology, using three steps to investigate and make meaning of participants' experiences: examining the phenomenon with intentionality, eidetic reduction, and constitution of meaning. Transcendental reduction allowed for examining the experience of Black doctoral students in engineering and computing in general and separating what the research perspectives supplied from what our intuitions offered, guided by our theoretical frameworks of role strain and racial battle fatigue. Transcendental phenomenology also gave the authors a context to examine and disclose our own experiences and feelings. Findings: Consistent with prior research on role strain and John Henryism (i.e., trying to overcome a chronic stressor by working harder), we found that seeking success in training, employment, work, or career was more important to these Black graduate students and postdocs than safeguarding their mental or physical health. Meeting the demands of a PhD program or postdoctoral fellowship were critical priorities congruent with their phase of life. Their focus and sacrifice may have helped them complete their degrees, but our findings suggest that these strategies exacted psychological, emotional, and physical costs. The study deepened our understanding of significant interrelated dynamics for this population in four key ways. We found that (a) the stresses and strains made students question their qualifications; (b) racialized experiences were often the source of stress, strain, and academic performance anxiety; (c) discordance between the racial make-up of their academic environments and their racialized engineering and computing identities appeared to exacerbate impostor phenomenon; and (d) the students' proactive coping mechanisms took an emotional toll. Participants discussed the nature and sources of their feelings of self-doubt. The implications extend beyond the dwindling numbers of Black students earning STEM doctorates; this racial climate also affects the academic workforce and the professional landscape. Although Black researchers who leave academia after completing doctoral training can influence scientific innovation through other positions, it is alarming and problematic that potentially qualified future professors are dissuaded from pursuing academic careers because of their training experiences. Their absence from faculty can hinder critical innovation, breakthroughs, and the training of succeeding generations of scholars who might have learned from and collaborated with them. Conclusions and Recommendations: The added stress, strain, and toll on Black students' well-being is an underappreciated reason for their relinquishing of academic careers. Our findings illustrate the students' resilience and strength. Continued research on added stressors (e.g., impostor syndrome, racialized stress) and strengths could add much-needed consideration of cultural, structural, and interpersonal racism and the ways that Black students earning doctoral degrees in STEM fields manage to succeed despite cultural and institutional barriers. Future research should explore how to modify the microculture of STEM programs and departments to allow Black students to feel that these are healthy, safe, and fair spaces in which they can make contributions. Otherwise, an invaluable diversity of perspectives may disappear altogether from academic environments. In addition, diversifying the faculty and students in doctoral engineering and computing programs could help to reduce impostor syndrome, isolation, and other damaging psychological stress. Forthcoming research, programs, and policies should consider what Black students in STEM endure, because simply surviving racially toxic environments should not be the end goal.\", authkeywords=None, citedby_count=98, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85068392454', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Guidelines for the implementation of UNE 166000 standards for R&D&I management in the Chilean municipal public sector', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Meléndez Araya N.M.', afid='60012992;122799422', affilname='Universidad de Atacama;Municipalidad de Vallenar', affiliation_city='Copiapo;', affiliation_country='Chile;Chile', author_count='2', author_names='Meléndez Araya, Nahur M.;Paz, Pedro Zamarca', author_ids='57202984516;57209656814', author_afids='60012992;60012992-122799422', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2019', publicationName='XIV Jornadas Iberoamericanas de Ingenieria de Software e Ingenieria del Conocimiento, JIISIC 2019', issn=None, source_id='21100914911', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='43-54', description='Research, development and innovation (R&D&I) are essential activities, intimately linked to human beings and their organizational structures.

This is the case also for the application and embedding phases. If not widely applied in practice, the innovations do not give their full potential. If the process is totally aborted, all the investments in research and prototyping are done in vain, and the projected benefits of the new solutions are not realized at all. To avoid unnecessary losses, it is important that users accept the developed products. The technologies need first to be purchased, and then used in a proper manner so that their benefits are realized, so that the users return to buy again. According to recent research, an important buying criterion of new solutions in agriculture is usability. Usable products have a good combination of ease-of-use, learnability, and efficiency. They also operate with few errors. Finally, they are subjectively pleasing. User-Centred Design (UCD) is a methodology for designing usable technologies and services. It is widely utilized to ensure better end-user acceptance. Inclusion of end-users in innovation makes the products more suitable for the users' variable situations. UCD also builds the users' trust on the solutions. Eventually, UCD reduces the need for iteration in the process, thus speeding up the innovation. Multi-Actor Approach (MAA) brings different kinds of people together to develop solutions. Best results are achieved when the participants have long enough cognitive distances. MAA speeds up the innovation processes as the products have been assessed from several angles. The probability for reaching a winning product arises. In the paper examples are given on UCD and MAA in the design of agricultural solutions. Two projects of the author, an OECD-CRP and an H2020 funded research on how to speed up and support innovation in agriculture, are referred. Recommendations on how to enhance the usage of these methods are given.\", authkeywords='Agriculture | Engineering | Innovation | Multi-Actor Approach | User-Centred Design', citedby_count=0, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfree2read', freetoreadLabel='Bronze', fund_acr='H2020', fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='Horizon 2020 Framework Programme'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85067057113', doi='10.1146/annurev-bioeng-060418-052130', pii=None, pubmed_id='30525930', title='Exploring Dynamics and Structure of Biomolecules, Cryoprotectants, and Water Using Molecular Dynamics Simulations: Implications for Biostabilization and Biopreservation', subtype='re', subtypeDescription='Review', creator='Weng L.', afid='60029929;60005532;60002746', affilname='Massachusetts General Hospital;Shriners Hospitals for Children;Harvard Medical School', affiliation_city='Boston;Tampa;Boston', affiliation_country='United States;United States;United States', author_count='3', author_names='Weng, Lindong;Stott, Shannon L.;Toner, Mehmet', author_ids='36496220000;8220345200;7102638942', author_afids='60029929;60029929-60002746;60029929-60005532', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2019', publicationName='Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering', issn='15239829', source_id='13037', eIssn='15454274', aggregationType='Book Series', volume='21', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='1-31', description='Successful stabilization and preservation of biological materials often utilize low temperatures and dehydration to arrest molecular motion.

Recently, there has been a rising trend of employing unsupervised machine learning using unstructured raw network data to improve network performance and provide services, such as traffic engineering, anomaly detection, Internet traffic classification, and quality of service optimization. The growing interest in applying unsupervised learning techniques in networking stems from their great success in other fields, such as computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and optimal control (e.g., for developing autonomous self-driving cars). In addition, unsupervised learning can unconstrain us from the need for labeled data and manual handcrafted feature engineering, thereby facilitating flexible, general, and automated methods of machine learning. The focus of this survey paper is to provide an overview of applications of unsupervised learning in the domain of networking. We provide a comprehensive survey highlighting recent advancements in unsupervised learning techniques, and describe their applications in various learning tasks, in the context of networking. We also provide a discussion on future directions and open research issues, while identifying potential pitfalls.

So far it is clear that the intervention of laboratory practices as learning strategies, guarantee a solid education for students in engineering. These practices are the scenarios where the student verifies the theoretical knowledge and validates with real results the application of mathematical and statistical models, which are set around a specific learning in engineering. Continue the development of these activities not only in a traditional way, but including innovations that the same engineering allows from the use of different technologies is a challenge, which can be assumed with the application of the same discipline and be projected to other fields of the education, to facilitate personalized and asynchronous learning.

It can match the complexity and cellular microenvironment of human organs and tissues, which drives much of the interest in this technique. However, most of the preliminary evaluations of 3Dprinted tissues and organ engineering, including cardiac tissue, relies extensively on the lessons learned from traditional tissue engineering.

Reservoir prediction is difficult especially in the deep depth oilfields because of low seismic resolution. In addition, how to quantitatively characterize the risk of new oilfield development and how to build a more elaborate model in the late period of oilfield development are particularly challenging. This paper developed an innovative workflow for complex clastic reservoir characterization of offshore oilfield. A modeling method based on sedimentary evolution simulation, which can provide modeling constraints, is proposed for deep depth oilfields. Through sedimentary evolution modeling and other information, reservoir and structure uncertainty are analyzed, then reserves scale and reservoir connectivity are evaluated through experimental design, geological modeling and streamline simulation; 3p models are selected lastly. A new method is proposed for building an elaborate model of old oilfield with less grid amounts. The fluid seepage effect caused by some small scale configuration units is characterized by a parameter similar to fault transmissibility multiplier data in numerical simulation model, for there is no actual modeling of the configuration units, so the operation efficiency is greatly improved. BZ3 oilfield is a deep depth delta oilfield. A geological model was established for exploration evaluation well placement, reserves evaluation and development plan research based on sedimentary evolution simulation and quantitative uncertainty evaluation, the reservoir prediction accuracy is greatly improved that is confirmed by new drilled wells. Through quantitative uncertainty evaluation, reliable geological basis was provided for engineering investment, which can avoid the investment waste caused by geological uncertainty. Q32 oilfield is a fluvial oilfield that has come into high watercut (86.7%). How to characterize the lateral accretion interlayer (often less than 1 meter) in model for fine remaining oil distribution prediction is difficult, thus the method mentioned above for old oilfield was used. Firstly, a conventional geological model was established, then the lateral accretion interlayer was extracted as interface from it based on configuration results, then the interface was used to extract the parameter named transmissibility multiplier data in the numerical simulation model; a software has been compiled to perform the whole process. Based on the method, more than 100 adjusting wells were disposed and better production results were obtained. These geological modeling techniques have been widely applied in Bohai Bay offshore oilfields in different periods of oilfield development, including BZ2, JZ2, KL10, CFD6, SZ3, and JZ9. This ensures that these oilfield developed with high quality and efficiency.', authkeywords=None, citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='CNOOC', fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='China National Offshore Oil Corporation'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85066613182', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Maximizing tax incentives for offshore exploration and production efforts following the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Riebe C.', afid='122654988', affilname='ABGi USA', affiliation_city=None, affiliation_country='United States', author_count='3', author_names='Riebe, Craig S.;Sanchez, Amanda R.;Blake Windhorst, J.', author_ids='57209137206;57209141428;57209133677', author_afids='122654988;122654988;122654988', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2019', publicationName='Proceedings of the Annual Offshore Technology Conference', issn='01603663', source_id='110624', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume='2019-May', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description='The tax changes introduced under the newly-enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Act\") are complex, but various provisions can be leveraged to produce direct financial benefits for innovative companies in the energy industry. Cutting edge technologies and innovations related to offshore renewable energy, robotics, automation, oilfield digitalization, geotechnical engineering, and other technical areas are critical to the growth of the energy industry. Understanding how the new provisions interrelate is essential to maximizing the Act\\'s valuable tax incentives for offshore exploration and production companies in the United States. The Act maintains the permanency of the Research and Development Tax Credit in § 41 of the Internal Revenue Code (\"IRC\"), reduces the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminates the alternative minimum tax for certain entities, limits the net operating loss deduction to 80% of taxable income, and repeals the existing carryback and carryforward provisions under IRC § 172. This paper will discuss the legal implications of the new Act and provide methods and tax strategies that will directly impact energy companies\\' return on investment and strengthen offshore exploration and production efforts. Perhaps most notably, since the Research and Development Tax Credit (\"RTC\") remains permanent, companies in the industry may recover qualified research expenditures related to the development of new or improved products, processes, formulas, inventions, techniques, and software. The RTC is a highly valuable incentive that directly impacts a company\\'s tax liability both at the federal level and in certain states. Because of the reduced corporate tax rate, the changes related to net operating losses, and the elimination of the alternative minimum tax for certain entities, this credit provides a powerful incentive for many energy companies. In addition, since the Act will soon require taxpayers to capitalize and amortize expenditures related to qualified research conducted outside of the United States over a period of 15 years, companies performing critical research in the United States may soon be able to realize an additional current year deduction if certain expenditures are characterized differently under IRC § 162. Creating a tax strategy that incorporates the RTC and related provisions in the Act may result in a valuable benefit to energy clients creating and utilizing intellectual property throughout the world.', authkeywords=None, citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85066433701', doi='10.1358/dof.2019.44.3.2970908', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='18<sup>th</sup> annual PepTalk: The protein science week – Antibody–drug conjugates: Next-gen engineering', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Croasdell G.', afid='60121806', affilname='Clarivate Analytics', affiliation_city='Philadelphia', affiliation_country='United States', author_count='1', author_names='Croasdell, G.', author_ids='6507391714', author_afids='60121806', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2019', publicationName='Drugs of the Future', issn='03778282', source_id='21265', eIssn='20130368', aggregationType='Journal', volume='44', issueIdentifier='3', article_number=None, pageRange='241-245', description='The Cambridge Healthtech Institute’s (CHI) 18th Annual PepTalk Conference was dedicated to proteins, covering their engineering, production and applications in medicine.

Experiments carried out at the Institute of Structural Engineering at TU Wien showed the high potential of structural elements reinforced with epoxy impregnated textile reinforcement. However a spalling of the concrete cover due to high bond stresses could be observed in most cases, subsequently leading to premature failure of the test specimens. Based on this observation further tests on the bond performance of textile reinforcement bonded in high performance concrete were carried out using a special bond performance test adapted for textile reinforcement in particular. The research described in this paper shows that the roving geometry and the production process of the textile reinforcement is responsible for high splitting forces orthogonal to the textile layer, resulting in a spalling of the concrete cover.

In this paper, we proposed a method based on a knowledge network for constructing the temporal-weighted user innovation knowledge map. In order to model the temporal-weighted co-occurrence relationship among knowledge points, we assigned different weights to the knowledge points at different periods. Then, we carried out centrality analysis and core subgroup analysis for knowledge points through using a time-dynamic analysis method to explore the dynamic laws. Based on that, we proposed the periodical growth rule of user innovation hotspots. It was convenient to predict the hot spots of innovation and grasp the pace of innovation.

We applied the established model to explore the sensitivity and accuracy of the knowledge map after adding the temporal factor to the user innovation knowledge map, and we found out the evolution process of co-occurrence relationship between user innovation knowledge points. Finally, we concluded that it takes time to ultimately establish a core-edge innovation knowledge model to represent specific innovation fields.

This paper reports the results of an exploratory mixed-methods study involving successful technology innovation leaders who were identified through peer-referenced snowball sampling. Qualitative research triangulated expert opinions, case materials, workshops results and the literature to identify leadership competencies. A measurement instrument was developed for the quantitative research, which involved eligible respondents rating the significance of identified leader behaviours.

The partners agreed to use Learning Factory focus areas along with DIME learning modules to stimulate international collaboration. Furthermore, they identified several research areas within the framework of the DIME program to encourage horizontal and vertical collaboration. Vertical collaboration connects faculty expertise across the Learning Factory network to advance knowledge in one of the focus areas, while Horizontal collaboration connects knowledge and expertise across multiple focus areas. Together they offer a platform for students to develop disciplinary and cross-disciplinary applied research skills necessary for addressing the complex challenges faced by industry. Hence, the university partners have the opportunity to develop the learning factory capabilities in alignment with the smart manufacturing concept. The learning factory is thus an important pillar in this venture.

The main goal of the study was to develop a new typology that will help to advance knowledge of metrics and facilitate their use in machine learning regression algorithms Background Performance metrics (error measures) are vital components of the evaluation frameworks in various fields. A performance metric can be defined as a logical and mathematical construct designed to measure how close are the actual results from what has been expected or predicted. A vast variety of performance metrics have been described in academic literature. The most commonly mentioned metrics in research studies are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), etc. Knowledge about metrics properties needs to be systematized to simplify the design and use of the metrics. Methodology A qualitative study was conducted to achieve the objectives of identifying related peer-reviewed research studies, literature reviews, critical thinking and inductive reasoning. Contribution The main contribution of this paper is in ordering knowledge of performance metrics and enhancing understanding of their structure and properties by proposing a new typology, generic primary metrics mathematical formula and a visualization chart Findings Based on the analysis of the structure of numerous performance metrics, we proposed a framework of metrics which includes four (4) categories: primary metrics, extended metrics, composite metrics, and hybrid sets of metrics. The paper identified three (3) key components (dimensions) that determine the structure and properties of primary metrics: method of determining point distance, method of normalization, method of aggregation of point distances over a data set. For each component, implementation options have been identified. The suggested new typology has been shown to cover a total of over 40 commonly used primary metrics Recommendations Presented findings can be used to facilitate teaching performance metrics to for Practitioners university students and expedite metrics selection and implementation processes for practitioners Recommendations By using the proposed typology, researchers can streamline development of for Researchers new metrics with predetermined properties Impact on Society The outcomes of this study could be used for improving evaluation results in machine learning regression, forecasting and prognostics with direct or indirect positive impacts on innovation and productivity in a societal sense Future Research Future research is needed to examine the properties of the extended metrics, composite metrics, and hybrid sets of metrics. Empirical study of the metrics is needed using R Studio or Azure Machine Learning Studio, to find associations between the properties of primary metrics and their “numerical” behavior in a wide spectrum of data characteristics and business or research requirements.', authkeywords='Accuracy measures | Classification | Dissimilarity | Distance | Error measures | Estimation | Evaluation | Forecasting | Machine learning | Modeling | Performance metrics | Prediction | Prognostics | Properties | Regression | Similarity | Typology', citedby_count=403, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85065462903', doi='10.1007/978-3-030-14969-7_3', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='The Team Process Capability Model: A Sociotechnical Theoretical Framework for Understanding How Teams Interact with Their Environment', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Sexe F.', afid='60016918', affilname='Southern New Hampshire University', affiliation_city='Manchester', affiliation_country='United States', author_count='1', author_names='Sexe, Frederick S.', author_ids='57208666196', author_afids='60016918', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2019', publicationName='Springer Proceedings in Mathematics and Statistics', issn='21941009', source_id='21100255398', eIssn='21941017', aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume='280', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='21-32', description='Numerous examples exist where teams and organizations perform at a high level only to see performance decrease over time. This phenomenon can be observed in manufacturing and engineering organizations where teams provide value to organizations through the use of tools, processes, and procedures to address customer needs. The rapid acceleration of digital innovations aimed at making teams more effective have actually compounded these problems by increasing the complexity of a task while ignoring the capability of the team to harness these new tools. The aim of this paper is to provide managers with a theoretical analysis of how sociotechnical interactions influence team and organizational performance within a larger context of environmental demands. This paper will propose a team process capability model to explain how dynamic social and technical interactions coupled with organizational decision-making influence team and organizational performance. The model will illustrate how team social and technical system interactions are influenced by managerial decisions which subsequently influences its performance. The concept of requisite process capability will be introduced to the reader within the context of resiliency factors such as dynamic capability and environmental uncertainty.

The study consists of a sequential mixed method where first key performance indicator, drawn from preliminary interviews and then the data from 2012 to 2016 are collected and analysed. The results are interpreted by conducting in-depth interviews with performance management departments. This study uses various performance indicators for R&D oriented sectors combining them with the new KPIs that are specific to the software sector. The implemented method is used to rank the performance of a software company effectively. The study offers many performance-oriented interrelationships between financial, innovation, education, customer-oriented, and organisational factors. The study also offers interesting findings, related to the quality-versus-quantity measures indicating highly qualified employees lead to higher quality levels in research and patent applications rather than a higher number of outputs.', authkeywords='Performance management | Performance measurement | R&D management | Software sector', citedby_count=3, openaccess=0, freetoread='repositoryam', freetoreadLabel='Green', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85065085741', doi='10.4018/JCIT.2019070105', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Artificial intelligence, smart classrooms and online education in the 21st century: Implications for human development', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Wogu I.A.P.', afid='60103980;60042282', affilname='Covenant University;Kaunas University of Technology', affiliation_city='Ota;Kaunas', affiliation_country='Nigeria;Lithuania', author_count='6', author_names='Wogu, Ikedinachi A.P.;Misra, Sanjay;Assibong, Patrick A.;Olu-Owolabi, Esther Fadeke;Maskeliūnas, Rytis;Damasevicius, Robertas', author_ids='56964387400;56962766700;57202073672;57208546329;27467587600;6603451290', author_afids='60103980;60103980;60103980;60103980;60042282;60042282', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2019', publicationName='Journal of Cases on Information Technology', issn='15487717', source_id='88934', eIssn='15487725', aggregationType='Journal', volume='21', issueIdentifier='3', article_number=None, pageRange='66-79', description='The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in the education sector has largely taken over conventional classrooms and revolutionized the way education is conducted to the admiration of many.

mineral resources, for example, titanium, thorium, uranium and thorium, as well as some rare minerals such as pyroxferroite and zircon that do not exist on the earth.The exploitation and utilization of those resources can effectively solve the current global issues of resource depletion and environmental damage, which has become the focus of the new round of global space exploitation competition.However, the special gravity, vacuum and temperature environment on the moon, together with the distinctive composition, structure and geometric characteristics of geological materials result in the individual mechanical behaviour and engineering response of lunar regolith and rock, which bring a series of unprecedented challenges on both lunar mining and base construction.In terms of space environment, the gravity on the moon is only 1/6 of that on the earth, the vacuum on the lunar surface exceeds 1.01×10-12 kPa, the highest temperature is up to 130℃, the lowest is -183℃, and the temperature difference is as high as 313℃.As for the lunar geological materials, the particle shape of lunar regolith processes typical porous and multi-hook geometric characteristic.The lunar regolith also has a very large particle size variation, and exhibits a typical regolith/rock mixed structure characteristic because of the existing of large lunar rock bulk.Both the lunar regolith and rock demonstrate significant titanium-rich and iron-rich composition characteristics.Therefore, the systematic understanding of the above factors induced mechanical behaviours of lunar regolith and rock is the premise for the safe and efficient lunar mining.Those mechanical issues include the behaviour of lunar regolith/rock under lunar gravity induced low stress level and low stress gradient, the behaviour of lunar regolith/rock under lunar ultra-high vacuum and extreme temperature environments, the behaviour of lunar regolith related to abnormal particle shape, and the behaviour of lunar regolith/rock related to the distinctive composition and structure characteristics.Therefore, several theoretical and experimental innovative research methods need to be put forward, which can effectively make up for the incapability and shortcoming of current research methods.In theoretical aspects, the stress gradient-related high-order mechanical theory for lunar regolith/rock needs to be proposed to characterize the behaviour of lunar regolith/rock under gravity induced low stress gradient.The mathematical representation and numerical reconstruction of lunar regolith particle is another theoretical innovation, which may help to reveal the complex particle shape of lunar regolith and its influence on mechanical properties.Furthermore, the abnormal particle shape-related multiscale mechanical theory for lunar regolith should be developed to build the connection between its microscopic particle shape and macroscopic mechanical behaviour.In the experimental aspect, both the terrestrial experimental techniques used to simulate the lunar space environment and used to prepare lunar regolith/rock simulants need to be carried out, which can provide a basic experimental platform for lunar mining related mechanical issues.', authkeywords='Extreme temperature | Low gravitational field | Lunar mining | Lunar regolith | Lunar rock | Mechanical behaviour | Ultra-high

Today, a modern state needs people capable to regular intensive implementation of innovative activity in order to keep competitiveness in a dynamically changing world that is undergoing a significant increase in the amount of new information and its fast obsolescence. The need of modern economy for innovators inevitably leads to the shift of priorities in education from memorising and reproducing of a specified amount of knowledge to the development of students’ independent thinking, which, accordingly, requires teachers’ certain qualities and critical mentality. The aim of the research was to identify the components of critical thinking important for innovative activity and search for the ways of development of these components in young teachers, entering a master’s programme Modern Natural Science. Methodology and research methods. In the course of the research, the methods of the analysis and synthesis of scientific and scientific-methodological publications devoted to the development of higher order thinking skills and the concept of STEM education (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) were employed. The assessment of the level of students’ thinking and its changes was carried out through diagnostic tasks and empirical observation of educational and project-based activity of undergraduates and school students. Results and scientific novelty. The key components of critical thinking for the implementation and realisation of innovative activities were identified: creative, rational, logical, reflexive and metacognitive. To assess the development of components, a set of problem-situational tasks (STEM cases) was developed. Diagnostic tools were introduced to measure the level of critical thinking skills formation. The authors described the methodology for working with STEM cases through the example of the development and presentation of hybrid technology of lifting the sunken ship with a damaged hull, based on the students’ understanding of characteristics of the aggregate state of water. The results of approbation of the presented methodology used in small groups at various educational levels prove that its implementation contributes to the development of critical thinking in students, if the plots of cues are based on real problems of science and technology, and the solution requires contextual use of educational material, building a mathematical model, generating rational ideas of new or improved technologies. Practical significance. The research demonstrates the possibilities of acquisition by students of higher order thinking skills within the studied academic disciplines in the natural-science cycle without introduction of a special course in educational programmes.', authkeywords='Case studies | Critical thinking | Innovation | Natural science literacy | STEM education | Technology of lifting ships by freezing', citedby_count=21, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85064710487', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Project based learning and biomedical devices: The Ubora approach towards an international community of developers focused on open source medical devices', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Lantada A.D.', afid='60028442', affilname='Universidad Politécnica de Madrid', affiliation_city='Madrid', affiliation_country='Spain', author_count='1', author_names='Lantada, Andres Diaz', author_ids='16319177900', author_afids='60028442', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2019', publicationName='BIODEVICES 2019 - 12th International Conference on Biomedical Electronics and Devices, Proceedings; Part of 12th International Joint Conference on Biomedical Engineering Systems and Technologies, BIOSTEC 2019', issn=None, source_id='21100904237', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='7-13', description='The engineering design of successful medical devices relies on several key factors and constitutes an extremely challenging process, which requires from multidisciplinary collaboration.

The teaching learning processes, through which the trainees should acquire a broad overview of the medical field and biomedical industry, a well-balanced combination of general and specific knowledge according to the chosen specialization, several technical abilities linked to modern engineering tools and a wide set of professional skills, have to be strategically planned and implemented. Among the existing teaching-learning methodologies that can be employed for providing such holistic training, project-based learning is presented here and illustrated by means of successful experiences. Trends in the field of collaboratively developed open source medical devices (OSMDs) are presented and main current R&D challenges analyzed. To illustrate the OSMD field, the “UBORA” project (meaning “excellence in Swahili) is highlighted as a paradigmatic example, in which research and training aspects are importantly interwoven. In fact, this Euro-African initiative is focused on the promotion of OSMDs by means of innovation through education, by the creation of a sort of “Wikipedia” of medical devices, the “UBORA e-infrastructure”, which also guides designers in the engineering design process and supports online collaboration through the process, and by the constitution of an international community of developers devoted to OSMDs. Results from project-based learning activities within the UBORA project, which include competitions, design schools and final degree theses, are presented. The “UBORA e-infrastructure”, with more than 100 open source biodevices concepts and prototypes already developed in collaboration by a global community of around 350 users, and shared through such online platform, are also analyzed.', authkeywords='Biomedical Engineering (BME) | Co-creation | Collaborative Design | Collective Intelligence | Open Source Medical Devices (OSMD) | Project-based Learning | Service Learning', citedby_count=2, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='UPM', fund_no='731053', fund_sponsor='Universidad Politécnica de Madrid'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85064663378', doi='10.5220/0007696606030610', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Empowering translation of new ideas - A EIT health clinmed summer school overview', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Ribeiro S.', afid='60107871;60027509;60027466;60008539;60005036;60000905;101018916', affilname='Evaluation des Technologies de Santé et des Pratiques Médicales (METRICS);Università degli Studi di Roma \"Tor Vergata\";Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Besançon;University of Galway;Universitätsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf;Inserm;Medtronic', affiliation_city='Lille;Rome;Besancon;Galway;Hamburg;Paris;Boulogne-Billancourt', affiliation_country='France;Italy;France;Ireland;Germany;France;France', author_count='8', author_names='Ribeiro, Sofia;Ricci, Mariachiara;Von Der Lieth, Albert;Bayon, Yves;Zeugolis, Dimitrios I.;Pelayo, Sylvia;Marque, Isabelle;Pazart, Lionel', author_ids='57194114743;57203430490;57208396045;16164863800;23669892300;8439894300;57208389860;7003886372', author_afids='101018916-60008539;60027509;60005036;101018916;60008539;60107871;60000905;60027466', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2019', publicationName='HEALTHINF 2019 - 12th International Conference on Health Informatics, Proceedings; Part of 12th International Joint Conference on Biomedical Engineering Systems and Technologies, BIOSTEC 2019', issn=None, source_id='21100904222', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='603-610', description=\"Translational research training is crucial to convert academic research ideas into efficient real-life solutions.

Current platforms manage the information as data centres (i.e. databases) related to graphical representations located in 3D parametric models. Today, these new technologies are nowadays being incorporated in heritage assets. This paper aims to establish a methodology, based on these efficient platforms, for studying built heritage, including historical and construction aspects by adding the chronology of those interventions made in the historic building. This case study is focused on the Palace of the Children of Don Gome, a historic building located in the city of Andújar, in Jaén (Spain). The interest of this case study lies in the historic innovations and areas added to this palace. Likewise, the collection and manipulation of the graphic information and data related to the interventions have been based on an interoperable 3D graphic model, which allows users to include all the related documentation from different disciplines associated with the conservation and heritage restoration processes. In this paper, the construction process carried out during the last restoration of the building is studied. Specifically, it analyses the last building intervention in 1989, in particular an area of the coffered ceiling slab in the northern nave, located on the first floor. Within this model, all the elements that constitute the roof of the tower, mudwall walls, slabs and coffered ceilings of the northern nave have been studied, using photogrammetry for data acquisition and 3D modelling, and these data are included in a 3D digital model of the building generated using ArchiCAD software. Moreover, the system will be used to improve the management of the information obtained during heritage maintenance, creating a record of the whole building life cycle. As well as the historical documentation and graphical research, and the analysis of the procedures carried out during the last refurbishment of the building, new building construction system proposals have arisen which have been modelled to fulfil the Level Of Development (LOD) 300. Further analysis of these construction solutions used provides knowledge of how large 16th century palaces were built, and the kind of restoration conducted by architects at the end of the 20th century. The results obtained show how current BIM platforms are able to record construction and evolutionary aspects of a building's history, by identifying all the original elements and classifying them before their demolition. Also, by making a detailed inventory of the whole coffered ceiling in which the position and the temporal order (original - later addition) of the elements are included, it is possible to virtually replace those elements in their original positions, reducing the visual impact of the intervention. On the other hand, multiple errors in projects based on graphical systems of representation, mainly Computer-Aided Design (CAD), may derive from contradictions in the official sources consulted, such as the plans of the cadastre, the city council, and those produced through manual measurement procedures. However, in this paper, real graphical documentation has been generated using specific 3D surveying techniques for capturing geometry and accurate measurements, as well as by utilising the BIM system.\", authkeywords='Archaeology of architecture | Arqueología de la arquitectura | BIM | BIM | Fotogrametría | HBIM (Historic Building Information Modelling) Project | Heritage information model | Modelo de información patrimonial | Photogrammetry | Proyecto HBIM (Modelado Histórico de Información para la Construcción)', citedby_count=11, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85064573812', doi='10.1007/978-3-030-15740-1_130', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Research on the Training Path of Building Decoration Engineering Technology Professionals Under the Background of 2025 Manufacturing in China', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Wei A.', afid='110023323', affilname='Guangzhou City Construction College', affiliation_city='Guangzhou', affiliation_country='China', author_count='1', author_names='Wei, Aimin', author_ids='56489859300', author_afids='110023323', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2019', publicationName='Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing', issn='21945357', source_id='5100152904', eIssn='21945365', aggregationType='Book Series', volume='929', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='1007-1014', description='The strong manufacturing industry and economic development in China require workers to have good professional competence and spirit, thus better meet the requirements of the era of “Made in China 2025”, and better develop the ability of vocational education to serve the economy and society.

Even though they reside in one of the most active seismic regions in the world, and have experienced major earthquakes for centuries, some of these structures are still stable. These masterpieces have been sources of research and inquiry about the structural stability, architecture, and the incorporation of the art, spirituality, and construction methods. The architects of these structures were expert in mathematics, geometry, and topography crafting in their era. They also had great knowledge about the climate, materials, and structural systems to assist them in creating the structures. The architects integrated structural principles into their design, maintained creative interaction with the environment, and incorporated robust engineering methods. The combination of structural elements, such as arches and domes, covered wide openings and long spans. This reduced the weight of the buildings by decreasing their mass and supported structural stability. The structural shape, materials, and other considerations lead the structures ability to tolerate the applied loads. Their shapes are inspired by nature and their architects' spiritual and philosophical ideas. The complexity of the geometries, along with the simplification of the concepts and methods, can be investigated by different professional fields.

The OMiLAB ecosystem, which a generalized understanding of “model value” motivates, targets research and education stakeholders who fulfill various roles in a modeling method’s lifecycle. While we have many reports on novel modeling methods and tools for various domains, we lack knowledge on conceptualizing such methods via a full-fledged dedicated open ecosystem and a methodology that facilitates entry points for novices and an open innovation space for experienced stakeholders. This gap continues due to the lack of an open process and platform for 1) conducting research in the field of modeling method design, 2) developing agile modeling tools and model-driven digital products, and 3) experimenting with and disseminating such methods and related prototypes. OMiLAB incorporates principles, practices, procedures, tools, and services required to address the issues above since it focuses on being the operational deployment for a conceptualization and operationalization process built on several pillars: 1) a granularly defined “modeling method” concept whose building blocks one can customize for the domain of choice, 2) an “agile modeling method engineering” framework that helps one quickly prototype modeling tools, 3) a model-aware “digital product design lab”, and 4) dissemination channels for reaching a global community. In this paper, we demonstrate and evaluate the OMiLAB in research with two selected application cases for domain- and case-specific requirements. Besides these exemplary cases, OMiLAB has proven to effectively satisfy requirements that almost 50 modeling methods raise and, thus, to support researchers in designing novel modeling methods, developing tools, and disseminating outcomes.

The concept of the sustainable business model describes the rationale of how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value, in economic, social, cultural, or other contexts, in a sustainable way. The process of sustainable business model construction forms an innovative part of a business strategy. Different industries and businesses have utilized sustainable business models' concept to satisfy their economic, environmental, and social goals simultaneously.

Designing a tool or methodology that will capture the impact of collaborative research and innovation projects related to sustainability requires input from technical experts but also from experts in the domains of survey design and communication.

This paper proposes six key recommendations that should be considered for those monitoring projects when identifying metrics and designing a sustainability impact report. These recommendations stem from a series of in-depth interviews about sustainability and innovation impact reporting with research project co-ordinators in the process industries (e.g., cement, ceramics, chemicals, engineering, minerals and ores, non-ferrous metals, steel and water sectors). Our results show that factors such as ambiguous terminology, two-in-one questions, the stage of the project, over-hypothetical estimates, inadequate formats and alternatives and lack of guidelines can negatively influence the data collected in usual project monitoring activities and jeopardise the overall validity of the reporting.

The constantly growing demand for energy has urged researchers to develop highly improved energy storage devices. In relation to relevant energy storage systems, supercapacitor technology has drawn burgeoning interest in recent years owing to its environmentally safe and cost effective advantages. Especially, its high power density (>10 kW/kg), fast charge/discharge characteristics, and excellent cycle stability are highly beneficial in storing renewable energy. Currently, the rapid development of portable electronic devices and the expanding renewable energy systems have paved the way for energy storage systems to play an important role in human society. Many significant breakthroughs for the next-generation supercapacitors have been achieved in terms of material synthesis, device innovations, and multifunctional device designs. Therefore, this paper summarizes the latest progress on new materials and novel device assemblies. First, to fully assess the effect of device assembly on supercapacitor performance, five types of supercapacitor structures and their assembly principles are discussed in detail, including the three-electrode (also known as semi-battery) device, two-electrode supercapacitor, flexible solid-state supercapacitor, fiber supercapacitor, and planar (micro-) supercapacitor. Among them, the three-electrode system and the two-electrode device are still the most widely used types at present. The three-electrode cell is suitable for characterizing electrode materials or investigating the electrochemical storage processes. The structure of a two-electrode system is closer to an actual supercapacitor. Other specially designed cells, which are fabricated with the aim of meeting the requirements of flexible and lightweight energy sources, have also been proposed in recent years. The results indicate that the structural innovative design could provide a fascinating way to enhance the energy density of devices while also holding huge potential to enhance the compatibility between supercapacitor component and various portable or wearable electronic devices. A careful interpretation and rigorous scrutiny of the electrochemical characteristics of every supercapacitor is also conducted in this work. Moreover, the design principles for enhancing the supercapacitor performance are highlighted through a comprehensive analysis of the literature. The main challenges in the structural innovations for enhancing the electrochemical performance are analyzed. The solutions to overcome these challenges are proposed. Second, supercapacitors still suffer from a lower energy density compared with Li-ion batteries. Among various efforts to build high-performance supercapacitors in recent years, major improvements have been made in electrode materials with rational designs. This review article also examines the latest methodologies and performance evaluation metrics for several emerging electrode materials in terms of their improved electrochemical properties, including carbon materials, binary transition metal oxides (NiCo2O4, Ni3V2O8, and Co3V2O8, among others), transition metal chalcogenides/selenide/phosphide positive electrodes, and VN, Fe2O3 negative electrode materials. This paper also highlights the electrode material design principle, which is the fundamental understanding of the relationships between structural design, structural properties and components of electrode materials and their electrochemical performances. Moreover, we also summarized the latest contributions and progress in multifunctional supercapacitors, which include the transparent flexible supercapacitor, self-healable supercapacitor, piezoelectric supercapacitors, self-charging supercapacitors, and so on. Several methods to realize the abilities of transparent, folded, wearable, self-healable, and even self-chargeable supercapacitors with almost no performance degradation are discussed. This paper also analyzes the compatibility of a multifunctional supercapacitor with industrial manufacturing, and offers a paradigm for developing portable and wearable energy storage devices and systems. Furthermore, the operating principles, system design/engineering, and the rational optimization of the multifunctional supercapacitors are also analyzed in this review. Finally, the major challenges faced by next-generation supercapacitors, along with the future research prospects, are discussed at the end of the paper.', authkeywords='Device structures | Electrode materials | Multifunctional supercapacitors | Supercapacitors', citedby_count=13, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfree2read', freetoreadLabel='Bronze', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85063081450', doi='10.1080/24725854.2018.1555383', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='The internet of things for smart manufacturing: A review', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Yang H.', afid='60148980;60147936;60008592', affilname='College of Engineering;Penn State College of Engineering;Hong Kong University of Science and Technology', affiliation_city='College Station;University Park;Hong Kong', affiliation_country='United States;United States;Hong Kong', author_count='4', author_names='Yang, Hui;Kumara, Soundar;Bukkapatnam, Satish T.S.;Tsung, Fugee', author_ids='55197329400;7006663904;6701859346;7003719356', author_afids='60147936;60147936;60148980;60008592', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2019', publicationName='IISE Transactions', issn='24725854', source_id='21100794597', eIssn='24725862', aggregationType='Journal', volume='51', issueIdentifier='11', article_number=None, pageRange='1190-1216', description='The modern manufacturing industry is investing in new technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, cloud computing and cybersecurity to cope with system complexity, increase information visibility, improve production performance, and gain competitive advantages in the global market. These advances are rapidly enabling a new generation of smart manufacturing, i.e., a cyber-physical system tightly integrating manufacturing enterprises in the physical world with virtual enterprises in cyberspace. To a great extent, realizing the full potential of cyber-physical systems depends on the development of new methodologies on the Internet of Manufacturing Things (IoMT) for data-enabled engineering innovations. This article presents a review of the IoT technologies and systems that are the drivers and foundations of data-driven innovations in smart manufacturing. We discuss the evolution of internet from computer networks to human networks to the latest era of smart and connected networks of manufacturing things (e.g., materials, sensors, equipment, people, products, and supply chain). In addition, we present a new framework that leverages IoMT and cloud computing to develop a virtual machine network. We further extend our review to IoMT cybersecurity issues that are of paramount importance to businesses and operations, as well as IoT and smart manufacturing policies that are laid out by governments around the world for the future of smart factory.

According to the author’s opinion this participation may be much bigger [4-27]. All the needed components to participate – human, material and infrastructural are there [4,7]. So why the results are not satisfying as they should be? The major research subjects of ARIES are: new methods of particles acceleration including laser, plasma and particle beam interactions, new materials and accelerator components, building new generations of accelerators, energy efficiency and management of large accelerator systems, innovative superconducting magnets, high field and ultra-high gradient magnets, cost lowering, system miniaturization, promotion of innovation originating from accelerator research, industrial applications, and societal implications. Two institutions from Poland participate in ARIES – these are Warsaw University of Technology and Institute of Nuclear Chemistry and Technology in Warsaw. There are not present some of the key institutes active in accelerator technology in Poland. Let this article be a small contribution why Poland, a country of such big research potential, contributes so modestly to the European accelerator infrastructural projects?

Changes in land–water strategies are often required, as ‘business-as-usual’ solutions are no longer sufficient. The aim of this paper was to study tidal river management (TRM) as a strategic innovation, and trace how it is appreciated by people and used in master plans to address congested rivers and waterlogging in Bangladesh. In this context, a strategic innovation can be categorised as having four features: (i) it is a fundamental reconceptualisation of business as usual strategies; (ii) it is rule breaking and reshapes markets; (iii) it offers value improvement for livelihoods; (iv) it is sustainable. The case study analysis was built from 17 interviews, a focus group discussion and numerous documents. The case analysis revealed that tidal river management is very different (local, natural, complex) from mainstream engineering strategies for tidal rivers and polder systems, and is strongly supported by local people for its potential livelihood improvement. The paper concludes that tidal river management has strategic potential, though is hardly recognised in master plans. To advance practice, reconceptualisations are needed that focus on the diverse benefits of TRM, such as restored tidal rivers, flora and fauna. Further research could elaborate livelihood models that thrive on these benefits, and evaluate their costs and benefits accordingly.', authkeywords='Delta management | Grassroots | Innovation | Planning | Silt | Strategic thinking | Transition', citedby_count=16, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfree2read', freetoreadLabel='Bronze', fund_acr='NWO', fund_no='W 07.69.106', fund_sponsor='Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85062657597', doi='10.1007/978-3-030-12957-6_1', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='The Project of the Rehabilitation of Holy Sepulchre’s Holy Aedicule as a Pilot Multispectral, Multidimensional, Novel Approach Through Transdisciplinarity and Cooperation in the Protection of Monuments', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Moropoulou A.', afid='60002947', affilname='National Technical University of Athens (NTUA)', affiliation_city='Athens', affiliation_country='Greece', author_count='7', author_names='Moropoulou, Antonia;Korres, Manolis;Georgopoulos, Andreas;Spyrakos, Constantine;Mouzakis, Charalambos;Lampropoulos, Kyriakos C.;Apostolopoulou, Maria', author_ids='7005901969;57195396139;8053177000;35607727800;56111313500;56868465700;57200629031', author_afids='60002947;60002947;60002947;60002947;60002947;60002947;60002947', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2019', publicationName='Communications in Computer and Information Science', issn='18650929', source_id='17700155007', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Book Series', volume='961', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='3-25', description='The Holy Aedicule of the Holy Sepulchre, an emblematic monument that has survived throughout the centuries, recently underwent a major and demanding rehabilitation under the responsibility of the National Technical University of Athens Interdisciplinary Team.

Further the paper will try to outline the digital infrastructures’ communication abilities in sharing knowledge, connecting them to main questions about preserving and promoting landscape and scattered heritage, again keeping in the background the European policies, mostly about digitalization. As regards the relationship between landscapes and heritage, it will be paid specific attention both on the called “Top-down” actions and on knowing and giving values from below, from “Bottom-up” practices. In fact, the two strategies are complementary, because the first—Presentation—regards the careful goal of informing and making heritage available in a way normally carried out by scholars, professionals and more in general experts in the heritage field. The second strategy, better known as Interpretation, refers on the other hand, to research and creativity activities and results generated in a heritage site. In such perspective, involving visitors as well local people and communities is crucial for interpreting and changing sites as cultural landscapes, into places where legacies of the past can turn to a resource for the future.

The authors apply the sociotechnical view of technology and the ramifications this view has on successful use of technology in design and construction. Design/methodology/approach: This is a discussion paper reviewing over a decade of research that connects three streams of research on architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) teams as these teams grappled with adapting work practices to new technologies and the opportunities these technologies promised. Findings: From studies of design and construction practices with building information modeling and energy modeling, the authors show that given the constructed nature of models and the loose coupling of project teams, these team organizational practices need to mirror the modeling requirements. Second, looking at distributed teams, whose interaction is mediated by technology, the authors argue that virtual world visualizations enhance discovery, while distributed AEC teams also need more traditional forms of 2D abstraction, sketching and gestures to support integrated design dialogue. Finally, in information exchange research, the authors found that models and data have their own logic and structure and, as such, require creativity and ingenuity to exchange data across systems.

Agriculture sector is facing challenges to get integrated with the business sector and to getting timely and convenient information to increase the productivity. Agricultural mechanization helps to overcome this problem. Agri Engineering Manufacturing Companies (AEMC) plays a major role in effective implementation of Agricultural mechanization. Agricultural mechanization has been accepted as an important element of modernization of agriculture by the world. Hence this article focused on the ways to address the contemporary issues for sustainability of AEMC. In this article quantitative research has been carried out and a thorough literature review has been carried out through scholarly Scopus Indexed journals to identify the factors for sustainability of AEMC for the purpose of conducting pilot study. The critical factors such as Entrepreneurial Competency (EC), Business Model (BM), Innovation and Technology (IT) were arrived based on the rating and ranking scale calculation. Survey questionnaire was developed and validated based on the feedback given by the entrepreneurs, academicians, subject experts and industry experts. A total population of 372 numbers of AEMC has been identified through agricultural department websites, trade websites and agricultural events in the state of Karnataka. Census method of sampling has been adopted and the sample was categorised based on their manufacturing activity such as Equipment and implements, Irrigation, Farm Machineries and Processing Machineries. The primary data has been collected through face to face interview, telephonic interview and Google spreadsheet. The collected data has been analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 25 (SPSS 25) and Analysis of Moment Structures 25 (AMOS 25) software. The data reliability and validity has been analysed through Cronbach alpha value of 0.785 and KMO value of 0.703 respectively which are well within the limit. Further Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) has been used to develop a model consisting of the identified factors such as EC, BM and IT. The obtained Goodness of fit statistics values are well within the acceptable limit. The output of this research is recommended to implement in AEMC such as farm equipment, machineries and irrigation equipment manufacturing companies.

Because of the advancement in the technology and innovation in the materials area, the composite materials are replacing and occupying the traditional materials market rapidly. Among these composite materials, the Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composite materials are found to be technically and structurally competitive and are widely used in a number of engineering industrial applications. The machining of these composites is found to be a complex phenomenon due to the influence of a number of machining and material parameters related to machining. Since drilling is the most frequently applied machining operation on composites, many research works were done on the drilling of composites, which resulted in numerous parameters that have influence on the drilling operation, impact on work material and cutting tool damage, cost of machining, material removal rate etc. So, at the background, it was thought to have a review on the issues related to drilling on the composite materials, which could help the manufacturing sectors and researchers in order to enhance the productivity.

This calls for high-productive and ecology-friendly technologies for more efficient mineral beneficiation based on intensification of operating and new methods to extract valuable components from rebellious ore and technogenic minerals, relying on the last achievements of basic sciences, combination of dressing and chemico-metallurgical processes and using advanced pyro- and hydrometallurgical technologies. The transition to a new strategy of processing is only possible based on the new technological-mineralogical appraisal of a mineral raw material. Actually, the process mineralogy has a stock of modern high-resolution physical methods for analyzing composition, structure and properties of geomaterials, inclusive of micro- and nano-levels: - Identification of micro- and nano-size noble metals, and natural and induced formations on mineral surface; - Experimental validation of structural phase and chemical transformation of minerals under different energy input; - Justification of choice and mechanism of interaction between flotation agents and noble metals with complex material constitution; - Analysis of structural, phase and chemical transformations of sulfides and rocks under leaching. Thus, process mineralogy is an informational background for a unified theoretical approach to scientific justification of flowsheets of efficient mineral processing. The article gives a brief review of practices that have found application and proved to be of high economic efficiency. Such practices are: X-ray radiometry and photometry separation (Uchalinsky and Gaisky Mining and Processing Integrated Works of ALROSA); selective disintegration (equipment engineered by Mekhanobr-Tekhnika and IPKON RAS); process selectivity enhancement (IPKON RAS, Central Research Institute for Geological Exploration of Nonferrous and Noble Metals, Chinakal Institute of Mining, Siberian Branch RAS, etc.); bacterial gold leaching (Olimpiada MPIW, technologies developed the Central Research Institute for Geological Exploration of Nonferrous and Noble Metals, Nezhdaninsky deposit projects, etc.); combination processing at a mining and metallurgy plant (Norilsk Mining and Metallurgical Company, Yaregsky deposit projects and others); processing of waste: overburden, mill tailings, slag, etc. (Kovdorsky MPIW, Svyatogor JSC, Ural Mining and Metallurgical Company, plants designed by the Central Research Institute for Geological Exploration of Nonferrous and Noble Metals, Mining Institute of Kola Science Center RAS, Research Institute for Chemical Technologies); water conditioning in mineral dressing circuits (ALROSA, equipment by IPKON, etc.); utilization of process water (ALROSA, Ural Mining and Metallurgical Company, Severalmaz JSC and others).

New theories and technologies are also key factors affecting the design and development trends of service models and solutions. Major automobile manufacturers aspire to provide customers with unique services and experiences, resulting in a growing demand for systematic approaches to characterize customer behaviors and scientific methods to accurately interpret data stored in databases. This study proposes a scientific engineering and operation framework for driving services that enables conventional automobile manufacturers to re-evaluate their service models and solutions as they expand into the domain of autonomous driving, integrating customized consumer interactions and mass production efficiency to develop new technologies, and subsequently applying these technologies to innovate their driving services, form service innovation guidelines, and accelerate the development of smart applications for the automobile industry. A Kano two-dimensional model of quality was employed. A Kano questionnaire was administered to analyze consumers' perceived satisfaction concerning different service quality elements; the elements were then ranked in the order of requiring improvement to determine the elements that are essential in conventional vehicles. Finally, suggestions were proposed for improving the service quality of driving products and evaluating driver satisfaction. A total of 56 valid questionnaires were collected from potential buyers of four-door sedans. The questionnaire evaluated respondents’ perceived value and satisfaction of 30 product elements categorized into two groups (specific functions and intangible value-added services) across eight major quality dimensions (basic safety functions, multimedia entertainment systems, information and communication systems, value-added systems, active matching, automatic service systems, hardware–software integration, and customer service and support). In addition, Kano quality categories were statistically analyzed to elucidate whether significant differences existed between groups. Using the Kano quality categories, 30 design elements were classified: 10 as “attractive,” 7 as “one-dimensional,” 3 as “must-be,” 4 as “indifferent,” and 6 as “reverse.” Enterprises can effectively reduce customer dissatisfaction and enhance customer satisfaction based on the quality category of the product and the product improvement order proposed in this study.

One of the distinguishing features of the R&D globalization phenomenon is its concentration within the software/ information technology (IT) domain. The increase in foreign R&D on the firm side has been largely concentrated within software and IT-intensive multinational corporations (MNCs). This concentration is mirrored on the country side; new R&D destinations such as India, China, and Israel look very different in the types of innovative activity being done there than older R&D destinations such as Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Japan. In this paper we will document three important phenomena: (1) the globalization of R&D by US MNCs, (2) the growing importance of software and IT to firm innovation, and (3) the rise of new R&D hubs and the differences in the type of activity done there. We argue that the shortage in software/IT- related human capital resulting from the large IT- and software-biased shift in innovation drove US MNCs abroad, and particularly drove them abroad to “new hubs” with large quantities of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workers who possessed IT and software skills. Our findings support the view that the globalization of US multinational R&D has reinforced the technological leadership of US- based firms in the information technology domain and that multinationals’ ability to access an increasingly global talent base could support a high rate of innovation even in the presence of the rising (human) resource cost of frontier R&D.', authkeywords=None, citedby_count=27, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='NSF', fund_no='1360165', fund_sponsor='National Science Foundation'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85055870953', doi='10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.10.005', pii='S0306261918315587', pubmed_id=None, title='Energy justice in the transition to low carbon energy systems: Exploring key themes in interdisciplinary research', subtype='ed', subtypeDescription='Editorial', creator='McCauley D.', afid='60171149;60118783;60118751;60029616;60022132;60008877;60001565', affilname='University of Sussex Business School;Lund University Centre for Sustainability Studies;The International Institute for Industrial Environmental Economics;Aarhus Universitet;University of St Andrews;University of Dundee;Stellenbosch University', affiliation_city='Brighton;Lund;Lund;Aarhus;St Andrews;Dundee;Stellenbosch', affiliation_country='United Kingdom;Sweden;Sweden;Denmark;United Kingdom;United Kingdom;South Africa', author_count='6', author_names='McCauley, Darren;Ramasar, Vasna;Heffron, Raphael J.;Sovacool, Benjamin K.;Mebratu, Desta;Mundaca, Luis', author_ids='35820993300;14020331200;54895383200;9333655700;14627675800;8633490700', author_afids='60022132;60118783;60008877;60171149-60029616;60001565;60118751', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='1 January 2019', publicationName='Applied Energy', issn='03062619', source_id='28801', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='233-234', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='916-921', description='With the dual challenges of reducing emissions from fossil fuels and providing access to clean and affordable energy, there is an imperative for a transition to a low carbon energy system.

Common causes of amputation include congenital deformities, vascular diseases, diabetes, and accidents. A prosthesis is an assistive device that is used to substitute and restore the normal functions of the missing part of body. A prosthesis can be either functional or cosmetic, and can be either attached to the body externally or implanted surgically. Without prosthetic innovations, lower-limb amputees are required to have ordinary ambulatory skills sufficient to perform the basic movement functions and the ability to stand, walk, sit, reach with hands and arms, and manipulate (lift, carry, move) light to medium weights. Unfortunately, some amputees are unable even to stand and use their prosthesis to meet their demand. It has been found that traditional prostheses are mostly passive products with limitations and drawbacks. Recent research suggests that a trend in the utilization of active actuators/prostheses can overcome limitations and drawbacks of passive prostheses. Major functions of active prostheses are real-time intent recognitions, control strategies, torque requirements reduction, and energy saving. This paper presents the design of robotic skeletal system of the lower limb for computerized prosthetic leg development. The major structure of robotic skeletal systems consists of lower-limb joints modules, kinematics sensors and kinetics sensors. By taking advantage of the modern microprocessor-based controllers and low-power transmitters, the new robotic skeleton systems are created with better control performance in nearly real-time basis, lighter weight, higher flexibility, greater range of movement around a join, and better safety. The preliminary experiments are performed to evaluate the new design of robotic skeletal system by measuring sensors data while walking on ground, and climbing up-down stairs. Findings indicate the new design of a robotic skeletal system can provide the useful biomechanics parameters, which can be used for the development of computerized lower limb prosthesis.', authkeywords='Computerized lower limb prosthesis | Robotic skeleton systems', citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='KMUTNB', fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=\"King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok\"), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85049537136', doi='10.1007/978-3-319-94947-5_38', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Research on interactive innovation design of barrier-free products for visually impaired groups', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Xie Z.', afid='60014070', affilname='Hunan Normal University', affiliation_city='Changsha', affiliation_country='China', author_count='1', author_names='Xie, Zijie', author_ids='57202835914', author_afids='60014070', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2019', publicationName='Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing', issn='21945357', source_id='5100152904', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Book Series', volume='794', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='381-389', description='According to the characteristics and needs of the visually impaired, an innovative design method for visually impaired groups with barrier-free products under the guidance of modern interactive design concepts is proposed to address barriers and problems when interacting with the products, and to create interactive products for visually impaired people with barrier-free products.

DHD is characterized by dislocation of the femoral head in the acetabulum. In Brazil are diagnosed three times more cases than the world average (5–8 cases for 1,000 births). The lack of treatment leads to long-term morbidity, abnormal gait, chronic pain and arthritis. Early detection and treatment with a Pavlik harness results in improved outcomes. After 6 months of age, closed or open reduction with spica casting is required for 4 months to treat a persistent hip dislocation. Plaster is used for orthopedic immobilization due the low cost, moldability and good mechanical resistance. However, there are several risks and complications due to the use of spica cast in DHD treatment: Skin problems due to lack of adequate hygiene (itching, ulceration, dermatitis and infection), formation of pressure areas, plaster fracture (11% of cases) and fever. Digitization techniques have been explored for production of customized hip abduction brace by additive manufacturing. However, it is not possible to keep a child standing still to perform 3D scanning of the hip and legs region.

Following this trend, over the past years we have seen an increase in the number of studies reporting the monitoring of the cardinal signs (e.g., tremor, stiffness and bradykinesia) of Parkinson’s disease (PD) during prolonged activities for hours or days. A major challenge in the area is to monitor the progress of the disorder objectively so that treatments can be customized. In addition, patients suffer from the lack of predictive information regarding their health condition in the future. In this context, customized systems, i.e., database, that can group information from the motor symptoms of PD are of paramount relevance. By using such systems, one can track the progress of the disorder and more importantly can use data mining for seeking hidden patterns in the data. To contribute for the organization and management of information obtained from patients with PD this research proposed the architecture and organization of a multiplatform system with customized user control, modules and permissions to manipulate information on each screen. This system has three modules, being the first for storing and organizing information from data collection with distinct types of data; the second for the management of information from the application of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS); and the third for promoting technological innovation in the area. These three modules in a single system can be part of the clinical routine of hospitals and research centers dedicated to the understanding, treatment and research in PD.', authkeywords='Biomedical data | Computational system | Parkinson’s disease', citedby_count=1, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='CAPES', fund_no='305223/2014-3', fund_sponsor='Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85045457749', doi='10.1177/0954406217753236', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Facilitating creativity in interdisciplinary design teams using cognitive processes: A review', subtype='re', subtypeDescription='Review', creator='Reiter-Palmon R.', afid='60018988', affilname='University of Nebraska Omaha', affiliation_city='Omaha', affiliation_country='United States', author_count='2', author_names='Reiter-Palmon, Roni;Leone, Salvatore', author_ids='6603292731;57197016761', author_afids='60018988;60018988', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='1 January 2019', publicationName='Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part C: Journal of Mechanical Engineering Science', issn='09544062', source_id='20407', eIssn='20412983', aggregationType='Journal', volume='233', issueIdentifier='2', article_number=None, pageRange='385-394', description='Interdisciplinary, or cross-functional, teams have become quite common for engineering and design. Many of today’s scientific breakthroughs occur in interdisciplinary teams, as the increasingly complex problems facing society often cannot be addressed by single disciplines alone. However, fostering creative and productive collaboration in interdisciplinary teams is no easy challenge. First, leading creative teamwork is difficult by itself. Second, many of the factors that impede teams and teamwork in general are exacerbated in interdisciplinary teams as a result of differences between team members. In this paper, we will review the team creativity psychology and management literature, and discuss how cognitive processes that facilitate creativity can be used by engineering and design teams. Specifically, past research has shown problem construction that allows teams to develop a structure to guide solving ambiguous problems. Further, problem construction allows teams to develop a shared understanding of the problem which aids in later processes. While there is significant research on idea generation, results suggest that teams may not be better at this than individuals. In this review, we discuss how idea generation in teams can mitigate some of the issues that lead to this effect. Finally, team research has only recently began to determine what factors influence idea evaluation and selection for implementation.', authkeywords='creative problem solving | creativity | design | engineering | innovation | interaction | interdisciplinary teams | Review | teams', citedby_count=25, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85045431133', doi='10.1177/0954406218758795', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Instructor approaches to creativity in engineering design education', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Tekmen-Araci Y.', afid='60030804', affilname='Swinburne University of Technology', affiliation_city='Hawthorn', affiliation_country='Australia', author_count='2', author_names='Tekmen-Araci, Yasemin;Mann, Llewellyn', author_ids='57201634461;23094891300', author_afids='60030804;60030804', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='1 January 2019', publicationName='Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part C: Journal of Mechanical Engineering Science', issn='09544062', source_id='20407', eIssn='20412983', aggregationType='Journal', volume='233', issueIdentifier='2', article_number=None, pageRange='395-402', description=\"Creativity is essential in the engineering design process. Researchers, academics, educators, and engineering organisations all agree that further improvement is necessary in training methods for fostering creativity in engineering education. Even though studies exist about how creativity should be taught in engineering education, there is still limited research about the challenges of practical implementation. To address this gap, an action research project has been conducted in two undergraduate Mechanical Engineering design subjects at a prominent university in Australia with the aim of enhancing creativity during the problem-solving process. The study shows the many challenges that arose when enhancing creativity in engineering design education, and the issues that surrounded this implementation. Although teaching creativity to engineering students is a challenge, this study illuminates the difficulties of convincing the engineering instructors to embed creativity in the subjects they teach. Overall, the study found that instructors' understandings and beliefs about creativity influence their teaching approach and what they value. These influences were around four main areas: the instructors' focus on the design product being produced, their educational backgrounds and training, the subjective nature of creativity and their beliefs about it, and the performance mindset of the instructors. These findings suggest that enhancing creativity among engineering students is not possible until the engineering educators and practitioners understand and value creativity practice.\", authkeywords='Creativity | engineering design | engineering education | innovation | instructor approach', citedby_count=22, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85045425037', doi='10.1177/0954406218763449', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Leading creative research and development efforts: A literature review and proposed framework for the engineering domain', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Mumford M.', afid='60030931', affilname='The University of Oklahoma', affiliation_city='Norman', affiliation_country='United States', author_count='2', author_names='Mumford, Michael D.;Mulhearn, Tyler J.', author_ids='7004956470;56597940300', author_afids='60030931;60030931', coverDate='2019-01-01', coverDisplayDate='1 January 2019', publicationName='Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part C: Journal of Mechanical Engineering Science', issn='09544062', source_id='20407', eIssn='20412983', aggregationType='Journal', volume='233', issueIdentifier='2', article_number=None, pageRange='403-414', description='We commonly assume that leadership is not critical to the success of creative efforts.

In this paper, we report our work in the SciChallenge European project, which aims at increasing the interest of pre-university students in STEM disciplines, through its distinguishing feature, the systematic use of social media for providing and evaluation of the student-generated content. A social media-aware contest and platform were thus developed and tested in a pan-European contest that attracted > 700 participants.
