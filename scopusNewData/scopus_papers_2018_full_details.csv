The bioeconomy of waste-to-energy production,"This chapter concerns the biobased materials for chemicals and approaches the energy markets, which remain as a reference of the global sustainable resources. There is a plethora of raw materials and industrial processes that can be used as biobased substances, including agricultural residues, straws, wood, and urban garbage, which may be semantically classified as "" waste."" The latter is the surplus material for the co-production of valuable and sustainable biofuels, chemical compounds, electricity and heat. The use of waste as biobased material can prevent the hazardous effects to the environment that result from food cultivation for biofuels production. To understand the global efforts on knowledge production and their relations with the research and development (R&D) in this bioeconomy field, this chapter presents a Science, Technology and Innovation map of biobased "" waste"" materials. In addition, the R&D dynamics of an enterprise is analyzed. Two methodological approaches are integrated: the scientometric analysis of the global scientific production as well as the innovation scenarios for "" waste,"" and the patent citation networks by technological categories, because this is a thorough economic indicator of R&D efforts. Results show an enormous but technologically immature pattern of investments in the last decade, changing from chemical to biological technical bases. Considering the industrial and engineering processes and the demands for technological development on those materials, four enterprises seem to have an integrated group of technologies considering a reasonable potential for future "" waste markets."" In this context, the conclusions in this study may support R&D policies and entrepreneurial investments, especially by the identification of emerging areas and allocation of knowledge resources for industrial sustainable development.",Dal-Poz M.,Book,Waste-to-Energy (WtE),2018-12-28,Universidade Estadual de Campinas,Bioeconomy ;  Innovation ;  Networks ;  Patent indicators ;  Scientometrics ;  Sustainable materials

Educational innovations in Engineering education: Sustainability of funded projects developed in Portuguese higher education institutions,"The importance of promoting educational innovations in higher education has been highlighted by the research community (e.g. educational researchers) and also by the academic community (e.g. university teachers). Educational innovations could be educational resources and/or teaching, learning and assessment strategies for the purpose of improving teachers' academic practices and/or students' learning achievements. This paper presents a study focused on the sustainability of educational innovations developed in engineering courses, with a particular emphasis on the teachers' role. These innovations were developed by educational researchers and/or engineering teachers of public Portuguese Higher Education Institutions (universities and institutes) in the scope of financed projects. A collective case study was carried out in order to characterize projects supported by national research funding agencies, between 2006 and 2013. Document analysis of the projects' materials (e.g. scientific reports) was carried out and interviews with coordinators of selected projects were conducted. These aimed to determine the extent to which these projects have considered the impact and sustainability of educational innovations, since their conception. The sustainability involved at least part of its implementation, modification and/or expansion of the educational innovations in other contexts (e.g. other Engineering courses) by participants of the project (e.g. university teachers). Results showed that some of the developed educational innovations were sustained after the end of the funding, but that this issue should be analyzed further. Guidelines are proposed herein to enhance the sustainability of educational innovations developed in higher education following the conclusion of projects, in order to provide more information to educational policies, funding agencies and involved actors (e.g. teachers).",Guerra C.; Costa N.,Conference Proceeding,"3rd International Conference of the Portuguese Society for Engineering Education, CISPEE 2018",2018-12-27,Centro de Investigação Didática e Tecnologia na Formação de Formadores (CIDTFF),Educational innovations ;  Engineering Education ;  Portuguese higher education institutions ;  Sustainability of funded research

Optimized methodology using multi-choice question tests on paper from question authoring to grade publishing,"The introduction of the FCT Curricular Profile at Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, a pioneering pedagogical model in Portugal, allowed to accommodate transversal skills, such as research and entrepreneurialism, soft skills and contact with industry in all its BSc, MSc and integrated MSc curricula. Since these skills are increasingly being recognized by employes, the chances for the Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia of Universidade Nova de Lisboa s students to be successful in the job market tend to increase. However, the calendar changes resulting from this pedagogical model imposed serious management problems concerning assessment using on-paper tests, specially to courses with a high number of enrolled students (ranging from 200 to 800).Here we present a methodology that is being used since 2012 that proved to successfully overcome those difficulties. The methodology embraces the whole process of assessment using on-paper tests from its beginning (test authoring) to grades publication. The methodology implementation enabled a significant decrease of faculty s exam/test proctoring time, reduced the grading time for less than an hour, and permitted a much more efficient use of university s rooms dedicated to tests. Moreover, allowed many professors to convey many hours previously spent in related test activities to their research and teaching innovation activities.",Oliveira F.,Conference Proceeding,"3rd International Conference of the Portuguese Society for Engineering Education, CISPEE 2018",2018-12-27,Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade Nova de Lisboa,FCT Curricular Profile ;  FCT NOVA ;  MCQ ;  Multiple-choice question test ;  On-paper test ;  Optimized methodology

Getting to Zero Carbon Emissions in the Electric Power Sector,"We summarize insights from 40 studies, collectively outlining two broad pathways to decarbonize electricity: one relying primarily on wind and solar power with support from storage, demand flexibility, and transmission expansion; and a second harnessing these options alongside “firm” low-carbon resources such as nuclear, geothermal, biomass, and carbon capture and storage. Both routes may be feasible but must overcome several challenges. Improving and expanding the portfolio of available low-carbon resources offers a greater likelihood of affordably achieving deep decarbonization.",Jenkins J.; Luke M.; Thernstrom S.,Journal,Joule,2018-12-19,"National Economic Research Associates, Inc.;John F.

Contextual Knowledge Content Driving for Model of Cyber Physical System,"Essential change of industrial products was their development towards cyber physical system (CPS) during the past decade. Model of these complex multidisciplinary product structures required completing the conventional physical level with system levels. At the same time, higher-level engineering for CPS demanded completing the usual engineering processes by research activities. By now, generic self-adaptive engineering model system can serve all activities during innovation and life cycles of industrial products to fulfill the above new requirements. The Laboratory of Intelligent Engineering Systems at Óbuda University recognized importance of engineering model system for CPS. One of the main research issues at this laboratory is replacing the increasingly complex interactive model entity definition by knowledge drive using reusable knowledge accumulated in intellectual property of a project, a company or an institution. For this purpose, new structure of driving knowledge content was proposed as integrated part of engineering model system. This paper introduces rearranged and redefined content structure to serve system-based engineering model of CPS and driving contexts with cyber units of CPS. Results is placed in the concept of lifecycle cyber physical system of systems (LCPSoS). Multilayer structures are proposed for driving contexts which come from outside of engineering model system.",Horvath L.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 15th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision, ICARCV 2018",2018-12-18,Obuda University,

A Programmed Anti-Inflammatory Nanoscaffold (PAIN) as a 3D Tool to Understand the Brain Injury Response,"Immunology is the next frontier of nano/biomaterial science research, with the immune system determining the degree of tissue repair. However, the complexity of the inflammatory response represents a significant challenge that is essential to understand for the development of future therapies. Cell-instructive 3D culture environments are critical to improve our understanding of the link between the behavior and morphology of inflammatory cells and to remodel their response to injury. This study has taken two recent high-profile innovations—functional peptide-based hydrogels, and the inclusion of anti-inflammatory agents via coassembly—to make a programmed anti-inflammatory nanoscaffold (PAIN) with unusual and valuable properties that allows tissue-independent switching of the inflammatory cascade. Here, extraordinary durability of the anti-inflammatory agent allows, for the first time, the development of a 3D culture system that maintains the growth and cytoskeletal reorganization of brain tissue, while also facilitating the trophic behavior of brain cells for 22 d in vitro. Notably, this behavior was confirmed within an active scar site due to the unprecedented resilience to the presence of inflammatory cells and enzymes in the brain. Efficacy of the culture system is demonstrated via novel insights about inflammatory cell behavior, which would be impossible to obtain via in vivo experimentation.",Maclean F.; Ims G.; Horne M.; Williams R.; Nisbet D.,Journal,Advanced Materials,2018-12-13,University of Melbourne;RMIT University;The Australian National University;St. Vincent's Hospital Melbourne,3D cell culture ;  disease modeling ;  inflammation ;  nanoscaffolds ;  regenerative medicine

"Peer-Led Team Learning in General Chemistry I: Interactions with Identity, Academic Preparation, and a Course-Based Intervention","Robust evidence shows that Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) improves the academic success of first-year college students in introductory Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) courses. Less clear is the extent to which this positive PLTL effect varies across different subgroups of the population. The current study aims to deepen our understanding of the overall PLTL effect by extensively evaluating an optional PLTL program associated with General Chemistry I at a private, research university. Using five years of exam data, this study disaggregates the PLTL effect by demographics (sex and race), academic preparation (math skills, chemistry content knowledge, and experience with college-preparatory coursework), and participation in another curricular innovation (a growth-mindset intervention). Results revealed that the positive effect of PLTL was comparable across demographic identity groups. Thus, the PLTL program benefitted all participants but did not reduce the pre-existing performance disparity between underrepresented minority and white students (no sex-based disparity was observed). In terms of academic preparation, the PLTL effect interacted with students' level of experience with college-preparatory coursework but not with their math or chemistry knowledge. This pattern suggests that PLTL may help develop students' self-management or reasoning skills, without necessarily narrowing knowledge gaps. Finally, PLTL interacted with participation in a growth-mindset intervention: the difference between PLTL participants and nonparticipants was smaller among students who received the mindset intervention. Implications for chemical education researchers and practitioners are discussed, with an eye toward fostering equity in introductory STEM courses.",Frey R.; Fink A.; Cahill M.; McDaniel M.; Solomon E.,Journal,Journal of Chemical Education,2018-12-11,Washington University in St. Louis,Chemical Education Research ;  Collaborative/Cooperative Learning ;  Constructivism ;  First-Year Undergraduate/General

Parlour of food futures:future food forecasting as tarot prophecies,"In contemporary design research and practice, food is often seen as a problem to be fixed. Designers in the corporate startup realm as well as in academic HFI (Human-Food Interaction) have proposed various techno-solutions to curb complex food system issues such as malnutrition and environmental unsustainability. Quantified diet trackers, 'smart' kitchenware, food sharing apps and similar digital food technologies present opportunities for efficient food practices but also challenges to human-food relationship and social food traditions. The Parlour of Futures project reflects on these contradictions and addresses the growing trend of food-technology innovation through the lens of Speculative and Critical Design (SCD). The project takes the form of a traditional Tarot parlour where participants explore possible food-tech futures as prophecies. Through a bespoke Food Tarot cards deck presenting speculative food practices such as Monsanta[n]ism, Gut Gardening, or Turing Foodism, the project provokes playful food-tech imaginaries and future food scenarios.

UAV for Everyone : An Intuitive Control Alternative for Drone Racing Competitions,"As many technological innovations, the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) were created for military purposes. However, these aircrafts are now a reality accessible for common civilians and are used to explore new possibilities in areas like cinema, photography or surveillance. The technology easily reached other application fields and turned into a new sports category as well, supported by many drone racing competitions that happen around the world. There are many alternatives to control a quadcopter, but the most accurate relies on a robust and heavy handheld remote controller that requires dexterity to be a good pilot. This limits the control of the UAV to users comfortable with this kind of interaction, discarding people with reduced fine motor skills, hand malformations or elders with low learning capacity from the possibility of piloting a quadcopter and participate in competition events. An alternative to these remote controllers should be developed to overpass the mentioned disadvantages. The solution proposed in this paper is an intuitive and accurate control system made of two small and lightweight wearable devices capable of detecting patterns based on motion events. These patterns are then sent to a mobile application responsible for controlling the drone. Wearing the described devices like a high-tech glove, the users can pilot the UAV through simple and intuitive upper limb movements, being the changes in the orientation of each device over time identified as a specific pattern.

Research Progress on the Formation Mechanism of Surface Gradient Nano-structure and Its Mechanical Properties,"With the implementation of the national ""One Belt, One Road"" strategic policy, higher requirements have been put forward for the independent innovation of a number of major projects, such as advanced rail transit equipment, marine engineering equipment and so on. These workpieces are subjected to complex mechanical forces and heat during service, and they are susceptible to damage or failure such as (thermal) fatigue and (heat) wear, which always originate from the surface. Therefore, the most effective way to increase the service life of the workpieces is to improve surface quality. In recent years, there have been many studies concentrated on the structural materials with ultra-fine crystalline and nanocrystalline. Due to the existence of a large number of interfaces (such as twin boundaries and grain boundaries), their physicochemical pro-perties are quite different from those of coarse-grained materials. However, the generation of a large number of defects in the grain refining process is unavoidable, so an ultra-fine crystalline and nanocrystalline structural material exhibits high strength but reduced plasticity and toughness. These mentioned defects hinder the applications and development of the ultra-fine crystalline, nanocrystalline structural materials. The latest research indicates that multi-layer construction of structural elements of materials (such as sheet thickness, grain size, etc.) allows the material to exhibit ultra-fine crystalline, nanocrystalline structure with high strength and high hardness while retaining the plasticity and toughness of coarse-grained microstructure. The gradient nano-structure is induced by the gradient sharp deformation method is one of the effective methods to improve the overall performance and service behavior of the material. The gradient nanostructure is a nano-surface with different chemical composition and multi-scale microstructures. The size of their structural unit varies spatially, from nanoscale to macroscopic scale. The continuous gradient structure not only can exhibit superior high-strength and high-plastic matching, but also has good fatigue resistance and wear resistance. And this structure is different from the simple mixing or compounding of dimensional microstructure (such as nano-scale structure, ultra-fine grain structure and micro-scale structure). These excellent properties have solved the strength-plastic ""inversion"" relationship of traditional materials to a certain extent. Therefore, surface gradient nanostructures have attracted increasing attention. In this paper, the surface gradient nanostructures formation mechanism of materials with different stacking fault energy is summarized. The principle of surface mechanical grinding, ultrasonic shock violent deformation and laser shock violent deformation technology to prepare surface gradient nanostructures are also introduced. The domestic and foreign studies as regard to surface gradient nanostructures in recent years, as well as their influences on the strength, plasticity, wear resistance and fatigue properties are reviewed and analyzed. The problems existing in the research of surface gradient nanostructures are proposed. The development direction of surface gradient nanostructures is prospected.",Sun J.; Yang Z.; Wang Y.; Mao X.; Zhao X.,Journal,Cailiao Daobao/Materials Reports,2018-12-01,Nanjing Institute of Technology;211167 China,Gradient nanocrystallization ;  Mechanical properties ;  Severe plastic deformation ;  Stacking fault energy
Bringing User Experience Design to Bear on STEM Education: A Narrative Literature Review,"This narrative review addresses emerging application of user experience (UX) design principles within education contexts, particularly science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education settings. In this review, “UX design” is employed as an umbrella term to describe design philosophies, approaches, and tools that have originated within technology product design-related fields, namely user-centered design and human-computer interaction. UX design implies commitment to user-focused approaches to product development; UX design commonly includes construction and use of specific design tools (e.g., personas, scenarios, and usage models) that synthesize and contextualize product users’ goals, needs, wants, and behaviors in memorable and empathic ways. This review not only explores implementation of UX design tools and frameworks within education settings, but also examines the methods that have used to develop and implement UX design tools from data generated with students and faculty. Findings reveal that, although nascent, current scholarship provides evidence to support use of UX design tools and approaches to promote instructional innovation and the transfer of research to promote institutional change. To advance these purposes, STEM scholarship should focus on providing methodological detail and evidence of assessment of outcomes related to UX implementation. The results further suggest that future work in this area should explore novel approaches for representing UX design tools contextually within STEM settings.",Minichiello A.; Hood J.; Harkness D.,Journal,Journal for STEM Education Research,2018-12-01,Utah State University,Human-computer interaction ;  Persona ;  Research to practice ;  Scenario ;  Usage model ;  User-centered design
Establishing analogy categories for bio-inspired design,"Biological systems have evolved over billions of years and cope with changing conditions through the adaptation of morphology, physiology, or behavior. Learning from these adaptations can inspire engineering innovation. Several bio-inspired design tools and methods prescribe the use of analogies, but lack details for the identification and application of promising analogies. Further, inexperienced designers tend to have a more difficult time recognizing or creating analogies from biological systems. This paper reviews biomimicry literature to establish analogy categories as a tool for knowledge transfer between biology and engineering to aid bio-inspired design that addresses the common issues. Two studies were performed with the analogy categories. A study of commercialized products verifies the set of categories, while a controlled design study demonstrates the utility of the categories. The results of both studies offer valuable information and insights into the complexity of analogical reasoning and transfer, as well as what leads to biological inspiration versus imitation. The influence on bio-inspired design pedagogy is also discussed. The breadth of the analogy categories is sufficient to capture the knowledge transferred from biology to engineering for bio-inspired design. The analogy categories are a design method independent tool and are applicable for professional product design, research, and teaching purposes.",Nagel J.; Schmidt L.; Born W.,Journal,Designs,2018-12-01,A.

E2bmo: Facilitating user interaction with a biomimetic ontology via semantic translation and interface design,"Function is a key central concept to the practice of biomimicry. Many published models of the biomimicry process include steps to identify, understand, and translate function of biological systems. Examples include functional modeling, decomposition, or abstraction with tools specifically designed to facilitate such steps. A functional approach to biomimicry yields a semantic bridge between biology and engineering, enabling practitioners from a variety of backgrounds to more easily communicate and collaborate in a biomimicry design process. Although analysis of function is likely a necessary part of biomimicry design, recent work suggests it is not sufficient without a more systematic understanding of the complex biological context in which a function exists (e.g., scale and trade-offs). Consequently, emerging tools such as ontologies are being developed that attempt to capture the intricacies of biological systems (including functions), such as their complex environmental and behavioral interactions. However, due to the complexity of such tools, they may be under-utilized. Here, we propose a solution through a computer-aided user interface tool which integrates a biomimetic ontology with a thesaurus-based functional approach to biomimicry. Through a proof of concept illustrative case study, we demonstrate how merging existing tools can facilitate the biomimicry process in a systematic and collaborative way, broadening solution discovery. This work offers an approach to making existing tools, specifically the BioMimetic Ontology, more accessible and encompassing of different perspectives via semantic translation and interface design. This provides the user with the opportunity to interface and extract information from both the Engineering-to-Biology Thesaurus and the BioMimetic Ontology in a way that was not possible before. The proposed E2BMO tool not only increases the accessibility of the BioMimetic Ontology, which ultimately aims to streamline engineers’ interaction with the bio-inspired design process, but also provides an option for practitioners to traverse biological knowledge along the way, encouraging greater interdisciplinary collaboration and consideration when conducting biomimicry research.",McInerney S.; Khakipoor B.; Garner A.; Houette T.; Unsworth C.; Rupp A.; Weiner N.; Vincent J.; Nagel J.; Niewiarowski P.,Journal,Designs,2018-12-01,College of Engineering and Polymer Science;The University of Akron;Heriot-Watt University;James Madison University,Biologically inspired design ;  BioMimetic Ontology ;  Biomimetics ;  Biomimicry ;  Engineering-to-Biology Thesaurus ;  Innovation ;  Ontology ;  Simplified Knowledge Organization System
Students' perception of learning experience of risk management for nano-scaled materials,"As nanotechnology becomes increasingly prevalent in society (through workplace processes, consumer goods, and environmental exposures), there is a need to develop training programs to educate people in advanced material terminology, benefits, and adverse effects. Safety when handling nanomaterials is an important factor to sustain the viability of nanotechnology as a whole. Nanotechnology concepts can be communicated to students as its own subject matter or as an enabler in other STEM fields. Research has shown that offering courses in nanotechnology aids in educating and recruiting students into technology-oriented workforce and has the potential to enable innovations in the field for years to come. Here, we present the methods and outcomes of a departmental driven approach to proactively educate undergraduates in risk management of nanomaterials. The development of a 4000-level course called Principles of Risk Management for Nano Scaled Materials was introduced into the Industrial Technology program in 2009. The genesis for the course came from a funded National Science Foundation grant. Instructors performed surveys to ascertain the students' perceptions of course content. Survey results revealed that the majority of the students evaluated the course content as excellent, citing that they acquired new knowledge in STEM fields as the largest measurable outcome.",Fazarro D.; Sayes C.,Journal,"Journal of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering",2018-12-01,University of Texas at Tyler;Baylor University,Nanotechnology ;  Nanotechnology Safety ;  Risk Management

New-material hybrid structures,"The development and application of new structural materials are a major driving force for technological advances in civil engineering. A new structural material is often very strong in some of its properties, but relatively weak in its other properties. Therefore, in the exploitation of a new structural material in civil engineering, it is often necessary to combine it in an optimal manner with other structural materials, including both traditional and new materials, to deliver excellent structural performance. Compared with traditional steel-concrete composite structures, composite structures enabled by new materials (referred to as new-material hybrid structures) are capable of delivering superior structural performance as a result of greater freedom in material choices. Therefore, new-material hybrid structures offer many possibilities for innovations and advances in structural engineering. This paper introduces five innovative forms of new-material hybrid structures developed by the author’s research group and reviews briefly some of the research work conducted on them so far, with a view to illustrating the advantages of new-material hybrid structures to stimulate further development in the area.",Teng J.,Journal,Tumu Gongcheng Xuebao/China Civil Engineering Journal,2018-12-01,Southern University of Science and Technology;The Hong Kong Polytechnic University,Concrete ;  Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites ;  Hybrid structures ;  Innovative structures ;  New materials ;  Steel ;  Timber
Performance improvement in carbon fiber reinforced polymer-based composites,"As the key strategic materials for national security, carbon fibers (CF) and CF reinforced composites must be independently guaranteed. Among them, the amount of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite material accounts for more than 70% of carbon fiber composites. Resin matrix (content over 35 wt%) is one of the two basic materials of CF reinforced polymer composites, which directly determine the service performance and processing of the composites. The Advanced Composites Center (ACC) in Beijing University of Chemical Technology (BUCT) has carried out a series of fundamental and engineering research solve problems about how to prepare domestic high-performance resin matrix for carbon fiber with the aim of meeting the national strategic needs. ACC research team has made great progress in promoting domestic carbon fiber application and the innovation of high-performance domestic CF reinforced polymer composites. Since 2005, ACC research team have developed the resin matrix system and composites which are compatible with Toray T700/T800/T1000 carbon fibers and M40J, M55J high-modulus carbon fibers, and suitable for forming process with wide viscosity range. A series works have been conquered to promote the development of domestic carbon fibers from ""usable"" to ""easy-to-use"". Research results have significantly improved the performance of domestic carbon fiber reinforced composites, optimized the preparation technology, and guaranteed the design and supporting capability of advanced weapons. In this paper, the research achievements and technical breakthroughs on CF reinforced polymer-based composites done by ACC research team in recent 10 years are summarized. The details include: (1) The cross-linking structure simulation of resin molecules used for CF. (2) Prediction of the relationship between molecular structure and properties of resins through molecule simulation method.

Research and Development on Accelerated Bridge Construction Technology,"In order to lessen drawbacks of traditional bridge construction methods, accelerate the speed of bridge construction, reduce maintenance costs of bridges, and enhance the quality and the durability of bridges, the study analyzed the necessity and the development potentials of the accelerated bridge construction(ABC). It also described the basic systems and component divisions of the accelerated bridge construction, the types and developing trend of prefabricated bridge decks, the connections between concrete decks and steel girders. Three major types of the prefabricated bridge girders and material combinations, prestress systems and their major construction technologies of prestressed segmental concrete box girder bridges, and the main cross-sectional types and joint configurations of concrete or composite bridges for medium or short spans were presented. This article also discussed the applicability and the superiority of the precast high-performance concrete decks and the multi-beam composite bridges connected with group studs in the ABC for medium or short spans. The characteristics of integral precast piers recently used in bridges for crossing bays and long rivers in China were also discussed. This study focused on the current theoretical research methods and developments for ABC system, especially for the steel-concrete composite bridges, precast segmental concrete box girder bridges or the steel-concrete box girder bridge, and the precast segmental bridge pier and other bridge types. The problems that include the shear capacity of group studs, the mechanisms of joint connections between concrete decks and group studs, complex behavior analysis of composite beams, lateral load distributions of multi-girder bridges, dynamic influence analysis of the externally prestressed composite bridges, durability and fatigue of composite beams and others were investigated. Some deficiencies in the rapid construction of bridges in China, such as the study and development of ABC design, innovation of construction-bridge system mechanism, and similar issues. were pointed out. The key factors that restrict the development of this field were analyzed. Meanwhile, the development of bridge industrialization, information and ABC technology in China were outlooked. It was proposed that the ABC was a good alternative with great market potentials for many municipal or highway bridges that span from 25 m to 50 m span with limited girder heights or wide widths, including the bridges that are seasonally affected in northern of China.

Long-term survivorship care after cancer treatment - Summary of a 2017 national cancer policy forum workshop,"The National Cancer Policy Forum of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine sponsored a workshop on July 24 and 25, 2017 on Long-Term Survivorship after Cancer Treatment. The workshop brought together diverse stakeholders (patients, advocates, academicians, clinicians, research funders, and policymakers) to review progress and ongoing challenges since the Institute of Medicine (IOM)'s seminal report on the subject of adult cancer survivors published in 2006. This commentary profiles the content of the meeting sessions and concludes with recommendations that stem from the workshop discussions. Although there has been progress over the past decade, many of the recommendations from the 2006 report have not been fully implemented. Obstacles related to the routine delivery of standardized physical and psychosocial care services to cancer survivors are substantial, with important gaps in care for patients and caregivers. Innovative care models for cancer survivors have emerged, and changes in accreditation requirements such as the Commission on Cancer's (CoC) requirement for survivorship care planning have put cancer survivorship on the radar. The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation's Oncology Care Model (OCM), which requires psychosocial services and the creation of survivorship care plans for its beneficiary participants, has placed increased emphasis on this service. The OCM, in conjunction with the CoC requirement, is encouraging electronic health record vendors to incorporate survivorship care planning functionality into updated versions of their products. As new models of care emerge, coordination and communication among survivors and their clinicians will be required to implement patient- and community-centered strategies.",Kline R.; Arora N.; Bradley C.; Brauer E.; Graves D.; Lunsford N.; McCabe M.; Nasso S.; Nekhlyudov L.; Rowland J.; Schear R.; Ganz P.,Journal,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,2018-12-01,Dell Medical School;Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;National Cancer Institute (NCI);University of Colorado Denver;David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA;Harvard Medical School;Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute;Independent Consultant in Survivorship and Medical Ethics;Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation;National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship,

"A unified BIM adoption taxonomy: Conceptual development, empirical validation and application","Building Information Modelling (BIM) is an innovation that is transforming practices within the Architectural, Engineering, Construction and Operation (AECO) sectors. Many studies have investigated the process of BIM adoption and diffusion and in particular, the drivers affecting adoption at different levels, ranging from individual and team through organisations and supply chains to whole market level. However, in-depth investigations of the stages of the BIM adoption process and the drivers, factors and determinants affecting such stages are still lacking. A comprehensive classification and integration of adoption drivers and factors is absent as these are disjointedly identified across disparate studies. There is also limited attention to the key terms and concepts (i.e. readiness, implementation, diffusion, adoption) in this area of study. This aim in this paper is twofold: (1) to develop and validate a Unified BIM Adoption Taxonomy (UBAT); and (2) to identify the taxonomy's constructs (i.e. three driver clusters and their 17 factors) that have influence on the first three stages of the BIM adoption process namely, awareness, interest, and decision stages, and compare their effects on each of the stages. The research uses: a systematic literature review and knowledge synthesisation to develop the taxonomy; a confirmatory factor analysis for its validation; and an ordinal logistic regression to test the effect of the UBAT's constructs on the BIM adoption process within the UK Architectural sector using a sample of 177 organisations. The paper is primarily intended to enhance the reader's understanding of the BIM adoption process and the constructs that influence its stages. The taxonomy and its sets of drivers and determinants can be used to perform various analyses of the BIM adoption process, delivering evidence and insights for decision makers within organisations and across whole market when formulating BIM diffusion strategies.",Ahmed A.; Kassem M.,Journal,Automation in Construction,2018-12-01,University of Technology- Iraq;University of Northumbria;The University of Sheffield,BIM adoption ;  BIM adoption taxonomy ;  BIM diffusion ;  Innovation diffusion theory ;  Institutional theory ;  Technology acceptance model
Access to Medicines and Performance of the Indian Pharmaceutical Industry: Examining India’s Experience in the New Patent Regime<sup>1</sup>,"The advocates of intellectual property rights project strong patent regime as an effective way to promote research and development (R&D) activities leading to innovation while others argue that they may adversely affect local industries in developing countries and result in monopoly pricing that may compromise on larger interests including public healthcare.

As the country reintroduced product patent protection in 2005, Indian ‘copycats’ could not follow their reverse engineering technology anymore. Being a developing country and ‘pharmacy of the Global South’, India’s experience offers global dimensions to these debates.

Developing a tool to assess responsibility in health innovation: Results from an international delphi study,"Objectives: The way new health technologies are being developed and brought to market undermines the sustainability of health systems around the world and limits the emergence of innovations that could generate greater system-level benefits. While Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) offers relevant principles to address this policy problem, there are no tools to assess whether an innovation qualifies as a Responsible Innovation in Health (RIH). Drawing on RRI and health policy research, we developed a RIH Tool that entails a three-step process: screening, assessment and rating. Methods: To critically evaluate and improve the constructs of the Tool, we conducted an international Delphi study with experts (n = 19) in RRl, biomedical engineering, bioethics and Health Technology Assessment who were asked to examine: (1) the inclusion and exclusion criteria that should be used to identify whether an innovation may potentially qualify as a RIH (screening); (2) the responsibility dimensions and attributes that should be measured in more detail (assessment); and (3) the scoring system that should be applied (rating). Results: A large number of insightful comments was shared by experts (221 comments in Round 1; 69 in Round 2) and, after the second round, consensus was achieved for 16 of the 20 survey questions pertaining to the importance, clarity and appropriateness of the constructs.

Manufacturing Better Outcomes in Cardiovascular Intervention: 3D Printing in Clinical Practice Today,"Purpose of review: Describe and evaluate the integration of 3D printing-related innovations into current cardiovascular treatment paradigms and examine the state of regulatory and reimbursement hurdles ahead. Recent findings: Mounting years of clinical experience have established the utility of printed models of patient anatomy in numerous treatment and teaching scenarios, most notably as pre- and intra-procedural planning tools guiding decision-making for congenital heart disease and catheter-based interventions. In part due to a continued lack of reimbursement and under-defined (and slow to evolve) regulatory status, these use cases remain largely investigational even as they grow increasingly routine. Patients, physicians, and/or imaging centers therefore remain burdened by the associated cost to create such models, and the perceptual and decision-making enhancements, while demonstrable and significant, still may not clearly or independently justify a potentially high cost. Simulation and implantable device applications may represent a deeper well of unrealized value in cardiovascular intervention; however, further development of these applications relies on—and is throttled by—progress in material science and tissue-engineering research. The relevance of simulation applications in recent years is also now in competition with digital analogs including augmented and virtual reality. Innovative incorporation of alternative manufacturing processes such as porous scaffold infusion, injection molding, and vascular mesh forming can provide immediate access to more realistic tissue-mimicking materials and custom implantable devices, while comparable and directly printable materials continue to be developed. Tissue-engineering applications remain years if not decades away from a more substantive role in translatable clinical research. Regulatory challenges associated with in-house manufacture of implantable investigational devices are complex and subject to change, and the success of some in navigating these hurdles in non-cardiovascular applications is instructive and encouraging. Summary: Complex geometries characterizing cardiovascular anatomy are an ideal use case for translating the perceptual advantages of printed models of patient anatomy into better decision-making, especially so in the setting of congenital or post-surgical anatomy.

Advancements and potential applications of microfluidic approaches-A review,"A micro-level technique so-called ""microfluidic technology or simply microfluidic"" has gained a special place as a powerful tool in bioengineering and biomedical engineering research due to its core advantages in modern science and engineering. Microfluidic technology has played a substantial role in numerous applications with special reference to bioscience, biomedical and biotechnological research. It has facilitated noteworthy development in various sectors of bio-research and upsurges the efficacy of research at the molecular level, in recent years. Microfluidic technology can manipulate sample volumes with precise control outside cellular microenvironment, at micro-level. Thus, enable the reduction of discrepancies between in vivo and in vitro environments and reduce the overall reaction time and cost. In this review, we discuss various integrations of microfluidic technologies into biotechnology and its paradigmatic significance in bio-research, supporting mechanical and chemical in vitro cellular microenvironment. Furthermore, specific innovations related to the application of microfluidics to advance microbial life, solitary and co-cultures along with a multiple-type cell culturing, cellular communications, cellular interactions, and population dynamics are also discussed.",Ahmed I.; Akram Z.; Bule M.; Iqbal H.,Journal,Chemosensors,2018-12-01,Griffith Health;Ambo University;Tecnológico de Monterrey,Biofilms ;  Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) ;  Micro-array ;  Microchannel ;  Microstructure ;  Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) ;  Reynolds number
Advancements in biocatalysis: From computational to metabolic engineering,"Through several waves of technological research and un-matched innovation strategies, bio-catalysis has been widely used at the industrial level. Because of the value of enzymes, methods for producing value-added compounds and industrially-relevant fine chemicals through biological methods have been developed. A broad spectrum of numerous biochemical pathways is catalyzed by enzymes, including enzymes that have not been identified. However, low catalytic efficacy, low stability, inhibition by non-cognate substrates, and intolerance to the harsh reaction conditions required for some chemical processes are considered as major limitations in applied bio-catalysis. Thus, the development of green catalysts with multi-catalytic features along with higher efficacy and induced stability are important for bio-catalysis. Implementation of computational science with metabolic engineering, synthetic biology, and machine learning routes offers novel alternatives for engineering novel catalysts. Here, we describe the role of synthetic biology and metabolic engineering in catalysis. Machine learning algorithms for catalysis and the choice of an algorithm for predicting protein-ligand interactions are discussed. The importance of molecular docking in predicting binding and catalytic functions is reviewed. Finally, we describe future challenges and perspectives",Khan A.; Bilal M.; Rasheed T.; Iqbal H.,Journal,Cuihua Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Catalysis,2018-12-01,State Key Laboratory of Microbial Metabolism;Huaiyin Institute of Technology;Shanghai Jiao Tong University;Tecnológico de Monterrey,Biocatalysis ;  Enzyme ;  Metabolic engineering ;  Synthetic biology
Innovations in biomedical nanoengineering: nanowell array biosensor,"Nanostructured biosensors have pioneered biomedical engineering by providing highly sensitive analyses of biomolecules. The nanowell array (NWA)-based biosensing platform is particularly innovative, where the small size of NWs within the array permits extremely profound sensing of a small quantity of biomolecules. Undoubtedly, the NWA geometry of a gently-sloped vertical wall is critical for selective docking of specific proteins without capillary resistances, and nanoprocessing has contributed to the fabrication of NWA electrodes on gold substrate such as molding process, e-beam lithography, and krypton-fluoride (KrF) stepper semiconductor method. The Lee group at the Mara Nanotech has established this NW-based biosensing technology during the past two decades by engineering highly sensitive electrochemical sensors and providing a broad range of detection methods from large molecules (e.g., cells or proteins) to small molecules (e.g., DNA and RNA). Nanosized gold dots in the NWA enhance the detection of electrochemical biosensing to the range of zeptomoles in precision against the complementary target DNA molecules. In this review, we discuss recent innovations in biomedical nanoengineering with a specific focus on novel NWA-based biosensors. We also describe our continuous efforts in achieving a label-free detection without non-specific binding while maintaining the activity and stability of immobilized biomolecules. This research can lay the foundation of a new platform for biomedical nanoengineering systems.",Seo Y.; Jeong S.; Lee J.; Choi H.; Kim J.; Lee H.,Journal,Nano Convergence,2018-12-01,"Korea Institute of Toxicology;Massachusetts General Hospital;Northeastern University;The City University of New York;Mara Nanotech New York, Inc.",Biomedical nanoengineering systems ;  Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) ;  Electrochemical sensor ;  Immunosensor ;  Nanobiosensor ;  Nanofabrication ;  Nanowell array electrode (NWA)
Telesurgery Robot Based on 5G Tactile Internet,"With the development of modern medical technology, the emerging 5G, tactile Internet, robot, and artificial intelligence technology have enabled the interdisciplinary innovations facilitating the development of the surgical treatment technology, and enhancing the treatment efficiency of various diseases. In the medical field, the introduction of robot technology has contributed to the telesurgery. Moreover, the telesurgery robot allocated with the 5G tactile Internet as infrastructure, and AI technology as core competitiveness can promote the audio, visual and tactile perceptions of a doctor during the surgery process and solve the problems of resource scheduling; accordingly, it has become the research hotspot. Therefore, this paper introduces a telesurgery robot based on the 5G tactile Internet and artificial intelligence technology. The architecture, composition, characteristics, and advantages of telesurgery are explained in detail from two aspects, the intelligent tactile feedback, and human-machine interaction data. On this basis, a human-machine interaction optimization scheme during the telesurgery process is presented from four aspects, i.e., Edge-Cloud Integration, network slice, and intelligent edge-cloud. Finally, this paper discusses the open issues of the presented telesurgery system regarding the ultra-high reliability, AI-enabled surgery robot, communication, and security, to provide the reference for the promotion of the telesurgery robot performance.",Miao Y.; Jiang Y.; Peng L.; Hossain M.; Muhammad G.,Journal,Mobile Networks and Applications,2018-12-01,Huazhong University of Science and Technology;King Saud University;Kyungpook National University (KNU),5G tactile Internet ;  Artificial intelligence ;  Human-machine interaction ;  Robot ;  Telesurgery
Collaboration mechanisms for sustainable innovation,"The purpose of this article is to advance research on sustainable innovation through a business model (hereafter, BM) perspective. We consider the BM as a boundary-spanning system that encompasses various firms, in which value is created, exchanged and captured. More specifically, we look at the changes called for by the imperative of sustainable development, through the perspective of the BM. When companies coalesce around well-entrenched BMs, sunk costs and lock-in effects emerge as formidable barriers for sustainable innovation. We posit that the multiple dimensions in which sustainable innovation creates value for BM participants have not been adequately studied. In this article, we seek to address that gap by exploring the following research questions: What mechanisms enable transactions in boundary-spanning BMs that seek to bring about sustainable innovation? Are there synergies or otherwise meaningful connections between the different collaboration mechanisms? Are there enabling mechanisms that may facilitate or hinder those mechanisms? We look at the BM of three green innovators: new entrants that created a niche in their industries with clear social and environmental advantages over imperfect substitutes. Our main contributions to the literature on sustainable innovation are: (1) the integration of social and environmental collaboration mechanisms in addition to the economic ones used by extant studies; (2) the identification of the connections among these social, economic and environmental collaboration mechanisms; and (3) the identification of a set of enabling conditions within the focal firms that facilitate collaboration at the BM level. We close with propositions about enabling conditions, collaboration mechanisms and outcomes (sustainable innovations).",Reficco E.; Gutiérrez R.; Jaén M.; Auletta N.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2018-12-01,"EGADE Business School;Universidad de Los Andes, Colombia;IESA",Business model ;  Collaboration mechanisms ;  Corporate sustainability ;  Latin America ;  Sustainable enterprise ;  Sustainable innovation
Designing and implementing an environment for software start-up education: Patterns and anti-patterns,"Today's students are prospective entrepreneurs, as well as potential employees in modern, start-up-like intrapreneurship environments within established companies. In these settings, software development projects face extreme requirements in terms of innovation and attractiveness of the end-product. They also suffer severe consequences of failure such as termination of the development effort and bankruptcy. As the abilities needed in start-ups are not among those traditionally taught in universities, new knowledge and skills are required to prepare students for the volatile environment that new market entrants face. This article reports experiences gained during seven years of teaching start-up knowledge and skills in a higher-education institution. Using a design-based research approach, we have developed the Software Factory, an educational environment for experiential, project-based learning. We offer a collection of patterns and anti-patterns that help educational institutions to design, implement and operate physical environments, curricula and teaching materials, and to plan interventions that may be required for project-based start-up education.",Fagerholm F.; Hellas A.; Luukkainen M.; Kyllönen K.; Yaman S.; Mäenpää H.,Journal,Journal of Systems and Software,2018-12-01,Helsingin Yliopisto,Computer science ;  Curriculum ;  Experiential learning ;  Project-based learning ;  Software engineering ;  Start-up education
Knowledge flow in low-carbon technology transfer: A case of India's wind power industry,"The degree of knowledge flow in low-carbon technology transfer is influenced by its organizational mechanism. While transfer mechanisms involving greater cross-border interaction and recipient effort may provide more learning opportunities, there remains a gap about the causal mechanisms and contingent variables involved in technology transfer and technological capability development. This study offers one of the first firm-level causal analyses of transfer mechanisms and technological capabilities, taking into account various firm- and context-specific factors. To this end, India's wind power industry is analyzed using firm-level data and semi-structured interviews conducted in 2013 with 15 wind turbine manufacturers covering 76% of the market share and 12 other organizations working on wind power. The analysis demonstrates that innovation capabilities are accumulated mainly through transfer mechanisms enabling recipients’ engagement in research and development. Mergers and acquisitions as well as international research and development centers are among the most effective examples. Joint ventures could be appropriate if a local partner gains a large majority shareholding. The knowledge transfer through wholly foreign-owned enterprises may be restricted because intellectual properties are tightly controlled by their parent firms. The creation of a predictable, performance-oriented market enhances firms’ financial resources and consequently encourages knowledge acquisition and capability development.",Hayashi D.,Journal,Energy Policy,2018-12-01,Ritsumeikan University,India ;  Innovation ;  Knowledge ;  Technological capabilities ;  Technology transfer ;  Wind power
Strategies for technology-driven service encounters for patient experience satisfaction in hospitals,"This study empirically examines the effects of a patient learning experience and technology-driven service encounters on patients’ satisfaction with their experience in using self-service capabilities of digital devices and systems in large hospitals. The research model and associated hypotheses were tested using structural equations modeling based on data collected from 212 patients who had care experience at large hospitals in metropolitan areas of South Korea. The findings of the study indicate that patients’ learning experience with technologies and technology-driven service encounters encourage patients to participate in the treatment process, which in turn positively affect patients’ experience satisfaction. The study results present implications regarding the relationships among patient learning, technology-driven service encounters, participation in treatment processes, and experience satisfaction. The study also provides new insights to hospital administrators regarding investment strategies in medical technologies to optimize their impact on care quality and patient experience satisfaction. Technology-driven devices and systems are especially critical for knowledge-intensive transformative institutions like hospitals for quality patient services and efficient operations. Thus, healthcare organizations should minimize the disruptive effect of innovative technological applications by developing effective planning, education/training, and user guide.",Lee D.,Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2018-12-01,Inha University,Healthcare industry ;  Learning experience ;  Medical technologies ;  Patient experience satisfaction ;  Technology-driven service encounters
"Boundary Spanning, Group Heterogeneity and Engineering Project Performance","This study examines the concept of intra-organizational links as a way for boundary spanners to bring into the project group the information needed to deal with task uncertainty. Several studies have shown that heterogeneous groups are superior to homogeneous groups when novel or creative solutions need to be developed to deal with tasks characterized by high task uncertainty. For boundary spanners in engineering project groups, it is proposed that cross-departmental technical advice links are another source of the information needed to deal with task uncertainty. An empirical test supports the proposition that for high-performing project groups, boundary-spanning technical advice links may compensate for a lack of internal group heterogeneity and vice versa. This is not the case for low-performing project groups. Implications of these finding are presented, including the direction that the open innovation research stream might take to address the findings of this study.",Wilson D.; Ettlie J.,Journal,International Journal of Innovation and Technology Management,2018-12-01,Saunders College of Business,Boundary-spanning ;  group heterogeneity ;  link multiplexity ;  open innovation ;  project group performance ;  task uncertainty
Open innovation/integration versus disintermediation/disintegration,"Supply chain disintegration is considered, due to its importance as an enabler for the management of technology innovation. This research is urgent as it is relevant to a wide range of other occurrences outside of technology innovation management, including: major policy or regulatory changes, industrial actions, economic sanctions, trade wars, trade realignment – such as Brexit, natural disasters, civil disorder and conflict, and financial crises. Disintegration is the re-alignment of partners and coordination within a supply chain to enhance customer value. This process is driven by one of more of the following: introduction of new technology or input, elimination of existing technology or input, change in customer requirements, and/or change in other external factors. The interdisciplinary nature and intellectual foundations of disintegration are considered. Finally, areas of research need are offered.",Linton J.,Journal,Technovation,2018-12-01,HSE University;The University of Sheffield,

"Realizing 5G vision through Cloud RAN: technologies, challenges, and trends","Achieving the fifth-generation (5G) vision will introduce new technology innovations and substantial changes in delivering cutting-edge applications and services in current mobile and cellular networks. The Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) concept emerged as one of the most compelling architectures to meet the requirements of the 5G vision. In essence, C-RAN provides an advanced mobile network architecture which can leverage challenging features such as network resource slicing, statistical multiplexing, energy efficiency, and high capacity. The realization of C-RAN is achieved by innovative technologies such as the software-defined networking (SDN) and the network function virtualization (NFV). While SDN technology brings the separation of the control and data planes in the playground, supporting thus advanced traffic engineering techniques such as load balancing, the NFV concept offers high flexibility by allowing network resource sharing in a dynamic way. Although SDN and NFV have many advantages, a number of challenges have to be addressed before the commercial deployment of 5G implementation. In addition, C-RAN introduces a new layer in the mobile network, denoted as the fronthaul, which is adopted from the recent research efforts in the fiber-wireless (Fi-Wi) paradigm. As the fronthaul defines a link between a baseband unit (BBU) and a remote radio unit (RRU), various technologies can be used for this purpose such as optical fibers and millimeter-wave (mm-wave) radios. In this way, several challenges are highlighted which depend on the technology used. In the light of the aforementioned remarks, this paper compiles a list of challenges and open issues of the emerging technologies that realize the C-RAN concept. Moreover, comparative insights between the current and future state of the C-RAN concept are discussed. Trends and advances of those technologies are also examined towards shedding light on the proliferation of 5G through the C-RAN concept.",Pliatsios D.; Sarigiannidis P.; Goudos S.; Karagiannidis G.,Journal,Eurasip Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking,2018-12-01,Aristotle University of Thessaloniki;University of Western Macedonia,5G ;  Cloud Radio Access Network ;  Common Public Radio Interface ;  Network function virtualization ;  Software-defined networking
"Failing worse? Science, security and the birth of a border technology","Despite increased attention, investment and research, the security technologies deployed at sovereign borders often fail to ‘properly’ distinguish between safe and dangerous travellers and goods. This article transposes on-site border malfunctions into the antecedent register of research and development in order to explore how failure operates in the design, construction and testing of a border security technology. Drawing from extensive ethnographic research of a European-wide project to develop the Handhold portable chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive (CBRNE) detector, this article traces how failure is mobilized as an instructive experience in the professional cultures of science, engineering and governance, and retrospectively narrated as a necessary step on the road to eventual success. In exploring the limitations of this understanding, the article demonstrates how competing experiences of failure constantly trouble the daily routines of scientists and engineers, shape informal de-risking strategies, and fuel the relentless pursuit of innovation. To contest the dominant account of failure as an instructive experience, the article argues that more creative and critical research into the heterogeneous life-worlds of failure is needed in order to politicize the consequences of border failures and connect them to the antecedent register of scientific research and development.",Lisle D.,Journal,European Journal of International Relations,2018-12-01,Queen's University Belfast,Borders ;  failure ;  innovation ;  risk ;  security ;  technology
A Novel Dual-Step Nucleation Pathway in Crystalline Solids under Neutron Irradiation,"Innovations in nanostructuring of inorganic crystalline solids are often limited by prerequisite critical nucleation energy and solute supersaturation for formation of a phase. This research provides direct evidence supporting the viability of an unconventional irradiation-induced nanostructuring process, via transmission electron microscopy, that circumvents these preconditions. Using polymorphic silicon carbide (SiC) as a prototype, a surprising two-step nucleation route is demonstrated through which nanoscale distribution of the second phase is achieved by reaction of solutes with neutron irradiation-induced precursors. In the first step, nanoscale α-SiC precipitates in a β-SiC matrix unexpectedly nucleate heterogeneously at structural defects. This occurs at significantly lower temperatures compared with the usual β→α transition temperature. Subsequently, α-SiC precipitate acts as a surrogate template for its structural and compositional transition into a fission product precipitate, palladium silicide. These discoveries provide a modern view of irradiation engineering in polymorphic ceramics for advanced applications.",Meher S.; Van Rooyen I.; Lillo T.,Journal,Scientific Reports,2018-12-01,Idaho National Laboratory,
Innovations in science education: infusing social emotional principles into early STEM learning,"We report on the development of an after-school and summer-based science, technology, engineering, and mathematics curriculum infused with the arts and social emotional learning content (STEAM SEL). Its design was motivated by theory and research that suggest that STEM education is well-suited for teaching empathy and other emotion-related skills. In this paper, we describe the activities associated with the development and design of the program and the curriculum. We provide expert-ratings of the STEAM and social emotional elements of the program and present instructor and participant feedback about the program’s content and its delivery. Our results revealed that infusing the arts and social emotional learning content into science education created a holistic STEM-related curriculum that holds potential for enhancing young children’s interest in and appreciation for science and its applications. The data also suggested that the program was well-developed and, generally well-executed. However, experts rated the STEAM elements of the program more positively than the SEL elements, especially with regard to sequencing of lessons and integration among the lessons and hands-on activities, indicating that program revisions are warranted.",Garner P.; Gabitova N.; Gupta A.; Wood T.,Journal,Cultural Studies of Science Education,2018-12-01,George Mason University;iSchool for the Future,Science education ;  Social emotional learning ;  STEM education ;  Twenty-first century skills
Importance of innovation and flexibility in configuring supply network sustainability,"Purpose: The alignment of procurement strategy with overall business strategy is important for superior firm performance. It is also essential for firms’ purchasing structure to fit the purchasing strategy whether it is cost reduction; value analysis and/or improving delivery and increasing flexibility for achieving superior purchasing performance. The purpose of this paper is to scientifically examine the influence of organization culture (OC), green supplier development (GSD), supplier relationship management, flexibility and innovation on sustainability in supply network (SSN) under the moderation effect of institutional pressures and resources availability. Design/methodology/approach: The study is grounded by integrating institutional theory (IT) and resource-based view (RBV) theory. The study empirically tests the conceptual model through survey data gathered from 175 respondents in the KwaZulu-Natal province of Southern Africa using structural equation modeling which is a multivariate data analysis technique that permits to simultaneously examine many relationships among manifest and latent variables. Findings: It was found that OC plays a crucial role in shaping the workforce behavior and responsible for enhancing GSDs and building good relationship with suppliers which ultimately results into increased flexibility and innovativeness. Coercive pressures (CPs) play a moderating role between the causal relationship of innovation and SSN. Therefore, CPs have got the ability to amplify or reverse the effect between innovation and SSNs. Research limitations/implications: The study suffers from few limitations. First, the study is restricted to one particular province in South Africa. Second, cross-sectional data were used for testing of model in the research study. Practical implications: The findings are of great importance for both the researchers and supply chain practitioners. Supply chain practitioners may use this knowledge for benchmarking the supply network configuration process and continuously improve the process. The tested model actually shows the mechanism for enhancing SSNs. In today’s dynamic and uncertain business environment, all firms in the supply network aims to minimize risks and maximize profitability. The findings show that CPs play a moderating effect on the relationship between innovation and SSN. Whenever government authorities and institutions pressurize firms for minimizing pollution levels, we see a trend of increased innovations in the form of new product developments, usage of eco-friendly raw material and application of eco-friendly technology which ultimately minimizes the carbon footprint. Through such initiatives steel and engineering firms conform to the government norms and regulations. However, innovations are possible through collaboration with specialist suppliers and sub-suppliers by adopting a common standard across the supply network. Through this overall process of innovation, the focal firm and sub-suppliers linked in the network will benefit and ultimately achieve a competitive edge. Therefore, firms can experience multiple benefits in terms of lower development costs, lower project cycle completion time, improvement in design for re-manufacturability, low downtime, low supply risks, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and, ultimately, sustainable development. Originality/value: The study is unique from dual perspective – both in terms of scope and contribution to supply chain management literature. First, the study integrates flexibility and innovation to study the impact on SSNs. Second, it integrates both IT and RBV theory of firm to test the moderation effect and the findings further opens up window for future research.",Bag S.; Gupta S.; Telukdarie A.,Journal,Benchmarking,2018-11-29,Sambalpur University;University of Johannesburg,Collaborative relationships ;  Flexibility ;  Innovation ;  Institutional theory ;  Resource-based view ;  Sustainability in supply networks
Innovation driven ecosystem for quality skill development in India,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate and analyze the challenges of quality skill development in complex and large economies like India and develop innovative processes of improving employability. Design/methodology/approach: The problem areas and gaps have been identified through literature survey and published reports by governmental agencies on employability and quality skill development in India. The research focuses on prevalent challenges for large-scale skill development and utilizes TRIZ (Russian acronym for “Theory of Inventive Problem Solving”) for finding innovative solutions to the grand challenge of employability. Findings: The applied research methodology in the paper leads to a model for the “Innovation driven ecosystem for quality skill development” and also defines the role and responsibilities of each stakeholders in the ecosystem. Research limitations/implications: Solutions derived through TRIZ are qualitative in nature. The actual implication of solution needs to be tested after implementation. Further, intangible costs incurred, and harmful and useful effects cannot be easily quantified. Practical implications: The parameter mapping for the TRIZ matrix was undertaken in this paper and this methodology when applied to other problem statements renders an organized process for improving total quality and innovative process management. The inventive principles were applied to find solution to contradictions and arrive at an integrated ecosystem which binds all stakeholders efficiently, to generate higher employability. The innovative solutions derived through the process are applicable to policy makers, researchers and practitioners. Social implications: The process of improving employability through quality skill development, benchmarked by the TRIZ methodology can have far reaching social implications. Originality/value: The research extends the body of knowledge of TRIZ modeling concepts in areas other than engineering, and depicts a unique total quality methodology which can be easily applied for other problem-solving contexts. The contribution can serve as a reference technique/tool for improving reliability and quality through a methodical process of working out innovative solutions to solve operational problems.",Shrotriya S.; Dhir S.; Sushil.,Journal,Benchmarking,2018-11-29,Indian Institute of Technology Delhi,Contradictions ;  Employability ;  Innovation ecosystem ;  Inventive solutions ;  Quality skill development ;  TRIZ
Cyclic management of innovative pss changes: An integrated and interdisciplinary engineering view,"In today's globalization process technical Product-Service Systems (PSS) are subject to cyclic innovations. These innovations imply different changes in various engineering domains (i.e. product development, manufacturing systems and automated Production Systems). To cope with these changes, various approaches are developed within each domain. On the contrary, these domains are tightly coupled and thus, an integrated view often impedes successful management of changes. Building on the work of an interdisciplinary research collaboration, we present various methods and models addressing change management. Subsequently, we classify these approaches and explore how an interdisciplinary view can enrich integrated change management. Finally, we derive a representative use case, which will serve as demonstration case for the obtained scientific results and practical tool in the context of interdisciplinary change management for technical PSS.",Koltun G.; Neumann E.; Kattner N.; Bauer H.; Lindemann U.; Reinhart G.; Vogel-Heuser B.,Conference Proceeding,"4th IEEE International Symposium on Systems Engineering, ISSE 2018 - Proceedings",2018-11-26,Technische Universität München,Automated Production System ;  Change Management ;  Collaborative Work ;  Innovation Management ;  Manufacturing Systems ;  Product Development ;  Product-Service-System
The status quo and ways of STEAM education promoting China's future social sustainable development,"In the process of future sustainable development, human society faces problems such as severe population load, economic transition, and a lack of educational measures. One of the root causes of these problems is the shortage of innovative talents. Therefore, how to cultivate learners with multidisciplinary integration and innovation ability is a key point that should be paid attention to when promoting the concept of quality education and coping with the future sustainable development process. This paper uses the questionnaire survey and literature analysis methods to analyze the development of many educational institutions with the Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics (STEAM) concept as the core in China since 2017. It is found that the existing STEAM educational institutions generally have the following problems: a lack of team composition, difficulty in independent research and development, single course content, and an insufficient validation of course effectiveness. In order to more effectively promote the sustainable development of China's future course, STEAM education institutions should focus on strengthening the following development strategies: gradient team building, continuous independent research and development, cutting-edge projects, mechanisms of curriculum transformation, and multi-angle course effectiveness verification.",Wang X.; Xu W.; Guo L.,Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2018-11-26,China University of Petroleum (East China),Cultivating competitiveness ;  Integrating innovative talents ;  Multi-dimensional status analysis ;  STEAM
“Flipping or flapping?” investigating engineering students’ experience in flipped classrooms,"Purpose: This study has explored the flipped classroom model in a private university in Malaysia. It aims to present a flipped classroom intervention for engineering education innovation. Design/methodology/approach: The research (1) revisited prominent educational theories for a flipping or flapping pedagogy, (2) implemented and explored the flipped classroom experiences in one engineering subject using the action inquiry method with thematic analysis and (3) reflectively evaluated both students’ and educators’ “flipping or flapping experience”. Findings: The responses of the research participants are analysed and used to develop the flipping or flapping classroom principles and an ideal flipped classroom model. From passive lectures to active learning with collaborative discourse and reflective communication, flipping the classroom can offer a seamless learning experience. Research limitations/implications: The flipped classroom model can provide good reference for other educational researchers who intended to conduct a flipped classroom. However, the small sample size with qualitative method and thematic analysis useds led to considerable theoretical development, but it may not achieve the validity standards to generalise the findings. Further empirical investigation with a systematic controlled group is recommended for future work across disciplines for extrapolation. Originality/value: This is a genuine case study with an identified innovative teaching need to investigate how flipped classrooms can be enabled and enhanced in engineering education innovation.",Chew E.; Jones L.; Wordley S.,Journal,On the Horizon,2018-11-26,Cardiff Metropolitan University;Monash University Malaysia,Blended learning ;  Flipped classroom ;  Technology enhanced learning

Attraction and Retention of Women in Engineering,"With the advance of digital society it is imperative to attract and retain women specialists in engineering. To identify gender patterns of career choice in Russia and the problems Russian women specialists face while adapting to work environments in STEM, we conducted a series of expert interviews with young women engineers in the spring of 2018 and compared the data with the results of the 2013-2014 studies. We came to the conclusion that although some of the professional gender-related stereotypes still persist, they also undergo active transformation. Women's success in undergraduate STEM education makes them feel more empowered to continue their post-graduate studies and to pursue careers in engineering. We also found that the current policy of attracting more women to the field of engineering, high-tech industries and innovation has had a certain effect on women's choice of profession and career plans.

CAMELOT - Localization Beacon System,"C2 Advanced Multi-Domain Environment And Live Observation Technologies (CAMELOT) is a H2020 project intended to develop and demonstrate different advanced command and control service modules for multiple platform domains customizable to the user needs. Currently, there is no widespread standard for multi-service, multi-domain command and control (C2) systems. The CAMELOT architecture and modules will help build critical support in both the industrial and the practitioner communities leading to the adoption of these technologies. The underwater domain is a special case in command and control as communication and localization have to be implemented in a completely different way. The underwater domain is reached using one or many, mobile or stationary surface assets that act as gateways. The same assets provide underwater assets with positional updates. The localization beacon system (LBS) is a novel localization system being developed in the scope of the CAMELOT project. LBS provides assets with position data in a unidirectional way. The beacon is composed of a circular transducer array which signals vary in properties from one another thus allowing assets to hear a composite signal that varies depending on the bearing from the beacon. As the beacon can be mobile a parallel acoustic modem message is sent informing assets of the beacon pose and other relevant data. To keep the method unidirectional synchronized clocks are used for ranging thus allowing any listener to calculate its position using only a receiving hydrophone. As the underwater robotic world is growing and more and more multi-platform solutions are being proposed for various maritime missions and tasks, this LBS brings an advantage in comparison to classic underwater positioning systems as it provides a constant position update rate invariant to the number of assets. Assets are 'linked' using an acoustic modem network allowing them to exchange data and inform the C2 station of their status. The JANUS acoustic modem standard is used to render the system in the spirit of the CAMELOT project. This paper presents the LBS concept using simulated signals and provides analysis of the expected accuracy for the later experiments.

Out of site: Empowering a new approach to online boycotts,"GrabYourWallet, #boycottNRA and other online boycott campaigns have attracted substantial public interest in recent months. However, a number of significant challenges are preventing online boycotts from reaching their potential. In particular, complex webs of brands and subsidiaries can make it difficult for participants to conform to the goals of a boycott. Similarly, participants and organizers have limited visibility into a boycott’s progress. This affects their ability to use sociotechnical innovations from social computing to incentivize participation. To address these challenges, this paper makes a system contribution: A new boycott tool called Out of Site. Out of Site uses lightweight automation to remove obstacles to successful online boycotts. We describe the design challenges associated with Out of Site and report results from two phases of deployment with the GrabYourWallet and Stop Animal Testing boycott communities. Our findings highlight the potential of boycott-assisting technologies and inform the design of this new class of technologies. Finally, like is the case for many systems in social computing, while we designed Out of Site for pro-social uses, there are a number of easily predictable ways in which the system can be leveraged for anti-social purposes (e.g. exacerbating filter bubble issues, empowering boycotts of businesses owned by racial, ethnic, and religious minorities). As such, we developed for this project a new, very straightforward design approach that treats preventing these anti-social uses as a top-tier design concern. This approach stands in contrast to the status quo of ignoring potential anti-social uses and/or considering them to be a secondary design priority. We discuss how our simple approach may help other research projects reduce their potential negative impacts with minimal burden.",Li H.; Alarcon B.; Espinosa S.; Hecht B.,Journal,Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction,2018-11-01,Northwestern University,Boycott ;  Collective action ;  Negative impacts ;  Social computing systems
Development analysis for fertilizer utilization of agricultural planting and animal wastes in China,"In recent years, a large number of wastes increase rapidly with the agriculture and livestock development in China. However, these wastes aggravate environmental pollution and lead to cause resource wasting due to the lack of understanding on the agricultural and livestock wastes that as an available resource, especially using for organic fertilizer. Under the policy background of ""speeding up the resources utilization of wastes "", in order to solve some problems on organic fertilizer utilization for wastes of agricultural and animal wastes, the innovation of technology and equipment should be speed up to utilize potential nutrients pool of wastes. It is of important to reduce the input of chemical fertilizer and to mitigate agricultural non-point source pollution, also has great significance to promote the green and healthy development for agriculture and guarantee the implementation of the strategy of ""storing grain in the land"" in China. Therefore, we analyzed the present situation for fertilizer utilization of agricultural and animal wastes in China using the total amount and utilization proportion of organic wastes. Also, we summarized the main ways and related technologies for fertilization utilization of wastes including crop straw returning, aerobic composting, returned by straw-animal-excretion, edible mushrooms cultivating, anaerobic digestion, charring or producing commercial organic fertilizer. However, there were many existing problems on the organic fertilizer utilization of agricultural and animal wastes such as the total amounts of waste was unclear and could not be collected unified, the sources quality of organic fertilizer from agricultural and animal wastes was uneven, the technology and equipment for organic fertilizer utilization was still lagging behind, the quality and market competitiveness of organic fertilizer was insufficient, the relevant policy guidance for organic fertilizer utilization of waste was lack. Meanwhile, we presented homologous countermeasures and suggestion according to these unsolved problems, which should be formulating collection and transportation systems of agricultural and animal wastes, improving core technology innovation on organic fertilizer utilization, strengthening the supervision of organic fertilizer market and enhancing the market competitiveness. These suggestions would promote to develop with the right direction for the organic fertilizer utilization of agricultural and animal wastes, and possibly some problems such as wastes disposal of large-scale livestock and poultry farm and crop straws using for organic fertilizer could be resolved, which also provide a reference for resource utilization of agricultural and animal wastes, especially the development of organic fertilizer utilization in China. Future, the technological innovation on optimized fermentation, non-hazardous treatment and organic fertilizer safe utilization of agricultural and animal wastes should be intensified in China. The new subject, new form, new industry for organic fertilizer utilization of wastes should be established to improve the clean process of livestock and the ecological production of wastes utilization. The utilization efficiency for organic fertilizer of agricultural and animal wastes would be increased by a newly formed situation including industrialization development, market-oriented management and scientific management and socialized service. Therefore, a newly historical opportunity for the organic fertilizer utilization of agricultural and animal wastes will be brought due to the development of science and technology, the increase of the environmental protection and the support of governmental policy in our country.",Tian S.; Guo H.; Yao L.; Gong Z.; Dong L.; Bian W.; Luo J.; Zhang Y.,Journal,Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering,2018-11-01,Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences;AgResearch Ruakura,Advance ;  Agriculture and livestock ;  Manures ;  Organic fertilizer utilization of wastes ;  Resource utilization of wastes ;  Straw ;  Waste disposal

Collaborative intelligence cyber-physical system for the valorization and re-use of cultural heritage,"This paper is a proposition of methodological and technological approaches that try to constitute a framework that introduces modern artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for decision-making in the adaptive reuse of cultural heritage (CH) processes. The research aims to accelerate and improve the quality of adaptive CH re-use. The complexity of the problem derives from some causes of different nature: lack of attention to this problem from the public administration and private investors; decision-making processes complicated by the need to connect with experts, located in different countries. Most professionals, related to the CH management, cannot access detailed data about already existing successful initiatives. The specific objective and goal of the research is the creation of an AI framework and eco-system for supporting the development and implementation of innovative business and governance models to fill up the investment gap in the adaptive re-use practices. The paper shortly describes the first steps for creating a platform designed and developed to assist and advice public entities, networked experts, private entrepreneurs and citizens in actions aiming at the valorisation of the historic and CH asset and its integration in different groups of countries to boost growth, job opportunities and social benefits, under overall sustainability constraints. The technical solutions here adopted are based on convergent methodology and networked expertise (e-expertise) technology, open data models and active knowledge extraction and processing, machine learning, collective intelligence, recommendation systems and predictive analytics, CH adaptive re-use, innovation business, and models and case-based reasoning methods.

"Is space the new frontier for omics? Mars-omics, planetary science, and the next-generation technology futurists","Omics technologies are key to research and innovation in human health, food and nutrition, drugs, agriculture, and ecology research. Yet, the actual scope of applications is much broader. One emerging possibility is planetary science driven in part by current debates on and possibilities for travel to Mars. In July 2018, radar evidence has suggested the presence of subglacial liquid water in a 20-km-wide zone, likely a saltwater lake, in the Planum Australe region in the south pole of Mars. If confirmed, this will be a promising place to search for microbial life on the red planet. Meanwhile, existential threats to life on earth such as climate change are bolstering the current interests by spacefaring nations for manned long-term space travel to other planets. A new global space industry is also on the rise; Mars-related technology innovation could potentially allow for rapid Earth-to-Earth transport as well, for example, in times of humanitarian and ecological crisis. Against this overarching context, we coin and define here the new concept of ""Mars-omics"": the systems level study of how travel to and being on Mars affect human health, and how human presence on Mars impacts the life forms that might already be there, through changes such as space agriculture and other planetary transformations in Mars. Additionally, Mars-omics calls for new ways of thinking about scientific uncertainty and technology futures in such highly novel contexts. For example, how shall we frame scientific uncertainty when extrapolation of scientific unknowns across the planets is vastly difficult, nonlinear, and complex? Is uncertainty an accident or integral part of emerging technologies? These questions are important for achieving new relevance for and future progress in omics system science applications in planetary science and space explorations. In summary, this article suggests that omics has relevance in contexts beyond those on planet Earth.

OR air quality: Is it time to consider adjunctive air cleaning technology?,"Patients undergoing surgery may be at risk for infection from airborne particles such as dust, skin scales, respiratory aerosols, and hair fibers emanating from multiple sources in the OR, including personnel, heater-cooler devices, and surgical smoke. This risk is increased in surgical patients undergoing procedures involving implanted devices. Surgical personnel also are at risk from exposure to surgical smoke, which can contain viable viral particles including human papillomavirus infection. Air quality in the OR is improved by engineering controls (eg, maintaining positive pressure). During the past decade, innovations in the field of adjunctive technology designed to improve OR air quality include using ultraviolet disinfection and mobile ultraviolet disinfection plus high-efficiency particulate air filtration. Some of these technologies additionally provide continuous monitoring of circulating air particle counts. Additional research regarding the benefits of adjunctive air-cleaning technology in the OR is warranted.",Barnes S.; Twomey C.; Carrico R.; Murphy C.; Warye K.,Journal,AORN Journal,2018-11-01,Bond University;University of Louisville School of Medicine;Infection Control Plus Pty Ltd;Irrimax Corporation,Air cleaning technology ;  Heater-cooler units ;  Mycobacterium chimaera ;  Surgical plume ;  Surgical smoke
Fuzzy logic system interference in ship accidents,"Poor lookout, lack of situation awareness, and delayed response have been continuously recognized as contributory causes of navigation accidents (i.e., collisions and groundings). It is claimed that such negative behavioral characteristics can be corrected when the navigation system is equipped with the automation capability to intervene upon their detection. Building on the results of my previous work, this study sets the starting line in exploring this technological innovation under a conceptual framework, where it is attempted to employ simple, quantifiable, and measurable ways to assess the deck officer's (navigator's) complex aspect of mental task reliability. To deal with this challenge, the navigator's behavior when performing navigation tasks is described by the Markov method and the uncertainty, ambiguity, and weakness in perceiving accurately the environment and traffic conditions is determined by fuzzy logic. The proposed concept is demonstrated through its practical application in collision and grounding accidents, where it is argued that further research is required for its validation.",Psarros G.,Journal,Human Factors and Ergonomics In Manufacturing,2018-11-01,DNV GL AS,automation ;  cognitive/mental performance reliability ;  fuzzy logic ;  human factors ;  maritime accidents ;  Markov method
"Modularized production of fuels and other value-added products from distributed, wasted, or stranded feedstocks","Distributed, wasted, or stranded feedstocks, when converted and upgraded into fuels, could replace about 6% of the U.S. demand for liquid fuels, which is about 25% of the net import of petroleum by the United States. We review the current state of modular approaches for conversion of these feedstocks, including the technology and economics associated with processing carbon-containing waste and stranded, carbon-containing gas. The wide geographic distribution of the feedstocks will require technology that can be scaled down effectively and that can be manufactured, installed, operated and monitored in ways that gain economies of mass production rather than economies of throughput scaling.

Adoption behavior towards the use of nuclear technology in agriculture: A causal analysis,"Simultaneous achievement of sustainability, profitability, and productivity in the agricultural sector requires the development and utilization of appropriate technologies derived from agricultural research and extension of technological innovations in this sector. One of the most important issues in this respect is nuclear technology. Accordingly, the present study aims to carry out a causal analysis of the adoption behavior towards the use of nuclear technology in agriculture. The research method was descriptive-correlational and causal-relationship and a survey was used to collect the required data. The statistical population of this study consists of agricultural activists including faculty members of state departments of agriculture and research centers in Tehran and Alborz Provinces, Iran (N = 275); out of which, 160 individuals were selected through Krejcie and Morgan Table using stratified random sampling method with proportional assignment. The research instrument was a questionnaire, the validity of which was approved by a number of specialists in the field of agricultural education and extension as well as agricultural nuclear technology. The reliability of the whole items of the questionnaire was also obtained through a pilot study using Cronbach's alpha test (0.62≤α ≤ 0.82). The results of correlational tests showed that the variables of triability, compatibility, relative advantage, usefulness, attitude, social norms, and improved conditions (including social, cultural, political, and health-related items) have a positive and significant correlation with the behavior of adopting nuclear technology in agricultural sector. Moreover, the results of statistical tests of comparison of means (Kruskal-Wallis) revealed that the attitudes of faculty members in Agricultural Research Institute of Atomic Energy Organization in terms of views, knowledge, behavior, and tendency to nuclear technology adoption in agricultural sector were significantly different from those of other respondents. The causal analysis results showed that the component of improved conditions (social, cultural, political, and health-related items) had the greatest impact on the behavior of adopting nuclear technology in agriculture (β = 0.464).",Ebrahimi Sarcheshmeh E.; Bijani M.; Sadighi H.,Journal,Technology in Society,2018-11-01,Tarbiat Modares University,Adoption behavior ;  Agriculture ;  Nuclear technology
"Contribution of cellulose synthesis, formation of fibrils and their entanglement to the self-flocculation of Zymomonas mobilis","Due to the unique Entner-Doudoroff pathway, Zymomonas mobilis has been acknowledged as a potential host to be engineered for biorefinery to produce biofuels and biobased chemicals. The self-flocculation of Z. mobilis can make the bacterial cells self-immobilized within bioreactors for high density to improve product productivities, and in the meantime enhance their tolerance to stresses, particularly product inhibition and the toxicity of byproducts released during the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass. In this work, we explored mechanism underlying such a phenotype with the self-flocculating strain ZM401 developed from the regular non-flocculating strain ZM4. Cellulase de-flocculation and the restoration of the self-flocculating phenotype for the de-flocculated bacterial cells subjected to culture confirmed the essential role of cellulose biosynthesis in the self-flocculation of ZM401. Furthermore, the deactivation of both Type I and Type IV restriction-modification systems was performed for ZM4 and ZM401 to improve their transformation efficiencies. Comparative genome analysis detected the deletion of a thymine from ZMO1082 in ZM401, leading to a frame-shift mutation for the putative gene to be integrated into the neighboring downstream gene ZMO1083 encoding the catalytic subunit A of cellulose synthase, and consequently created a new gene to encode a larger transmembrane protein BcsA_401 for more efficient synthesis of cellulose as well as the development of cellulose fibrils and their entanglement for the self-flocculation of the mutant. These speculations were confirmed by the morphological observation of the bacterial cells under scanning electron microscopy, the impact of the gene deletion on the self-flocculation of ZM401, and the restoration of the self-flocculating phenotype of ZM401 ΔbcsA by the gene complementation. The progress will lay a foundation not only for fundamental research in deciphering molecular mechanisms underlying the self-flocculation of Z. mobilis and stress tolerance associated with the morphological change but also for technological innovations in engineering non-flocculating Z. mobilis and other bacterial species with the self-flocculating phenotype.",Xia J.; Liu C.; Zhao X.; Xiao Y.; Xia X.; Bai F.,Journal,Biotechnology and Bioengineering,2018-11-01,State Key Laboratory of Microbial Metabolism;Shanghai Jiao Tong University,cellulose synthesis ;  fibrils formation and entanglement ;  frame-shift mutation ;  self-flocculation ;  Zymomonas mobilis
The impact of security awarness on information technology professionals’ behavior,"Protecting digital assets is a growing concern for corporations, as cyberattacks affect business performance, reputation, and compromise intellectual property. Information technology (IT) security in general and cyber security, in particular, is a fast-evolving area that requires continuous evaluation and innovation. The objective of cyber-attacks has not changed over time however there is a shift in the attack methods through the increased use of social engineering, concentrating on the human elements as the weakest link in the security posture of any system network. This research looks at the relationship between threat awareness and countermeasure awareness on IT professionals’ compliance with desktop security behaviors. The model originally put forward by Hanus and Wu (2016), was tested on a population of 400 IT professionals across a broad range of IT roles and company sizes in the United States. The overall findings show that 61.2% of the variability in desktop security behavior can be explained by threat awareness and countermeasure awareness. In addition, the research found a determinant relationship between threat awareness and countermeasure awareness with the five elements of protective motivation theory (PMT), which include perceived severity, perceived vulnerability, self-efficacy, response efficacy, and response cost. Finally, the research shows that all elements of PMT, with the exception of perceived vulnerability, significantly determine desktop security behavior.",Torten R.; Reaiche C.; Boyle S.,Journal,Computers and Security,2018-11-01,"University of South Australia;The University of Adelaide;Marvell Semiconductor, Inc.",Cybersecurity ;  Human Behavior ;  Information Technology Security ;  IT Professionals ;  Protective Motivation Theory ;  Security Awareness Programs ;  Security Behavior ;  Social Engineering
Ecological technology model and path of seaport reclamation construction,"Reclamation plays an important role in alleviating the contradiction between the supply and demand of land. But its environmental negative effect is also obviously. Considerable research has been conducted on the environmental impact assessments of reclamation activities, but few and scattered studies have focused on how to reduce the negative impacts of reclamation projects on coastal ecosystems. Therefore, this paper considered the ecological technology integration study of reclamation construction as the breakthrough point. China, which has the highest reclamation scale worldwide, was also selected as the main research area, and its representative seaports were selected as the subjects of the study. Then, questionnaire survey and literature analysis were conducted. The ecological technology model and path of the seaport reclamation construction were studied by focusing on port site selection, port plane layout, wharf structure and plane form. Construction material selection and ecological restoration construction projects were also investigated. The suggestions regarding scientific demonstration and planning of port site selection, ecological port plane design and structure, application and innovation of recycling economy technology, and active construction of ecological restoration engineering were provided. The purpose of this research is to determine the effective implementation of ecological and environmentally friendly reclamation under a reasonable management scale, thus providing a reference for establishing the ecological technology model of reclamation and promoting the effective protection and sustainable development of marine resources from the perspective of source planning and management.",Chen Y.; Wei Y.; Peng L.,Journal,Ocean and Coastal Management,2018-11-01,Xiamen University,Ecological ;  Reclamation ;  Seaport ;  Technology
Access to space: A new approach by the united nations office for outer space affairs,"In the context of UNISPACE+50, which will mark the 50th anniversary of the first UNISPACE conference held in Vienna in 1968, the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) has defined four pillars to address the future of space activities and their role in development: space economy, space society, space accessibility and space diplomacy. Under the space accessibility pillar, UNOOSA intends to enable all communities, particularly in developing countries, to use and benefit from space technologies and applications. Building on previous activities and new partnerships, UNOOSA facilitates and provides (i) access to space education; (ii) access to space data; (iii) access to space technology and research facilities; and finally, for the first time, (iv) direct access to space. At the core of these activities is microgravity research, from on-ground simulation to orbital opportunities, which is one of the main tools of the Human Space Technology Initiative. This shift from on-ground space education, applications, technology and simulation to on-orbit technology is directly linked to a UNISPACE+50 thematic priority on “Global partnerships in space exploration and innovation”. At this stage, three partnership programmes are incorporated in this strategy, with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, the China Manned Space Agency, and Sierra Nevada Corporation. These programmes provide access to a wide spectrum of Low Earth Orbit opportunities.",Kojima A.; Yárnoz D.; Di Pippo S.,Journal,Acta Astronautica,2018-11-01,United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs,
Bulding ambidexterity through creativity mechanisms: Contextual drivers of innovation success,"Do creativity methods consistently produce a significant net effect on innovation? Are the impacts of creativity methods related to operating context? Based on an ambidexterity perspective, we examine the effectiveness of different creativity methods on overcoming the tensions of the innovation process at individual and team levels. Drawing on European Union Community Innovation Survey (CIS2010) data collected from 23,537 firms, we estimate causal effects of creativity on innovation through a multivalued treatment effect methodology. Our results show that implementing ambidexterity in creativity methods increases the firm´s propensity to innovate and to introduce a market novelty. However, the effect on firm turnover is not always clear. Also, we detect that ambidexterity is more effective in firms that are large in size, have high levels of R&D investment and operate in manufacturing sectors. We discuss the implications of these findings for practice and for future research.",Revilla E.; Rodríguez-Prado B.,Journal,Research Policy,2018-11-01,IE Business School;Universidad de Valladolid,Causal effects ;  Contextual factors ;  Creativity ;  Innovation ;  Multivalued treatment
Functional centrality and innovation intensity: Employee-level analysis of the Telenor group,"Recent research on employee-level innovation focuses on scientists’ ability to source advanced knowledge and use it to create new ideas and innovation within a firm. The present paper introduces a new dimension to this literature: functional departments. We argue that functional centrality, namely the extent to which a functional department is central in the intra-organizational network, affects employees’ innovation intensity. We make use of a rich novel dataset at the employee-level for the Telenor Group, based on a large-scale survey among nearly 16,000 employees in all business units and functions of the company. The empirical results point out that employees’ innovation intensity is higher in departments that are centrally positioned in the company's internal network. Task characteristics such as quality orientation, entrepreneurial attitude and result pressure moderate the relationship between centrality and innovation.",Castellacci F.; Gulbrandsen M.; Hildrum J.; Martinkenaite I.; Simensen E.,Journal,Research Policy,2018-11-01,Telenor Group;Universitetet i Oslo,Employee-level innovation ;  Functional centrality ;  Functional departments ;  Innovation search
Anatomy of use-inspired researchers: From Pasteur's Quadrant to Pasteur's Cube model,"Pasteur's Quadrant model, published by Stokes in 1997, presents a two-dimensional abstract conceptual framework that proved immensely helpful to study and discuss institutional and policy arrangements in science. However, during the last 10 years the PQ model was also applied in a series of large-scale, survey-based studies worldwide to classify individual modern-day researchers according to their research orientation and performance. This paper argues that such applications are inadequate to capture key characteristics of individual researchers, especially those within the heterogeneous ‘Pasteur type’ group who engage in ‘use-inspired’ basic scientific research. Addressing this shortcoming, Pasteur's Cube (PC) model introduces a new heuristic tool. Departing from a three-dimensional conceptual framework of research-related activities, the model enables a range of typologies to describe and study the large variety of academics at today's research-intensive universities. The PC model's analytical robustness was tested empirically in two interrelated ‘proof of concept’ studies: an exploratory survey among 150 European universities and a follow-up case study of Leiden University in the Netherlands. Both studies, collecting data for the years 2010–2015, applied a metrics-based taxonomy to classify individual academic researchers according to four performance categories: scientific publication output, research collaboration with the business sector, patents filings, and being engaging in entrepreneurial activities. The collective results of both studies provide more clarity on relevant subgroups of use-inspired researchers. The PC model can be used to guide empirical, metrics-based investigations of research activities and productivities, applies this approach to two case studies, and demonstrates the utility of the method while also reinforcing and enriching the growing body of literature showing that cross-sectoral and cross-functional research activities are more scientifically productive than research carried out in isolation of the context of use. Introducing the ‘Crossover Collaborator’ subtype helps to explain why Pasteur type researchers tend to outperform other types of researchers in terms of publication output and citation impact.",Tijssen R.,Journal,Research Policy,2018-11-01,Universiteit Leiden;Stellenbosch University,Application oriented science ;  Classification system ;  Human resources analytics ;  Science and innovation policy ;  University researchers
Self-leadership and overcoming the time resource constraint: Accelerating innovation for new products,"Arguably the scarcest resource for startups in the commercialization of new products is time. Self-leadership - the self-direction and self-motivation - of the founder may help us to manage time scarcity by improving innovation speed. With limited structure or templates to follow in product development efforts, self-leadership could be a critical resource for technology entrepreneurs under closing windows of opportunities. Drawing from a sample of founders in the high-technology sector, controlling for a variety of venture-related attributes, higher levels of self-leadership was positively related to innovation speed, and even more positively related to innovation speed when entrepreneurs commercialize less radical products. We highlight self-leadership as an important behavioral and motivational resource for speeding product development in the new technology-based venture context. We also shed light on the value of self-leadership in accelerating the development of less radical, or incremental, product innovations. Our findings have implications for both entrepreneurship research and the self-leadership literature.",Marvel M.; Patel P.,Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2018-11-01,Ball State University;Villanova University,Innovation speed ;  opportunity exploitation ;  self-leadership ;  technology entrepreneurship
Evaluating the current state of rooftop agriculture in Western Europe: Categories and implementation constraints,"Urban agriculture (UA) is expanding in European cities and it has recently colonized the roof of buildings in the form of rooftop agriculture (RA), particularly due to urban land constraints. The implementation of RA has been done in multiple ways: from high-tech business-oriented solutions, often promoted by research and innovation programs of the European Commission, to agro-ecological and sociallyoriented initiatives lead by the citizenship. This paper evaluates the current state of RA implementation in Western Europe by reviewing existing projects. A systematic search through internet, UA-related networks and societies was performed to list the existing projects around Europe. A total of 33 initiatives were evaluated, including projects (concept and planned), implemented cases and already closed experiences. Four categories of RA project were revealed in Western Europe: gardens, farms, engineering and landscape. The multi-functionality of RA implies a combination of objectives and benefits, namely food and non-food production, economic and social services, financial and environmental impacts. The analysis also unveiled some implementation barriers that constrain the development of RA, limiting the long-term viability of existing projects. How many will remain in 5 years time? And how many will replace them, and find a sustainable system? This is the role of research teams to study these initiatives, to test technical options and policy regulations through socioeconomic models and scenarios to offer an enabling environment for RA to become one way for cities to cope with climate change, food and nutrition security, biodiversity management and human prosperity.",Sanyé-Mengual E.; Kahane R.; Gianquinto G.; Geoffriau E.,Book Series,Acta Horticulturae,2018-10-31,CIRAD;Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna;L'Institut Agro Rennes-Angers,Greenroof ;  UA business models ;  Urban agriculture ;  Urban landscape

Characterization of engineering properties of active soils stabilized with nanomaterial for sustainable infrastructure delivery,"Nanotechnology has been widely discussed in extant literature as a technological solution to several problems associated with the use of construction materials for sustainable infrastructure delivery. This paper discusses findings from research that investigated applications of Nanotechnology on active soils. It highlights research findings on various areas Nanotechnology can provide innovative solutions for sustainable infrastructure delivery. The paper uses results from analysis of laboratory tests to discuss improvements in soil engineering properties that result from re-engineering construction materials and processes. The research results demonstrate improvements in soil engineering properties that could result from re-engineering construction materials and/or processes. The engineering properties of active soils investigated include: Atteberg Limits (liquid limit-LL, plastic limit-PL etc.), Shrinkage, Dry density Bearing capacity, California Bearing Ratio (CBR), and hydrophobic behavior. Other engineering properties of the active soils investigated include: shrink-swell, water absorption, and activity ratings /classification. Improvements were observed on the engineering properties of soils treated with the nanomaterial. The LL, PL, shrinkage, activity, and CBR showed the following levels of improvement: −24.21, 54.02, −50.24, −38, −12,59, and 14% respectively, while the shrink-swell, and water absorption improved by over 60 and 70% respectively. The soils also showed improved hydrophobicity when treated with nanomaterial. The activity ratings transitioned between low, high, and very high depending on the mineralogical and chemical compositions of the soils in their natural states. Statistical tests confirmed that the improvements were attributable to the nanomaterial agent in the active soil samples. However, the statistical tests show that addition of nanomaterial did not have effect on unconfined compressive strength and maximum dry density of the active soil. The paper concludes that given some potential risks in Nanotechnology applications in construction, there is an overarching need to formulate National policies and roadmaps for broader Nanotechnology applications in construction industries at country-specific levels.",Ugwu O.; Ogboin A.; Nwoji C.,Journal,Frontiers in Built Environment,2018-10-30,"Niger Delta University;Alex Ekwueme Federal University, Ndufu-Alike;University of Nigeria",Characterization ;  Construction process innovation ;  Expansive soil stabilization ;  Infrastructure sustainability ;  Nanotechnology ;  Sustainable built environment ;  Sustainable engineering practice

Innovations in humanitarian supply chains: the case of cash transfer programmes,"Cash transfer programmes (CTPs) are revolutionizing humanitarian supply chains (HSCs), yet just how CTPs are to be understood as innovation, and how they impact on HSCs, remains unclear. Innovation in the humanitarian context more often than not stems from outside humanitarian organizations–that is innovation occurs in their supply chain. The aim of this study is to further the understanding of supply chain innovation (SCI) in the humanitarian context. Based on empirical evidence this article suggests a supply chain innovation model (SCIM). This SCIM is useful because it allows different processes to be understood and compared, by providing guidance on how innovations progress. The contribution of this research is threefold: First, the research presents a SCIM for the humanitarian context. Second, this is the first application of a SCIM to the humanitarian environment. Finally, the research is field based and grounded in empirical observations thus adding to the literature and offering insights to practice.",Heaslip G.; Kovács G.; Haavisto I.,Journal,Production Planning and Control,2018-10-26,Atlantic Technological University;Hanken - Svenska handelshögskolan,cash transfer ;  diffusion ;  humanitarian supply chains ;  supply chain design ;  Supply chain innovation
Serum adoption challenges detection model: SACDM,"Scrum has been the most widely adopted Agile methodology over the past decade with Scrum and Scrum variants offering alternatives to the old software development methods. While Scrum plays an important role in the success of Agile development, it does come with its own challenges. In previous research challenges have been analyzed at the organizational and team level, primarily via case studies. However, fundamentally, Scrum needs to be adopted at the individual level. Furthermore, challenges such as inexperience, poor communication' specialization, lack of teamwork, low-quality, organizational culture and Scrum compatibility, have been identified as contributors. This paper therefore discusses the Scrum and Agile adoption challenges faced both globally as well as within the South African borders, from the findings of a narrative review. Secondly, a custom model adapted from the Diffusion of Innovation theoretical model was developed to detect the Scrum adoption challenges experienced within software organizations at the individual level. The custom model referred to as the Scrum Adoption Challenges Detection Model (SACDM) consists of four constructs, namely; individual factors, team factors, organizational factors and technology factors. The constructs are composed of nineteen independent variables that assists in understanding which factors contributes towards an individual either adopting or rejecting Scrum within a software organization. SACDM is therefore used to detect the adoption or rejection of Scrum as the dependent variable based on the independent variables being tested within the four constructs. The model can further be used with a survey questionnaire to provide generalized awareness of Scrum adoption challenges allowing software organizations to make more informed decisions when adopting Scrum, Future research is to allow the model to contribute towards Scrum adoption challenges predictive analysis.",Hanslo R.; Mnkandla P.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 2018 Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems, FedCSIS 2018",2018-10-26,University of South Africa,Adoption Challenges ;  Agile Methodologies ;  Scrum ;  Software Engineering ;  Software Organization

Artifact evaluation: FAD or real news?,"Data Management (DM), like many areas of computer science (CS), relies on empirical evaluation that uses software, data sets and benchmarks to evaluate new ideas and compare with past innovation. Despite the importance of these artifacts and associated information about experimental evaluations, few researchers make these available in a findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) manner, in this way hindering the scientific process by limiting open collaboration, credibility of published outcomes, and research progress. Fortunately, this problem is recognized and many CS communities, including the DM one, are advocating and providing incentives for software and analysis papers to follow FAIR principles and be treated equally to traditional publications. Some ACM/IEEE conferences adopted Artifact Evaluation (AE) to reward authors for doing a great job in conducting experiments with FAIR software and data.

Revisiting interactive art from an interaction design perspective: Opening a research agenda,"The articulation of art and science has been an important source of innovation and groundbreaking contributions in many domains throughout history. In this paper, we revisit the concept of interactive art, from an interaction design perspective, aiming at identifying the interaction approaches that emerge in interactive art examples found in the literature and also in other non-academic sources, such as online communities and digital games. Moreover, we investigate the use of frameworks and methodologies to support the design of interactive art. Results of this study illustrate the ways interaction approaches found in interactive art examples can inspire novel forms of interaction, which can also be useful in the design of interactive systems without artistic intent. Furthermore, frameworks and methodologies to support the design and evaluation of interactive art provide different ways to approach the design of interactive systems, giving focus to experiential aspects that otherwise could be overlooked.

The importance of empathy for analyzing privacy requirements,"Empathy is the first step of the design thinking (DT) paradigm, which has recently gained interest among software development organizations, leveraging the design and innovation processes for better meeting the required end-user experience. The DT paradigm places the customer needs up-front and emphasizes facilitating empathy with users, observing their behavior, and drawing conclusions about what people want and need. In this paper we analyze, through the lens of DT, findings of former research studies which indicated that by and large, software developers are not minded to privacy requirements. Our analysis demonstrates that the absence of empathy leads to neglecting important privacy concerns when designing software systems. Following this analysis, we posit that the empathy step, as manifested in the DT paradigm, is a necessary component of requirements engineering for unveiling and addressing the type of requirements that are at high risk of being overlooked. Employing empathy techniques and tools provided by the DT paradigm can foster empathy practices and skills of software engineers, who often do not practice empathy in their professional work.",Levy M.; Hadar I.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2018 5th International Workshop on Evolving Security and Privacy Requirements Engineering, ESPRE 2018",2018-10-19,University of Haifa,Design thinking ;  Empathy ;  Privacy ;  Requirements engineering ;  Software developers
Bridging the digital divide gap in BIM technology adoption,"Purpose: In the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry, a “digital divide” exists in technology adoption because SMEs (who often form the bulk of AEC organisations in most countries) are thought to be “Late Majority” and “Laggards” in the adoption of Building information modelling (BIM) technology. Larger organisations not saddled with financial and socio-technical constraints might be considered as being among the “Early Majority” or “Innovators”. It is crucial to understand how these organisations differ in their speed of BIM technology adoption and the rationale for this difference. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential causes of the digital divide and suggest solutions for bridging the gap. Design/methodology/approach: Using mixed research method, data were collected through online questionnaire survey of over 240 global respondents as well as a semi-structured interview with nine experts for which statistical and thematic analyses were used, respectively. Findings: Organisations can be zoned into “layers” and “levels” of BIM technology adoption and their size is not always significant in terms of the speed at which they adopt BIM. The digital divide is unequal across layers/levels and large organisations utilise technologies across the BIM maturity levels depending on project circumstances. A conceptual model for BIM technology was developed to aid identification of the “Laggards” and “Late Majority” from the “Innovators” through which change agents can customise adoption strategies for each group. Originality/value: The developed model could serve as a tool for engagement and policy making and it contributes to the body of knowledge in the field of BIM technology adoption.",Ayinla K.; Adamu Z.,Journal,"Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management",2018-10-19,Birmingham City University;Loughborough University,Building information modelling ;  Innovation ;  Organization ;  Technology
Lean talent management: a novel approach for increasing creativity in architectural design firms,"Purpose: Architecture is classified as one of the creative industries worldwide. However, it is plagued with a number of problems that confine its creativity towards developing innovative solutions that fulfil society needs. One of these pressing problems is the lack of creativity due to the non-utilisation of talented architects. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of lean talent management (LTM) as a novel approach to increase creativity in architectural design firms (ADFs). Design/methodology/approach: In order to achieve the above-mentioned aim, a mixed qualitative and quantitative methodology is designed to accomplish three objectives. First, reviewing literature to investigate the concepts of creative industries, motivation, demotivation, talent management (TM), talents utilisation (TU), lean thinking (LT) and lean innovation (LI). Second, presenting and analysing five case studies to explore the integration between TM, LT and LI in real-life context to overcome barriers of creativity. Finally, analysing the results of a survey questionnaire conducted with a representative sample of Egyptian ADFs to evaluate their perception and application of TM as a facilitator for creativity. Findings: The five barriers of creativity encompassed lack of motivation in ADFs and demotivation and lack of TU in ADFs and Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. TM facilitated motivation and eliminated six demotivating factors. The seventh factor was eliminated through LT. In AEC industry, TU was achieved through LI with five considerations. In ADFs, TU can be achieved through LTM. However, two additional barriers have been identified for further investigation. Egyptian ADFs failed increasing creativity with TM solely. Hence, a LTM framework is required. Research limitations/implications: Although the study focussed on architecture as a case for creative industries and targeted Egyptian ADFs, the application of LTM is to be applied at any industry that is talent-based although barriers related to the design process could vary. Originality/value: This paper presents an innovative approach through discussing the integration of lean concepts into TM towards increasing creativity in ADFs. This ideology has received scant attention in construction literature and is the first of its kind in the architectural field. The proposed ideas represent a synthesis that is novel and creative in thought and adds value to the knowledge in a manner that has not previously occurred.",Othman A.; Khalil M.,Journal,"Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management",2018-10-19,Faculty of Engineering,Architecture ;  Design ;  Innovation ;  Integrated practice ;  Knowledge management ;  Novel method
University faculty’s perceptions and practices of student centered learning in Qatar: Alignment or gap?,"Purpose: Although student-centered learning (SCL) has been encouraged for decades in higher education, to what level instructors are practicing SCL strategies remains in question. The purpose of this paper is to investigate a university faculty’s understanding and perceptions of SCL, along with current instructional practices in Qatar. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-method research design was employed including quantitative data from a survey of faculty reporting their current instructional practices and qualitative data on how these instructors define SCL and perceive their current practices via interviews with 12 instructors. Participants of the study are mainly from science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) field. Findings: Study results show that these instructors have rather inclusive definitions of SCL, which range from lectures to student interactions via problem-based teamwork. However, a gap between the instructors’ perceptions and their actual practices was identified. Although student activities are generally perceived as effective teaching strategies, the interactions observed were mainly in the form of student–content or student-teacher, while student–student interactions were limited. Prevailing assessment methods are summative, while formative assessment is rarely practiced. Faculty attributed this lack of alignment between how SCL could and should be practiced and the reality to external factors, including students’ lack of maturity and motivation due to the Middle Eastern culture, and institutional constraints such as class time and size. Research limitations/implications: The study is limited in a few ways. First regarding methodological justification the data methods chosen in this study were mainly focused on the faculty’s self-reporting. Second the limited number of participants restricts this study’s generalizability because the survey was administered in a volunteer-based manner and the limited number of interview participants makes it difficult to establish clear patterns. Third, researching faculty members raises concerns in the given context wherein extensive faculty assessments are regularly conducted. Practical implications: A list of recommendations is provided here as inspiration for institutional support and faculty development activities. First, faculty need deep understanding of SCL through experiences as learners so that they can become true believers and implementers. Second, autonomy is needed for faculty to adopt appropriate assessment methods that are aligned with their pedagogical objectives and delivery methods. Input on how faculty can adapt instructional innovation to tailor it to the local context is very important for its long-term effectiveness (Hora and Ferrare, 2014). Third, an inclusive approach to faculty evaluation by encouraging faculty from STEM backgrounds to be engaged in research on their instructional practice will not only sustain the practice of innovative pedagogy but will also enrich the research profiles of STEM faculty and their institutes. Social implications: The faculty’s understanding and perceptions of implementing student-centered approaches were closely linked to their prior experiences – experiencing SCL as a learner may better shape the understanding and guide the practice of SCL as an instructor. Originality/value: SCL is not a new topic; however, the reality of its practice is constrained to certain social and cultural contexts. This study contributes with original and valuable insights into the gap between ideology and reality in implementation of SCL in a Middle Eastern context.",Sabah S.; Du X.,Journal,Journal of Applied Research in Higher Education,2018-10-17,College of Education;Hashemite University;Aalborg University,Assessment ;  Instructional practices ;  Qatar ;  STEM faculty ;  Student-centered learning
Societal impact of university innovation,"Purpose: This study aims to use university patent and regional economic data to investigate the current and future impact of university innovation, measured using multiple variables, on real economic productivity. Design/methodology/approach: Using university patent and regional economic data, regression models are built to determine the impact of university innovation on current and future regional economic performance. Findings: The findings demonstrate that university innovation generates sustained impact on economic performance, but by itself, is insufficient in driving economic performance; and different measures of university innovation have different degrees of impact. University innovation makes up a small, albeit significant, proportion of the drivers of economic performance. Research limitations/implications: There are four implications. First, developing countries can leverage university–industry collaborations for economic growth. Second, innovation management must encourage continuous university innovation for sustainable economic productivity. Third, Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and non-STEM innovation warrant attention. Fourth, successful innovation policies should be tailored to their unique societal contexts. Originality/value: Although innovation is a driver of economic performance, there is a lack of studies that focus specifically on universities, operationalize performance using gross domestic product measures and take into account impact lags by exploring universities’ current and future impacts.",Yeo B.,Journal,Management Research Review,2018-10-17,DePaul University,Economic productivity ;  Information and knowledge management ;  Innovation policy ;  Licensing ;  Patents ;  Start-up companies ;  University innovation
Windings design for single-phase induction motors base on 4-phase induction motor (Case study: Identical windings design),"A 1-phase induction motor usually has a complicated windings design which compares to polyphase induction motor. In addition, a large capacitor start is required to operate the motor. It is an expensive way to operate the motor if it compare to polyphase induction motor. So, a new innovation method is required to make the motor more simple and cheaper. This research is purposed to study a new winding design for a single-phase capacitor motor. Winding design of the motor was conducted to a simple winding design like a 4-phase induction motor that has four identical windings. The comparator motor that use in this study was a Three-phase induction motor with data 1400 RPM, 1.5 HP, 50Hz, 380/220V, Y/Δ, 2.74/4.7A, 4 poles, that had the same current rating which the proposed method. The result showed that the motor design on this proposed method could be operated at 88.18 % power rating with power factor close to unity.",Anthony Z.; Erhaneli E.; Zulkarnaini Z.,Conference Proceeding,MATEC Web of Conferences,2018-10-16,Institute of Technology Padang,
Literature review on relationship building for community-academic collaboration in health research and innovation,"In response to European Commission Horizon 2020's call for 'science-for-and-with-community', scholars have recognized the need to conduct 'responsible research and innovation' and engage more with communities to combat today's complex health challenges. Hence, higher priority has been placed to cooperate with communities in health research and innovation development to better match societal values, needs and expectations. Accordingly, the approach of community-based participatory research (CBPR), the 'gold standard' within the community-engaged research spectrum, is the most widely discussed. However, it is seldom achieved in reality, as it requires establishment and maintenance of open, transparent, trustful and ongoing relationships between community partners and academia to succeed. Paradoxically, despite of the significance of quality collaborative relationship to the quality and success of community-academic collaboration, the key elements to achieve it were seldom discussed.Herein, the literature review aimed to (1) discuss the previous experiences and challenges in building and sustaining community-academic collaborative relationships; (2) examine the relationship building strategies for quality collaborative relationships; and (3) identify the potential research gaps for future research.Focusing on the area of health research and innovation, peer-reviewed articles, books and grey literature related to building and sustaining relationships in community-academic collaboration published between 1998 and 2018 were identified using the Web of Science, PubMed and Google Scholar bibliographic databases and Google search engine. Literature available in full-texts and English language with a focus on relationship aspects of community-academic collaboration were examined. Previous literature suggested thatacademics and community members encountered common challenges in experiencing inequitable relationships, distrust, divide between academia and community, uncommon norms of power sharing, dissemination of results and lack of resources for maintaining long-term relationships. Two approaches of relationship building: (1) personal qualities and competence, and (2) actions for relationship building from the beginning to the end stages of collaborative relationship were discussed. Literature revealed that the ways that academics approach, collaborate, communicate with and maintain in the community had significant impact on both current and future collaborative relationships. In addition, academics differed in acceptance and readiness towards community engagement, which could be attributed to the differences in personal qualities and competence. Future research should target on identifying the factors contributing to such individual differences and compare its impact on the quality of relationship with community, so as to better cultivate individuals' readiness and capacity towards community engagement and effective relationship building with community.",Chak C.,Conference Proceeding,MATEC Web of Conferences,2018-10-16,Science-to-Business Marketing Research Centre FH,Community-Academic Collaboration ;  Health ;  Literature Review ;  Relationship Building ;  Responsible Research and Innovation
Collective intellectual right? A case on protected geography indicated,"Many literature in the collaboration of innovation have suggested inventors should avoid the join ownership of intellectual property. However, in a special case the intellectual right can be assigned to a product. Our paper addresses the issues and challenges of shared intellectual right in the context of Protected Geography Indicated (PGI). The PGI recognizes such products based on their originality (in term of geography), not based on who have been invented them. This highlights that the right is belong to a community, not to individuals. In practice, this is problematic in which individuals in a community may or able to claim the right on the product. To illustrate how policy makers in developing country deal with this situation, we use secondary data from Indonesian Agency on Intellectual Property and case studies on indigenous food products. We approached the cases using theory of resolving potential conflict in community. The discussion in our contribution is taking aim at identifying of problems of which may be occurred during the process of Intellectual Right application. Further, we propose recommendations for individual, communal, and policy levels to resolve potential problems in the future.",David F.; David W.,Conference Proceeding,MATEC Web of Conferences,2018-10-16,Institute of Technology Padang;Universitas Bakrie,
Absorptive capacity in low-tech industry: Case Study of Indonesian Manufacturing Companies,"Innovation has widely recognized as an important factor for driving competitiveness of many firms. In order to generate innovative performances, firms need to improve their capabilities in absorbing knowledge and technology from external sources, which is so called absorptive capacity. This paper will analyze what kind of sources of innovation in manufacturing sectors especially for low tech industries. Focusing on innovation activities, this paper aims to identify what kind of determinants in influencing the difference of absorptive capacity in low tech industries. The source of data is derived from Innovation Survey 2011 held by Center for Science and Technology Development Studies. The survey conducted for 1360 firms in manufacturing sector, in which most of the distribution is mainly consisted of low technology sectors. Instead of quantitative approach, the result is also supported by in depth interview from selected firms observed in 2013. This paper addresses multiple case studies as the qualitative approach, including firms in food and beverages, and jewelry art and design. According to the results, most of low tech companies searched their external sources of knowledge from their market, and customers were the main driver for their innovation output. In respond to this situation, this paper proposes an idea of open innovation for enhancing industrial competitiveness. As policy insights, the sources of competitive advantage in an open innovation setting will encourage the firm to the internal organizational processes that allow a firm to recognize, assimilate and exploit knowledge.",Ariana L.; Asmara I.,Conference Proceeding,MATEC Web of Conferences,2018-10-16,Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia,Absorptive capacity ;  Companies ;  Low tech ;  Manufacturing ;  Source of innovation

Acceleration of the cycle of extended reproduction of the active part of fixed assets in construction,"One of the main reasons hindering the scientific and technological development of construction and the national economy as a whole is the mismatch of the cycles of expanded reproduction of the active part of fixed assets in construction as the basic cycles of the development of construction. The renovation of the active part of the fixed assets of construction organizations in the conditions of shrinking the investment base of construction is very slow, and, as a result, there is no timely provision of construction work with the new high-performance construction equipment and vehicles. Financial leasing, as world experience shows, is an effective tool for updating the fixed assets of construction organizations, but its share is too small in the total volume of investments in the active part of fixed assets in construction. There is a need to develop new mechanisms that would ensure synchronization of the basic cycles of development in construction and contribute to the development of leasing technologies in the construction sector. As a result of scientific research, a new mechanism for accelerating the cycles of expanded reproduction of the active part of the fixed assets in construction was developed. It is titled ""innovative leasing engineering,"" which allows to synchronize them with construction and investment cycles, contributes to increasing the volume of financial leasing in construction, and also provides timely support and capacity of strengthening the innovation wave in construction, eventually contributing to the accelerated transition of the investment and construction complex, as well as the national economy as a whole, to a new technological order.",Alekseeva T.,Conference Proceeding,MATEC Web of Conferences,2018-10-15,Moscow State University of Civil Engineering,
Resource utilization for sustainability enhancement in Japanese industries,"Recently, many studies have applied environmental assessment based upon data envelopment analysis to measure the performance of various organizations. An important feature of the approach is that it evaluates their economic activities which use inputs to produce desirable (e.g., electricity) and undesirable (e.g., CO2 emission) outputs. To document the practicality, this study discusses the corporate sustainability of Japanese industries. In the application, we need to overcome the three methodological difficulties related to the approach at the initial stage: how to handle zero and/or negative values, how to unify inputs, desirable, and undesirable outputs within a synchronized framework, and how to identify a possible occurrence of a production limit and to identify that of green technology innovation. This study obtains the three empirical findings. First, Japanese firms put more strategic weights on their operational achievements than environmental ones. Second, manufacturing firms outperform non-manufacturing ones, including services, energy utilities and information technology industries, in their operations. Finally, the production limit may occur in most industries under current business surroundings. However, they may overcome the difficulty by investing for production or service assets and green technology. The empirical results are consistent with the current Japanese industrial policy, or so-called “Abenomics,” which centers upon the performance improvement in non-manufacturing industries. We also discuss a significant potential of green technology innovation that the Japanese government does not consider in the current policy agendas.",Sueyoshi T.; Goto M.,Journal,Applied Energy,2018-10-15,Institute of Science Tokyo;New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology,Corporate Sustainability ;  Data envelopment analysis ;  Environmental assessment ;  Japanese industries
Developing competencies to lead innovation in Indian manufacturing: an education model,"Purpose: This paper aims to explore the implementation of an innovation in an executive education programme in the context of the Indian manufacturing industry. This paper presents an understanding of a conceptual framework for delivering a unique manufacturing leadership programme, explaining the different linkages between government, industry and academia for changing the mindset of participants and growth of a nation by developing highly skilful employees to lead India’s manufacturing industry. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reports a single case study of an innovative manufacturing leadership development programme. Primary data were obtained from focus group studies and interviews. Documentary evidence in the form of reports, student work, course curriculum and meeting minutes was studied. The individual participants in the programme are used as units of analysis to explore systems of innovation, at individual levels. The analysis was carried out by applying theoretical models to explain the design, delivery and development of the programme over the years. Findings: The findings from this research are an exploration of factors for sustaining the value of a system of innovation with special focus on a subsystem of knowledge creation and competence building. Institutional change is found to be a key input to the innovation process in terms of a collaborative mindset between three different academic institutes well known in different areas of expertise. Building an innovative coordination mechanism and curriculum combining academics with practical learning helped in changing the mindset of the students and faculty of the programme. This is linked to the development of country through leadership development by mindset change in mentors and students. The findings show that the studied programme has grown in terms of creating demand (in the form of increased applicants), guaranteeing 100 per cent placement with an average 50 per cent increase in salary and accelerated career in terms of role in the organisation. This was possible through continuous improvement practices for making local changes to the programme from time to time and building a community of practice in collaboration with industry. Originality/value: The value of this research lies in highlighting the importance of international cooperation in speeding up the process of transferring management and technological knowledge from academia to industry. The framework developed for implementing a system of learning for creating a national system of innovation in manufacturing can be generalised to develop more such programmes in emerging nations for addressing skill challenges to lead future innovative projects.",Datta P.,Journal,International Journal of Innovation Science,2018-10-15,Indian Institute of Management Calcutta,Capability development ;  Case-based research ;  Executive education ;  Higher education ;  Manufacturing ;  Manufacturing education ;  System of innovation ;  Triple helix

Incorporating artistic thinking into sustainability,"Arts have great potential to facilitate sustainability. However, as a growing research field, it is still not clear how and what factors of arts can be applied to promote sustainable behavior. This paper summarizes five key factors of artistic thinking, including novelty, criticism, perfectionism, unique, and passion; each of them reveals clues to addressing sustainability issues. Meaningful examples are presented to demonstrate the proposed ideas, and the implications for researchers and practitioners are discussed. The results suggest that turning any form of art-making processes into service offerings can help companies work with their customers and co-create sustainable value with them. Artistic thinking also encourages hands-on programs and problem-based learning that benefit education for sustainability. To link artistic thinking to behavior change, more art-making and art learning programs for citizens and communities should be developed.",Chen C.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2018-10-10,Yuan Ze University,Arts ;  Behavior change ;  Creativity ;  Innovation ;  Sustainability education ;  Value co-creation
Defining nexus technology: The introduction of a conceptual model,"Technological innovations that are available, as well as those being developed, are becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, and in recent years technologies emerged that hold structural characteristics that are new, or different, from traditional technologies. These technologies, which are defined in this research inquiry, are referred to as a 'nexus technology'. A review of technology definitions, typologies, and modes of interaction between technologies is provided with the aim of identifying the similarities and differences between existing concepts and that of the nexus technology. The aim of this research inquiry is not to construct a new, or alternative, definition of technology, but rather to use existing bodies of literature and definitions to develop a conceptual model that can be used to define a nexus technology. A deeper understanding of nexus technology and its defining characteristics is required to grasp the challenges associated with a nexus technology when the design, development, implementation, management, innovation and related research issues of such technologies are considered. The primary aim of defining a nexus technology is to highlight the (unique) characteristics of this type of technology, in order to, from here, further the research and body of knowledge concerned with nexus technologies.",De Kock I.; Brent A.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 IEEE Technology and Engineering Management Conference, TEMSCON 2018",2018-10-09,Victoria University of Wellington;Stellenbosch University,Conceptual model ;  Nexus technology ;  Structural characteristics ;  Technology
Enriching innovation generation through external technology scouting in an uncertain technological environment,"Open search, especially external technology scouting, is commonly used by firms to achieve superior innovation outputs. Drawing on a knowledge-based perspective on open innovation, we introduce a new theoretical model, the external technology scouting model of innovation outputs, to explain how technology scouting and absorptive capability predict firms' innovation generation in an uncertain technological environment. Using a sample of 236 high-technology firms, we examine main, two-way and three-way interaction effects for measures of innovation generation. Overall, the results suggest that external technology scouting enhances innovation generation by improving the absorptive capability in an uncertain technological environment; these findings have notable managerial and research implications.",Wang C.; Quarr X.; Tsai M.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 IEEE Technology and Engineering Management Conference, TEMSCON 2018",2018-10-09,National Chiayi University;San Jose State University,Absorptive capability ;  Innovation generation ;  Open innovation ;  Technology scouting ;  Uncertain technology

On occupant behavior and innovation studies towards high performance buildings: A transdisciplinary approach,"With ever-increasing population and urbanization, it is crucial to decrease energy density in the built environmentwithout sacrificing occupants' comfort andwell-being. This requires consideration of technological developments along with the human factor in order to achieve environmental and social sustainability. Two major contributors to the development of conceptualizations for human-centric technologies are behavior and innovation (B & I) studies. Behavior studies aims to explain individualistic or society-based dynamics of human behavior whereas the innovation studies focuses on social, economic, organizational, and regulatory dimensions and processes of inventive activity. If these studies are incorporated into the hardcore architecture and engineering disciplines with a transdisciplinary approach, the orchestration of occupant behavior and the innovative technologies would be possible, which in turn significantly enhance the comfort and energy efficiency in built environments. This paper aims to provide an overview of interdisciplinary dialog between B & I studies and underlines the role of their collaboration to leverage transdisciplinary research on human-building interaction for energy efficiency. The approach presented here is structured as a conceptual framework and named the 'socio-technical core' (STC). STC is to lead to more organic articulation of energy efficiency innovations with real life and pave the way for higher level of acceptance. In order to have a 'big-picture' for the well-accepted conceptualizations and the current status of interdisciplinary dialog, we provide a review of (B & I) theories and models along with network analysis of key concepts. Then we investigate the potential directions of future transdisciplinary efforts by discussing the influences of B & I studies to each other for application to energy efficiency studies. In order to put the analysis in a firm background, we provide a case study for thermostat, which can be considered as a product improved with B & I approaches during last decades. We also discuss the benefits of B & I based transdisciplinary research perspective by referring to few examples in literature and the points emerged in this study.",Keskin C.; Mengüç M.,Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2018-10-06,Özyeğin Üniversitesi,Behavior ;  Energy efficiency ;  High performance buildings ;  Human factor ;  Innovation ;  Network analysis ;  Smart thermostats ;  Socio-technical ;  Technology acceptance ;  Transdisciplinary

Analysis on technology convergence mechanism using weighted gene co-expression network,"Technology convergence is a hot research topic within a challenging field. It is of great significance to analyze the fusion mechanism and mine the key technologies that affect technology convergence, which can guide the development of technology fusion and improve the independent innovation capability of enterprises. It is a novel idea to introduce genetic engineering into the process of technological innovation and convergence as the similar recombination process they both have. In this study, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), which is based on the similarity measure of a topological overlap structure, was utilized in the analysis of the International Patent Classification (IPC) of patents. In this analysis, the gene with a high correlation was identified as a 'technical gene module' using the dynamic tree cut algorithm. Furthermore, hub technology genes, which are highly related to technology fusion and have high connectivity in the module, could be obtained.

How innovation strategies affect the role of openness under knowledge spillovers?,"The current study testified the impact of enterprises' innovation openness on their innovative capacity. Drawing on dual-process model, we suggested that enterprises with higher openness held a stronger innovative capacity and knowledge spillovers played a mediating role between openness and innovative capacity. We further proposed that firms might suffer a decline of innovativeness provided attaching excessive importance to exploitation rather than exploration. In order to examine our predictions, we used investigation data answered by middle or senior managers from 205 emerging enterprises in China, and then performed analyses by means of hierarchical regression. Consistent with supposed framework, we found that the effects of knowledge spillovers mediated the positive relationship between openness and innovative capacity. In addition, exploitative strategy negatively moderated the direct relationship between knowledge spillover effects and innovative capacity and the indirect relationship between openness and innovative capacity. Finally, the academic and practical implications of these findings as well as future research orientations are discussed.",Jiang Z.; Wang Z.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2018 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Managing Technological Entrepreneurship: The Engine for Economic Growth, Proceedings",2018-10-04,Huazhong University of Science and Technology,
A study of the factors influencing industry-academia collaboration activities in private universities,"It is imperative that industry-academia collaboration activities are implemented successfully to achieve open innovation, and such awareness has grown in recent years. Private companies and universities are organizations with very different purposes and characteristics; it is therefore generally difficult for them to cooperate with each other. We focused on industry-academia collaboration activities and factors influencing them in private universities. This study aims to reveal which factors influence industry-academia collaboration activities in private universities and to what extent. Based on the case of Japanese private universities, the data on industry-academia collaboration activities and candidates for influencing factors of 136 private universities, including 62 private universities with engineering faculties, were collected, and individual and comprehensive relationships were analyzed. As a result, the positive factors influencing the 136 universities and 62 universities were identified as follows: Number of graduate students, and number of research papers or amount for grants-in-aid for scientific research. On the other hand, the negative factor influencing the 62 universities was number of undergraduate students. Consequently, it is necessary to expand graduate schools, reinforce basic research, and increase the number of researchers corresponding to the number of undergraduate students. We hope these results are useful for considering university management and for planning policy measures.",Yamaguchi Y.; Fujimoto J.; Yamazaki A.; Koshiyama T.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2018 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Managing Technological Entrepreneurship: The Engine for Economic Growth, Proceedings",2018-10-04,Chiba Institute of Technology,

"Grassroots opportunities for innovation, technology, and entrepreneurship: Makerspaces in non-urban communities","A revolution has been underway in creating, innovating, and making things. The development of makerspaces is a 21st century development that is taking place-particularly in large urban locations-throughout the world. More recently, smaller/non-urban communities have witnessed the development of makerspaces as grassroots opportunities for innovation, technology and entrepreneurship. Makerspaces are viewed as setting the stage for economic growth and creative capital development for decades to come. To date, most research has focused on makerspaces in urban settings. This exploratory study extends our knowledge of makerspaces located in small-medium sized/non-urban communities. We found the seeds of true 'grassroots' innovation, technology and entrepreneurship are being initiated in the context of small to medium sized and rural communities in the Province of Ontario Canada.1 The study addresses four questions. (1) Where are non-urban makerspaces located geographically? (2) What types of maker platforms are used? (3) What are the organizational and structural characteristics of these makerspaces? (4) Are these grassroots makerspaces a reflection of a local community's entrepreneurial ecosystem?

A process model integrated to innovation management tools to support technology entrepreneurship,"Technology entrepreneurship (TE) has gaining increasing importance over the last decades. Therefore, a multidisciplinary research field was formed around research on technology-based innovation and entrepreneurship. However, despite the managerial and technological skills required in the challenge of new venture creation and development, little attention has been paid to the product/service and business levels of analysis of this phenomenon. An in-depth longitudinal study was conducted with four startups along 27 months. It was based on technology entrepreneurship, innovation management and new product development literatures. This research proposes a seven-step process model integrated to innovation management tools to support entrepreneurs in the context of startup creation and development. And then some theoretical and practical aspects of the proposed model are discussed. In particular the paper brings concerns on how the process and integrated tools helped TE management, how they were created and adapted to the startup context throughout the research, and which were the real contributions and limitations of well-known approaches, such as Lean Startup and other tools and processes.",Souza M.; Filho L.; Bagno R.; Souza W.; Cheng L.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2018 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Managing Technological Entrepreneurship: The Engine for Economic Growth, Proceedings",2018-10-04,Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Minas Gerais;Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais;New Ventures Creation Dept.,

A technological return to originating firms from knowledge spillovers: A new strategic tool or an unintentional side effect?,"This paper empirically examines one of the benefits of outbound technology; i.e., technological returns to originating firms which revealed, licensed, or simply spilled over their technologies. Most open technological innovation literature has focused on inbound innovation, with few papers mentioning the value of outbound technological innovation. These papers found the phenomena of learning-by-exposure or recipient-guided unfamiliar knowledge exploration, which entails technological learning by an original technology holder from those who had learned from the originator. Although this discovery is unique, they left one question: Can outbound technology be used as a strategic tool to learn from technological alliance partners? We examined this by using patents from 114 research consortia with the assumption that citations of patents with certain time-lags represent knowledge flows between two parties. We analyzed 913 backward and forward citation pairs that share the same applicant. Our quantitative test illustrates the positive effect of technological knowledge spillovers and subsequent absorption of the focal technology. Patents indirectly citing patents from originating firms via patents from others show significantly high technological value; however, this effect is only observed in spillovers to third parties of research consortia. In other words, recipient-guided exploration is an almost-uncontrollable side effect. At the same time, our analysis revealed that knowledge spillovers are not always negative for originating firms.",Yoshioka-Kobayashi T.; Watanabe T.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2018 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Managing Technological Entrepreneurship: The Engine for Economic Growth, Proceedings",2018-10-04,The University of Tokyo;Hitotsubashi University,
The praxis of stupidity: an explanation to understand the barriers mitigating rework in construction,"The practice of ‘functional stupidity’ forms the essence of Alvesson and Spicer’s ‘Stupidity-based theory of organisations’. Functional stupidity is an incapacity and/or disinclination on the part of organisational members to exercise critical reflection about what they are doing, to understand why they are doing it, and determine what the consequences of their activities are beyond the immediate task at hand. Drawing on the authors’ empirical research with regard to the nature of rework causation, we have observed that there is a proclivity for functional stupidity to reside in everyday practice in construction. We noticed that functional stupidity was a recurring organisational issue explicitly linked to ‘power and politics’ that was played out in numerous construction projects. In these projects managers attempted to discourage critical reflection that called into question prevailing organisational norms and values that had been sanctioned under the auspices of a ‘zero-vision’. In some instances, this, in turn, led to reinforcing ‘stupidity self-management’ behaviour whereby employees intentionally limited their own critical reflection creating a vicious zone of zemblanity that kept being played out in projects. The corollaries in this instance being an inability to learn, engender innovation, and improve organisational and project performance.",Love P.; Smith J.; Ackermann F.; Irani Z.,Journal,Production Planning and Control,2018-10-03,Bond University;Curtin University;University of Bradford,Communicative action ;  construction ;  critical thinking ;  functional stupidity ;  rework
Local Gaussian Process Model for Large-Scale Dynamic Computer Experiments,"The recent accelerated growth in the computing power has generated popularization of experimentation with dynamic computer models in various physical and engineering applications. Despite the extensive statistical research in computer experiments, most of the focus had been on the theoretical and algorithmic innovations for the design and analysis of computer models with scalar responses. In this article, we propose a computationally efficient statistical emulator for a large-scale dynamic computer simulator (i.e., simulator which gives time series outputs). The main idea is to first find a good local neighborhood for every input location, and then emulate the simulator output via a singular value decomposition (SVD) based Gaussian process (GP) model. We develop a new design criterion for sequentially finding this local neighborhood set of training points. Several test functions and a real-life application have been used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach over a naive method of choosing local neighborhood set using the Euclidean distance among design points. The supplementary material, which contains proof of the theoretical results, detailed algorithms, additional simulation results, and R codes, are available online.",Zhang R.; Lin C.; Ranjan P.,Journal,Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics,2018-10-02,Indian Institute of Management Indore;Queen’s University,Nearest neighbor ;  Sequential design ;  Singular value decomposition ;  Statistical emulator ;  Time series output
The role of knowledge-intense high-impact firms in city innovation systems,"Past studies on city innovation systems acknowledge the important role of firms, but rarely study them explicitly. This paper shifts attention to the firm level, and proposes that knowledge-intensive high-impact firms are especially important in shaping the economic development of local economies by creating industry-specific micro pathways. This argument follows from their central role in city innovation systems: we propose that knowledge-intense high-impact firms (KIHIFs) have a relatively high absorptive capacity and therefore make better use of knowledge spillover, but also play a role in distributing international knowledge spillover in return. To empirically investigate this thesis, we examine firms operating in the computer-programming activities, and engineering and technical consultancy industries in the capital area surrounding Helsinki, Finland. In line with our theoretical arguments, we find that the relative within-industry concentrations and rates of internationalisation of KIHIFs vary greatly over small geographic distances. Future research and implications for policy-makers are discussed.",Burström T.; Peltonen J.,Journal,Innovation: Organization and Management,2018-10-02,Hanken - Svenska handelshögskolan,absorptive capacity ;  City innovation systems ;  high-impact firms ;  knowledge intensive ;  knowledge spillover ;  pathway

Bionic design of turbocharger volute based on spiral shells Neverita didyma improving turbine performance,"The performance of the supercharger volute directly affects the overall efficiency and capability of the turbocharger. It is important to improve the efficiency and performance of the turbocharger by reducing the flow resistance and decreasing the energy loss of the volute. Many measures are taken to improve the efficiency of the volute. Ocean spiral shells have evolved to reduce fluid resistance and cut down fluid energy loss during motion. In this paper, the spiral shell was taken as the biomimetic prototype, and the cavity data of the spiral shells were obtained by reverse engineering technology. The internal cavity cross-section data of shells were extracted in the range of 270 degrees. After the cross-section curves were optimized, they were taken as the section curves to construct the bionic volute. And then the volute bionic surface design was realized. The computational models of the prototype and bionic supercharger were finished. Taking the turbocharger volute of the gasoline engine with 1.5-liter displacement as the research object, the numerical analysis method was used to realize the performance difference between the bionic volute and the prototype volute. First, the prototype numerical model's reliability was verified. Then the bionic volute was matched with the prototype turbine system. The numerical simulation of the bionic volute and the prototype volute was carried out in the range of common working conditions, and the difference between the two was explored from the microscopic flow field. During the modeling process, the A/R values of the two turbine volutes were the same, and the outlet width of the volute was consistent with the outlet diameter. The verification test was carried out on a QYZ-2 turbocharger test bench. The inlet flow of the compressor was measured by a double-line flowmeter, and the maximum measurement error was less than 2% FS. Both the inlet and the outlet of the compressor were provided with a pressure sensor and a temperature sensor. The turbine inlet was provided with a turbine inlet pressure sensor and an intake temperature sensor, and the turbine outlet had a turbine exhaust pressure sensor and an exhaust temperature sensor in the extension duct. The maximum error of the pressure sensor was less than 2.5% FS, and the maximum error of the temperature sensor was less than 3% FS. The maximum error of the simulation calculation was within the allowable range. The simulation results showed that the simulation model was in good agreement with the test bench, and has good reliability. Therefore, the numerical model can meet the requirements of subsequent research. In the simulation, 12×104, 16×104 and 20×104 r/min were selected to represent the low, medium and high operation speed of turbine respectively. The evaluation parameters included turbine efficiency, flow characteristics and total volute loss coefficient. The results showed that the turbine flow capacity increases with the increase of the expansion ratio increase. And the turbine flow characteristics of the two volutes were basically the same. The results showed that the turbine efficiency can be increased by 3% and by up to 5% under the condition of keeping the same turbine flow capacity matching two volutes. The flow field analysis results showed that the bionic optimization volute reduces the flow loss near the inner surface of the volute and the airflow friction in the flow channel. And the flow resistance was small, the whole flow in the bionic volute was smooth and uniform, and there was no swirling flow. Therefore, the turbine efficiency can be significantly improved. The bionic design method used in this paper had a significant improvement on turbocharger turbine performance, and can provide reference and method innovation for the design and optimization of automotive and agricultural machinery turbocharging systems.",Wu N.; Zhang K.; Wang X.; Ma Y.,Journal,Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering,2018-10-01,Shandong Jiaotong University;Jilin University,Bionic ;  Design ;  Experiments ;  Flow capacity ;  Spiral shells ;  Turbine efficiency ;  Turbine volute
Networking research — A reflection in the middle years,"Networking is no longer a new area of computer science and engineering – it has matured as a discipline and the major infrastructure it supports, the Internet, is long past being primarily a research artifact. I believe that we should consider ourselves as the civil engineers of the Internet, primarily helping to understand and improve a vast and critical infrastructure. This implies that implementing changes takes decades, not conference cycles, and that implementation is largely driven by compatibility with existing infrastructure and considerations of cost effectiveness, where resources that research focuses on, such as bandwidth and compute cycles, often play a much smaller role than limited organizational capacity for change. Telecommunications carriers, in particular, have become akin to airlines, largely operating equipment designed by others, with emphasis on marketing, not innovation. Even more than in other engineering disciplines, standards matter, whether set by standards bodies or dominant players. Given the multi-year time frames of standards and the limited willingness of national funding bodies to support standardization work, this makes research impact harder, as does the increasing complexity of cellular networks and barriers to entry that shut out most researchers from contributing to large parts of commercial mobile networks.",Schulzrinne H.,Journal,Computer Communications,2018-10-01,Columbia University,

The Double Channel Synergy of Motivation in Predicting Entrepreneur's Creativity and Firm Innovation,"In this research, the role of motivational impact on entrepreneur's creativity and the following startup innovation was discussed and examined. Drawing on the componential model of creativity (Amabile, 1983, 1988, 1996) and the motivated information processing in group model (MIP-G model; De Dreu et al., 2008a, 2008b), I proposed that creativity is influenced by intrinsic motivation, prosocial motivation and furthermore, motivational synergy through these two channels. In the internal channel, intrinsic motivation is critical for creativity by promoting »the individual's positive reaction to qualities of the task itself» (Amabile, 1996, p. 115). In the external channel, however, taking social information processes (Salancik, Pfeffer, 1978) as a driving force, the minority dissent will influence the team by producing individual creativity (De Dreu et al., 2008a; 2008b) and improving group performance (Gong et al., 2013) when the members have high prosocial motivation. Under the interaction of internal channel and external channel, the intrinsic motivation will enhance the impact of prosocial motivation on individual creativity. Hypotheses were proposed based on the theoretical framework and tested according to the evidence from organizational field research. Implications for motivation as driving force of creativity are discussed.",Qu G.,Conference Proceeding,TEMS-ISIE 2018 - 1st Annual International Symposium on Innovation and Entrepreneurship of the IEEE Technology and Engineering Management Society,2018-10-01,Tsinghua University,firm innovation ;  individual creativity ;  intrinsic motivation ;  Prosocial motivation

Open Source Platforms and Frameworks for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning,"In recent years Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have emerged from academic labs and become prominent drivers of innovation in the high-tech industry. The number of jobs in this area has rapidly increased along with research output from industry and the commercialization of that research. It is widely accepted that the changes resulting from these advances will shape society. Diversity in these fields must be increased not only to get people from underrepresented populations into these lucrative jobs but also to have a positive impact by expecting that a more diverse workforce will ensure the fairness of data-driven decisions made by AI and ML algorithms, an issue that has come under scrutiny. The work described here is a result of ongoing efforts to modernize AI and ML courses, and to make its techniques an integral part of the software engineering capstone course at our educational institutions. We report on how the courses and the practice of software engineering have adopted cloud based platforms where we gain the benefit of creating virtual machines and containers for necessary software stacks, the pedagogical benefits of using open-source software that enable blending of markup text, code and output from code within the same document. Information about the choice of software libraries to help students produce code and perform experiments on data at an early stage is an important topic that is included in the discussion. We list of examples of where we have leveraged existing student interest in application of AI and ML, to motivate the work on projects.

Game research on process conflicts under the bounded rationality of science and technology innovation team members,"Due to the difference of individuals in the team of science and technology innovation, team members are prone to team process conflict due to the differences in tasks and team goals. Based on the moderating effect of process conflict on team collaboration, this paper constructs a process conflict evolutionary game model that focuses on the self-interest of members of S&T team and analyzes the evolutionary stability of the strategy (keeping proper process conflict). The results show that when the net income of team members choosing conflict is greater than the excess return of choosing cooperation, the team members will gradually produce destructive conflict (non-cooperation) in the process of long-term evolutionary learning; the net income of team members choosing conflict is less than the choice during the long-term evolutionary learning process of members, due to the limited rationality of the team members, they can not achieve full cooperation with each other through the learning ability of the members of the game. However, by influencing the team members in the outcome of the evolutionary game, strategic choice of the key parameters of the adjustment, you can gradually generate constructive conflicts, so that the team members to maintain the purpose of cooperation with each other.",Wan T.; Otsuki H.,Journal,Xitong Gongcheng Lilun yu Shijian/System Engineering Theory and Practice,2018-10-01,Xi'an Technological University;Waseda University,Bounded rationality ;  Evolutionary game ;  Process conflict ;  Stable strategy ;  Team members
Participatory Design of Portable and Adaptable Furniture Product for Village Traditional Pastry Vendors in Surabaya,"Traditional pastry making is an authentic skill and source of livelihood for many village vendors in Indonesia. Despite their potentials in improving regional economy and promoting traditional cuisine, village pastry vendors face marketing problems due to their poor product display system, lack of retail space, and uncertainty of available time to make and sell their pastries. This research develops the idea of designing a portable and adaptable furniture product that can help pastry makers display and sell pastries efficiently and independently. Using the participatory method of human-centred design, the designers became participants of the pastry-making community in order to empathize with their problems and aspirations. Meanwhile, the pastry makers became participants in the following design processes of defining problems, ideating concepts and testing of furniture design prototypes. The result of this research is a furniture product for displaying and selling traditional pastries that is movable, adaptable to space and place, visually representable to the natural authentic image of Indonesian traditional cuisine, could be assembled and dissembled easily, and practical for storage and mobility. From the participatory design method, product designers also gain a reflexive awareness of their role in the society as agents of social change and economic innovations.",Thamrin D.; Mulyono G.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2018-10-01,Universitas Kristen Petra,
3D/2D multidimensional perovskites: Balance of high performance and stability for perovskite solar cells,"The power conversion efficiency achieved in three-dimensional (3D) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is already competitive with that of commercial silicon solar cells. Achieving long-term stability under operation conditions is critical for reaching market success for PSC applications. Despite impressive progress over the past few years on fundamental understandings and technical innovations for improving PSC stability, the stability of PSCs against moisture/heat/light is still a key focus of research efforts for PSC development. Recent studies suggest that the long hydrophobic organic spacer in two-dimensional (2D) perovskites is helpful to improve perovskite stability, but 2D perovskites seem limited on obtaining high-performance solar cells due to its wide optical bandgaps and limited charge transport. To overcome this challenge, 3D/2D multidimensional perovskites—with an intermediate dimensionality between 3D and 2D—has recently emerged as a potential candidate to simultaneously maintain long-term stability and high performance. In this review, we first present a detailed discussion of the structure of 3D/2D multidimensional perovskites and their unique properties. Second, we discuss the stability of 3D/2D multidimensional perovskite and 2D perovskite as interface engineering layer-based solar cells. Finally, we summarize and outline the perspectives toward high-performance 3D/2D multidimensional perovskite-based solar cells.",Zhang F.; Kim D.; Zhu K.,Journal,Current Opinion in Electrochemistry,2018-10-01,National Renewable Energy Laboratory,
Recombinant Service Systems Engineering,"Although many methods have been proposed for engineering service systems and customer solutions, most of these approaches give little consideration to recombinant service innovation. Recombinant innovation refers to reusing and integrating resources that were previously unconnected. In an age of networked products and data, we can expect that many service innovations will be based on adding, dissociating, and associating existing value propositions by accessing internal and external resources instead of designing them from scratch. The purpose of this paper is to identify if current service engineering approaches account for the mechanisms of recombinant innovation and to design a method for recombinant service systems engineering. In a conceptual analysis of 24 service engineering methods, the study identified that most methods (1) focus on designing value propositions instead of service systems, (2) view service independent of physical goods, (3) are either linear or iterative instead of agile, and (4) do not sufficiently address the mechanisms of recombinant innovation. The paper discusses how these deficiencies can be remedied and designs a revised service systems engineering approach that reorganizes service engineering processes according to four design principles. The method is demonstrated with the recombinant design of a service system for predictive maintenance of agricultural machines.",Beverungen D.; Lüttenberg H.; Wolf V.,Journal,Business and Information Systems Engineering,2018-10-01,Paderborn University,(Product-)service system ;  Design science research ;  New service development ;  Recombinant innovation ;  Service engineering
Designing Interiors to Mitigate Physical and Cognitive Deficits Related to Aging and to Promote Longevity in Older Adults: A Review,"Background: With the increasing global population of older adults, there is a need for environmental interventions that directly affect their physical, psychological, and emotional well-being to help them maintain or regain their independence and autonomy - all of which promote longevity. Methods: To better understand potential opportunities and challenges associated with interior design and ""future homes"" that may promote well-being, aging in place, and independent living in older adults, the authors reviewed relevant literature and included their own expert opinions from a multidisciplinary point of view including interior design, wellness, and engineering. Results: After summarizing existing environmental interventions for the aging population and their effectiveness, this review reveals knowledge gaps in interior design for the well-being and longevity of older adults followed by a discussion of opportunities for future research that may fill these gaps. Some of these opportunities include finding habilitative design strategies that identify and address unique situational needs of each user, advancing multidisciplinary fields such as environmental gerontology that recreate security and independence for older adults even outside of their homes, implementing technically advanced design strategies, which are flexible and adaptive to individual needs; and integrating the Internet of things (IoT) into living environments, including voice-activated command technologies to improve seniors' central role in enabling an optimized healthcare ecosystem. Conclusions: Knowledge of current evidence regarding the impact of different environmental factors may hasten adaptation of well-designed innovations that can provide optimal healing and living environments for the aging population. By effectively addressing older adults' unique and specialized needs, design practitioners can become an indispensable part of their medical, social, and environmental team. One of the rapidly developing infrastructures promising to revolutionize the design of ""future homes"" is the IoT. While it is at an early stage of development, ultimately we envisage a connected home using voice-controlled technology and Bluetooth-radio-connected add-ons, to augment much of what home health does today. Bringing these approaches together into an effective strategy for a model of effective geriatric care is important and needs to become an integral part of both design education and practice.",Engineer A.; Sternberg E.; Najafi B.,Journal,Gerontology,2018-10-01,The University of Arizona;Baylor College of Medicine,Aging ;  Daily life ;  Environment ;  Environmental factors ;  Environmental interventions ;  Interior design ;  Longevity ;  Well-being
Capacity predictions and capacity passenger car equivalents of platooning vehicles on basic segments,"Vehicle platooning is an innovative strategy that uses automated driving technology and communication to enable a more efficient use of transportation networks. By controlling tighter gaps between vehicles, vehicle platooning will increase freeway capacity. However, it is important to quantify the extent of the increase of capacity so that highway engineers can plan for this technology. This Federal Highway Administration research develops an analytical model to predict the capacity of basic freeway segments based on the market penetration and the maximum number of vehicles allowed in a platoon. It uses these predictions to calculate passenger car equivalents, which may be required for planning purposes. Simulations show that capacity can be predicted analytically to within 2% of simulated values. In addition, for the parameters used in the analysis, the capacity of freeways that restrict platoons to no more than 5 vehicles is comparable to the capacity of freeways that allow larger platoons (e.g., 6.1% maximum difference in capacity between maximum 5 and 12 vehicle platoons); consideration of limiting platoon size is important to ensure maneuverability.",Bujanovic P.; Lochrane T.,Journal,Journal of Transportation Engineering Part A: Systems,2018-10-01,Federal Highway Administration - Virginia Division;The University of Texas at Austin,Cooperative adaptive cruise control ;  Cooperative automation ;  Highway capacity manual ;  Passenger car equivalents ;  Platooning
Competitive Dialogue in Norwegian Public Infrastructure Projects,"Competitive dialogue (CD) is a relatively new procurement procedure introduced in 2004 by the European Parliament for particularly complex contracts. The Norwegian Public Roads Administration (NPRA) has limited experience with the procedure, but they are planning to use it in several future projects. Limited research was found concerning the practical issues of CD. This paper explores the experiences of Norwegian practitioners to identify such issues and suggests measures for the success of future projects using the procedure. In addition to a literature study, a document study and 22 semistructured in-depth interviews with key informants from six cases selected from the Norwegian public infrastructure projects were carried out. Both the client and the suppliers value the potential of CD. However, several challenges were identified, such as lack of practical experience with CD, ethical challenges, determining the most economically advantageous tender (MEAT) criteria, evaluation based on the MEAT criteria, and varying market interest. This paper contributes to construction engineering and management practice to increase the understanding of CD by suggesting what kinds of measures ought to be taken for the success of future projects using the procedure.",Wondimu P.; Lohne J.; Lædre O.,Journal,Journal of Construction Engineering and Management,2018-10-01,Statens vegvesen;Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Competitive dialogue ;  Early contractor involvement ;  Innovation ;  Procurement procedure ;  Public projects

NASA's eXploration Systems and Habitation (X-Hab) Academic Innovation Challenge,"Future exploration missions in the space between the Earth and the Moon or beyond will require complex operational activities to ensure that crew, cargo, and exploration systems safely reach their destination. Through the eXploration Systems and Habitation (X-Hab) Academic Innovation Challenge, NASA develops strategic partnerships and collaborations with universities to increase knowledge in technologies, capabilities, and operational approaches related to future human spaceflight missions. X-Hab activities help NASA bridge strategic knowledge gaps, better understand technology risk reduction, and combine the innovative approaches and diverse insights of university teams with unique agency expertise. The X-Hab Academic Innovation competition links with senior- and graduate-level design curricula that emphasize hands-on development of functional prototypes for deep space exploration missions. Research topics are identified and funded annually by NASA technology projects in collaboration with the National Space Grant Foundation. University teams submit proposals based on their interests and capabilities, and multiple small awards are made for the design and creation of studies or products that align with NASA strategic objectives. The selected project teams implement the design course during the fall and spring semesters using a systems engineering approach that requires formal reviews with NASA for requirements and system definition, preliminary design, and critical design. The challenges allow students to follow genuine hardware and systems engineering development processes and gain valuable experience that will extend to their professional careers. Since 2011, NASA has selected 49 X-Hab student concepts to address space habitation systems including advanced fabrication concepts, plant growth, atmosphere management, waste handling, and recycling. This paper provides a status and overview of submissions received, selected projects, success stories, and lessons learned.

Software startup engineering: A systematic mapping study,"Software startups have long been a significant driver in economic growth and innovation. The on-going failure of the major number of startups calls for a better understanding of state-of-the-practice of startup activities. Objective With a focus on engineering perspective, this study aims at identifying the change in focus of research area and thematic concepts operating startup research. A systematic mapping study on 74 primary papers (in which 27 papers are newly selected) from 1994 to 2017 was conducted with a comparison with findings from previous mapping studies. A classification schema was developed, and the primary studies were ranked according to their rigour. We discovered that most research has been conducted within the SWEBOK knowledge areas software engineering process, management, construction, design, and requirements, with the shift of focus towards process and management areas. We also provide an alternative classification for future startup research. We find that the rigour of the primary papers was assessed to be higher between 2013–2017 than that of 1994–2013. We also find an inconsistency of characterizing startups. Future work can focus on certain research themes, such as startup evolution models and human aspects, and consolidate the thematic concepts describing software startups.",Berg V.; Birkeland J.; Nguyen-Duc A.; Pappas I.; Jaccheri L.,Journal,Journal of Systems and Software,2018-10-01,IT-bygget,Software development ;  Software engineering ;  Software startup ;  Startup ;  Systematic mapping study
The technology of the middle class: Understanding the fulfilment of adoption intentions in Queensland's rapid uptake residential solar photovoltaics market,"Residential solar photovoltaics (PV), a once niche technology reliant on direct regulatory support to stimulate its adoption, has progressively become more competitive because of economies of learning and scale in production. Given its extraordinary market growth, a better understanding of the various market and social factors affecting residential consumers’ PV purchasing decisions is required for policy makers to create efficient support mechanisms, by industry participants to better target marketing activities, and for more informed planning of centralised electricity generation and network infrastructure development. This paper reports on an analysis of the behavioural drivers of households as decision-making units fulfilling an intention to adopt PV. Drawing upon Rogers’ diffusion of innovation theory and using a logistic regression choice model, the actual outcomes of the residential PV market are examined in the state of Queensland, Australia. A recent survey of more than 8000 households is used to investigate the difference in demographic and motivational factors among households with the stated intention to purchase PV with those that have already adopted the technology. Our findings suggest that PV is the technology of the middle class. This reasoning is made based on surveyees’ stated concerns over rising electricity bills and survey data which indicates that economic life events have a significant influence over perceptions of affordability. Households need to be concerned with rising electricity bills to be motivated to adopt PV, but must also have access to sufficient capital to afford its upfront cost. Familiarity with the technology appeared to reduce adoption motivations based on self-sufficiency and intentions to go off grid.",Bondio S.; Shahnazari M.; McHugh A.,Journal,Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,2018-10-01,Aurecon;University College London;Murdoch University;Ernst and Young Consulting,Adoption intention ;  Households choice ;  Logistic regression ;  Motivational factors ;  Solar photovoltaic

A study on the correlation between technology innovation and the new-type urbanization in Shaanxi province,"In the past three decades, China has experienced vigorous urbanization. However, the economy-centered urbanization caused social issues and is being replaced by the new-type people-centered urbanization. Technology innovation plays a key role in urbanization. Previous studies examine the relationship between technology innovation and the traditional economy-centered urbanization. But the relationship between technology innovation and the new-type people-centered urbanization remains unknown. As such, this paper develops a comprehensive evaluation index system for technology innovation and the new-type urbanization based on the data from Shaanxi province between 2000 and 2014. A variation coefficient method is applied to determine the weight of each index. Then a model is proposed and tested. At the end, conclusions are reached based on the results of the tests on the model.

The conventional approach, based on discrete assignments by subjective judgment with predetermined categories, cannot effectively capture latent topics from large volumes of scholarly data. Hence, this study adopts the topic model approach, which automatically discovers topics that pervade a large and unstructured collection of documents, to uncover research topics in TIM research. The 50 topics of TIM research are identified through the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model from 11,693 articles published from 1997 to 2016 in 11 TIM journals, and top 10 most popular topics in TIM research are briefly reviewed. We then explore topic trends by examining the changes in topics rankings over different time periods and identifying hot and cold topics of TIM research over the last two decades. For each of the 11 TIM journals, the areas of subspecialty and the effects of editor changes on topic portfolios are also investigated. The findings of this study are expected to provide implications for researchers, journal editors, and policy makers in the field of TIM.",Lee H.; Kang P.,Journal,Journal of Technology Transfer,2018-10-01,Seoul National University of Science and Technology;Korea University,Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) ;  Research topic ;  Technology and innovation management ;  Topic model
Surrendering to growth? The European Union's goals for research and technology in the Horizon 2020 framework,"The European Union is one of the major global players in environmental protection and sustainability policy, and increasingly addresses themes such as human wellbeing, global justice and development. Grounded in the degrowth literature, this paper asks how the European Union measures progress, economic development and the relevance of environmental protection. Specifically, this article aims at tracing degrowth elements in the Horizon 2020 program, i.e. the research and innovation agenda and funding scheme of the Union, which constitutes one of the European Union's major instruments for steering economic development. Employing a frame analysis this research detects a minor agenda pointing beyond conventional growth perspectives; however, conventional growth remains the central focus in the Horizon 2020 framework even where “green growth” measures are discussed. This research shows that this pattern is especially evident in technology policy and schemes related to information and communication technology in particular. The article reflects on the rationales for why the European Union pursues only a minor degrowth agenda. It points to a neoliberal meta-frame and to the effects of path dependency related to the Union's common market conceived of as a driver of prosperity. Finally, the paper identifies comparative policy analysis as a promising area for deeper integration of degrowth theory in political science research.",Pollex J.; Lenschow A.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2018-10-01,Osnabrück University,Degrowth and policy ;  European Union ;  Horizon 2020 ;  Information and communication technology ;  Research policy ;  Sustainability
New narratives for innovation,"Sociotechnical imaginaries are visions of desired social and technological futures created and sustained by stakeholders in science, industry and politics. Within the dominating innovation narratives there are a number of implicit and explicit beliefs that are both descriptive and normative. Technological optimism is the prevailing discourse, challenged by alternative imaginaries, among them a narrative of degrowth. In this paper we argue for the importance of producing more democratic and sustainable imaginations of future social and technological trajectories. We indicate how new narratives for innovation may include different perspectives and sources of knowledge, including heterodox economics, bio-economics, science and technology studies, and Post-Normal Science. The replacement of policy narratives, however, is not achieved through science speaking truth to power. If that were the case, policies would have changed a long time ago. The present analysis and discussion illustrates how the challenge of replacement is itself one that calls for a reflexive understanding of the relationship between knowledge, belief and agency in complex research and innovation (R&I) systems.",Strand R.; Saltelli A.; Giampietro M.; Rommetveit K.; Funtowicz S.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2018-10-01,ICTA-UAB Institut de Ciència i Tecnologia Ambientals;Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats;Universitetet i Bergen;European Centre for Governance in Complexity,Post-normal science ;  Sociotechnical imaginaries
"Innovation for de-growth: A case study of counter-hegemonic practices from Kerala, India","Our research focuses on the cross-pollination of the discourses of innovation and (post)development in the Global South. We suggest that the buzzword innovation is progressively infiltrating the lexicon and situated practices of development. Within this a hegemonic framing of innovation is emerging that leverages the language of inclusion to promote connection to, and participation in, the global free market economy. This, we hypothesise is closing down a broader debate concerning the goals and roles of innovation and technology in the so called developing world. At the same time, our research suggests that this emerging hegemony is contested, presenting as alternative, minority framings with different normative underpinnings for technology and innovation that challenge the pro-growth and market-led dominant paradigm. We present the results of one of these through a qualitative in-depth case study conducted in the Indian state of Kerala. The case provides interesting insights for the degrowth community in two regards. First it shows a concrete example of an alternative framing of technology underpinned by a set of normative principles connected to those of degrowth. Second, the case shows that alternative technological paradigms based on principles aligned with those of degrowth are not only possible, but can and do co-exist with the hegemonic paradigm.",Pansera M.; Owen R.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2018-10-01,University of Exeter Business School;ABIS - THE ACADEMY OF BUSINESS IN SOCIETY,Degrowth from the Global South ;  Discourse of development ;  Technological innovation

Recent Progress in Fused-Ring Based Nonfullerene Acceptors for Polymer Solar Cells,"The progress of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) is closely related to the innovation of photoactive materials (donor and acceptor materials), interface engineering, and device optimization. Especially, the development of the photoactive materials dominates the research filed in the past decades. Photoactive materials are basically classified as p-type organic semiconductor donor (D) and an n-type organic semiconductor acceptor (A). In the past two decades, fullerene derivatives are the dominant acceptors for high efficiency PSCs. Nevertheless, the limited absorption and challenging structural tunability of fullerenes hinder further improve the efficiency of PSCs. Encouragingly, the recent progresses of fused-ring based A-D-A type nonfullerene acceptors exhibit great potential in enhancing the photovoltaic performance of devices, driving the power conversion efficiency to over 13%. Such kind of nonfullerene acceptors is usually based on indacenodithiophene (IDT) or its extending backbone core and end-caped with strong electron-withdrawing group. Owing to the strong push-pulling effects, the acceptors possess strong absorption in the visible-NIR region and low-lying HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) level, which can realize both high open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current density of the devices. Moreover, the photo-electronic and aggregative properties of the acceptors can be flexibly manipulated via structural design. Many strategies have been successfully employed to tune the energy levels, absorption features, and aggregation properties of the fused-ring based acceptors. In this review, we will summarize the recent progress in developing highly efficient fused-ring based nonfullerene acceptors. We will mainly focus our discussion on the correlating factors of molecular structures to their absorption, molecular energy levels, and photovoltaic performance. It is envisioned that an analysis of the relationship between molecular structures and photovoltaic properties would contribute to a better understanding of this kind of acceptors for high-efficiency PSCs.",Cui C.,Journal,Frontiers in Chemistry,2018-09-25,Soochow University,energy levels ;  molecular design ;  nonfullerene acceptor ;  polymer solar cells ;  power conversion efficiency
Practice of and suggestions on CBM development in China,"The coalbed methane (CBM) development experiences of big CBM production countries (e.g. USA and Australia) are obviously unsuitable to be directly applied to China's CBM development. As several middle-high rank CBM resources with CBM principal production areas in the Qinshui Basin and along the eastern margin of the Ordos Basin as the representatives are put into scale development, summarizing domestic CBM development practices is of great significance to avoiding development risks and increasing development re-practice level. In this paper, the characteristics of domestic CBM resources were studied, and the progresses and results of development practices were reviewed. Then, suggestions on CBM development were proposed specifically from the aspects of pre-development evaluation, geology & gas reservoir engineering study and engineering technology selection. And the following research results were obtained. First, China's CBM resources are characterized by abundant resource, multiple types, poor reservoir conditions, low yield per well, and long production ramp-up period. Second, the guarantee of the successful development is to pay attention to the pre-development evaluation, the preparation of development programs and readjustment programs, the innovation of development theories and technologies, and the process management of engineering construction. Third, the basis for the CBM successful development is to set up reasonable content and rhythm of pre-development evaluation, which shall be treated differently according to specific geological conditions. Fourth, the core to prepare a rational CBM development scheme is reservoir evaluation, dynamic tracing and evaluation, well pattern and well type selection, and multi-layer commingled production selection. Fifth, the development of engineering technologies shall focus on reservoir protection and stimulation, production control technology and low-cost strategy. It is concluded that the prerequisite and key to successful CBM development is to carry out pre-development evaluation, geological & gas reservoir engineering study and engineering & technology innovation as well.",Mu F.; Wang H.; Wu J.; Sun B.,Journal,Natural Gas Industry,2018-09-25,Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration and Development;Xinjiang University,CBM reservoir engineering ;  China ;  Coalbed methane (CBM) ;  Development effect ;  Development practice ;  Development suggestion ;  Engineering technology ;  Geological study ;  Pre-development evaluation
Research on splitting and alienation of split fault in technological innovation network,"After more than ten years of efforts to explore scholars have not yet reached a consensus on the formation and evolution mechanism of technological innovation network, this paper attempts to introduce fault theory into this field. In this paper, we use the patent application of China's electronic information industry as a sample to construct the inter-organizational technology innovation network, and explore the mechanism of the split fault on the subgroup polarization in the view of network embedding. The results show that the intensity of the binary relationship embedded in the tissue can cause the potential splitting of the whole network when the distribution of the different members is not uniform, but the split fault has no significant direct effect on the subgroup polarization. When the structure is embedded When the level of embedding is high, the effect of split fault on subgroup polarization is improved.",Yang Y.; Dang X.; Cheng L.,Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2018-09-22,Xi'an University of Technology,Common Goal ;  Fault ;  Resource Integration ;  Technology Innovation
Research Framework and Anticipated Results of the Key Technology and Integrated Demonstration of Mountain Torrent Disaster Monitoring and Early Warning,"Due to the diversity and complexity of mountain flood disasters, the research in key technical fields is still in the initial stage and cannot meet the actual needs of current mountain flood disasters. How to accurately forecast local heavy rainfall, develop a mountain flood monitoring technical system and a localized flood disaster prediction model, refine the dynamic warning indicators of mountain flood disasters, realize the transition from post-disaster relief to pre-disaster prevention, build a risk assessment platform, construct a mountain flood disaster prevention model, and improve mountain flood disaster warning and risk prevention capabilities are the frontiers and hot issues of current mountain flood dis- aster research, and the practical problems that must be faced in the construction of county-level non-engineering measures for mountain flood disaster prevention which strongly implemented by the country. Focusing on the above issues, the following three key research objectives are summed up. The first one is clarifying the dynamic process of mountain flood disasters, establishing a local rainstorm forecast model and a mountain flood dynamic simulation model. The second one is developing and constructing a multi-element monitoring technology and system for mountain flood, realizing real-time dynamic transmission and release of mountain flood disaster warning and risk assessment information, solving the problem of low accuracy of mountain flood peak flow forecast, short warning period and short-term emergency response. The last one is building a multi-level and multi-target dynamic early-warning and risk assessment platform for mountain flood disasters, refining the disaster prevention and mitigation mode of mountain flood disasters, and demonstrating and promoting that to the public. The following innovations will be achieved through the research. Starting from revealing the formation mechanism of small and medium-scale weather systems that induce flood, short-term near-storm forecasting techniques in mountainous areas is developed, the prediction accuracy of floods and torrential rains in mountainous areas is improved, and the warning period of mountain flood disasters is effectively extended. By researching multi-source remote sensing, radar, micro-nano sensing, intelligent recognition and other mountain rainwater monitoring data acquisition technology and integration of adaptive, practical and stable traditional technologies, a multi-element three-dimensional monitoring technology system for air and land integration is built, technological innovation and extend the mountain flood warning period is realized. Through the analysis of the response process of flood catastrophe process in mountainous areas, the formation process of rainstorm mountain floods and the dynamic mechanism of disasters are clarified, and the dynamic simulation model of mountain flood process based on rainfall prediction and dynamic monitoring of soil water content is constructed to improve the accuracy and reliability of mountain flood warning. Taking the migration process of mountain floods as the entry point, a multi-index warning model for mountain flood disasters is established, real-time dynamic grading warning technology for mountain flood disasters is developed, the warning period of disasters is effectively prolonged, and the aging time for emergency rescue responseis improved.",Zhang P.; Ding W.; Wang X.,Journal,Gongcheng Kexue Yu Jishu/Advanced Engineering Sciences,2018-09-20,"Changjiang Water Resources Commission;Ministry of Water Resources, P.R.

Re-engineering of business processes as a bank efficiency method,"Currently, the most advanced commercial banks that have undergone expansion and cost reduction have realized the need for a differentiation strategy - ensuring margin over the market average and / or loyalty by personalizing customer relationships. Although the burden of customer base growth and market share gain is still relevant, it is necessary to pay more attention to retaining profitable customers and increasing revenue growth from existing customer base. A business model defines how the bank creates and delivers value to customers and then converts payments received into profits. To take advantage of innovation, business people need to excel not only in product innovation, but also in designing the business model, design options, and the technological needs of customers. The main objective of the research is to identify business processes in a client-oriented bank that would ensure the achievement of goals by controlling the quantitative indicators. In this context, it is necessary to determine not only the methodology of optimizing the business processes within the bank, but also to successfully implement the results of business process reengineering. The most promising strategy for establishing long-term contacts with existing and potential customers is a strategy based on the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) concept. This concept implies a reorientation of the strategic directions of banking business development from the products and characteristics of the bank's internal device to the client's needs and expectations. We mention that the process of implementing CRM systems in banks is linked to a rather complicated integration process with many back-office and front office applications used for passive and active operations, card processing, call centre automation, etc. This requires changing many internal processes and bulky investments. In addition, the CRM system differs from standard solutions, as it is associated with service provision rather than with goods. In a client-oriented bank, the activities of all subdivisions are subordinated to one main objective - to increase sales through a fast, high-quality customer service. With such an organization of the commercial bank, the subdivisions that perform the basic functions are coordinated with each other, being links of a horizontal technological chain and fulfilling the tasks of serving the sales subdivisions. Today, in the face of a changing economic situation, the reengineering of business processes involves a radical and revolutionary restructuring of obsolete business processes and is one of the ways to increase banking efficiency.",Topala P.; Postolache V.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2018-09-20,Alecu Russo Balti State University,
Analysis on the double dividend effects of the environmental tax and fee policies in China --the estimation of the System GMM and the panel threshold model.,"Based on Pigou Theory, environmental tax is an external regulation to solve environmental pollution. In order to test whether the environmental tax and fee policies could produce a double dividend, namely reducing pollution and encouraging green technology innovation, we constructed the dynamic panel models and the panel threshold models of environmental tax and fee policies in this paper. The results showed that the high population density in the region hadn`t become the constraint of environmental dividend, and the industrial structure and the energy structure need to be further optimized to promote double dividend effect. The panel threshold model estimation results of the environment taxes showed that there was a nonlinear time-varying characteristics between the environmental tax and environmental pollution, and green technology innovation. The double dividend effect can only be achieved well by selecting the appropriate environmental tax interval. And the higher the level of economic development, the more obvious of the double dividend. Therefore, it should be the key to win the battle of environmental protection to make the comprehensive environmental tax system based on the heterogeneous characteristics of regional economic development in 2018.",Fan D.; Liang P.; Liu B.; Yao X.; Pan Y.,Journal,Zhongguo Huanjing Kexue/China Environmental Science,2018-09-20,Dongbei University of Finance and Economics,double dividend ;  environmental tax and fee policies ;  panel threshold model ;  system GMM estimation
Wind technology innovation in the US,"When technological innovations occur in the wind energy sector we should observe a reduction in the cost of electricity production. However, the accuracy with which the innovation-driven unit cost reduction is measured in the literature is open to challenge. We apply an engineering model to generate a long time-series of wind electricity production cost reduction data in the US. Our data is exclusive because it identifies the purely engineering-driven innovation process and excludes other potential market, financial, geographic or climatic forces. We also analyze the widely applied learning curve method in the innovation literature. Learning curve predicts future unit cost reduction based on the installed capacity. We propose an extension to the learning curve method which better suits the US market. We find that constant reduction of cost explains innovation just as good as the cumulative production.",Laxton D.,Conference Proceeding,"International Conference on the European Energy Market, EEM",2018-09-20,CERGE-EI Center for Economic Research and Graduate Education - Economics Institute,Innovation ;  Learning Curve ;  Levelized Cost of Energy ;  Wind Machine Vintages
Managing tensions in sustainable business models: Exploring instrumental and integrative strategies,"This study empirically examines tensions around business model innovations for sustainability and the strategies that organizations employ to manage these tensions. A central conjecture of the study is that in order to successfully manage sustainable business models, firms need to confront sustainability's oftentimes paradoxical tensions. The research examined 30 firms that had sought to make business model innovations for sustainability; the results suggest that one group of organizations was shy of embracing these tensions and relied primarily on an instrumental or narrow ‘business case’ approach, viewing sustainability as an “either/or” scenario. However, another group of firms was aiming to work through these tensions by utilizing more paradoxical or integrative strategies, thus aiming for a “both/and” scenario. This group found it easier to manage their sustainable business models. The results highlight how applying the lens of paradox can help organizations to make sense of the complexity of sustainability; paradoxical thinking can help to reduce tensions, ambiguity and uncertainty and improve the management of complex sustainability challenges. In addition to their practical relevance, the findings have implications for both the literature on sustainable business models and the emerging paradox perspective on corporate sustainability.",van Bommel K.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2018-09-20,Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,Business case ;  Corporate sustainability ;  Instrumental approach ;  Integrative approach ;  Paradox ;  Sustainable business models ;  Tensions

An application of EDM: Design of a new online system for correcting exam paper,"With the new era in information technology, Educational Informationization not only profoundly affects the modern education paradigm, but also provides strong technological feasibility to facilitate and realize education reform. However, the ubiquitous accessibility brought about by today's internet and wireless technologies creates explosive increase in educational related data (big data) from a diversity of resources. It also becomes much more challenging to analyze and understand the underlying meaning of the big data. It is high time that the modern education systems should embed data mining into education paradigm and apply decision analysis to guide teaching strategy. It is our belief that Education Data Mining (EDM) is vital to achieve such educational innovation. This paper proposes a novel Online System for Correcting and Analyzing Exam Paper (OSCAEP) based on a combination of EDM and Network Informatization, which is aimed to provide in-depth analysis of exam papers, to construct an innovative EDM model and to study the interrelationship between educational factors. (1) First, we introduce the background, significance, and purpose of our research. We illustrate OSCAEP from three perspectives: a. Educators: For educators, they can get an insight into potential problems from the quantitative results by data mining; b. Learners: For learners, they can understand their learning progress from various angles; c. Administrators: For administrators, they can timely redesign the education strategies based on such quantitative feedbacks. (2) Second, we present the innovations of OSCAEP from theoretical part and technological part. OSCAEP also include some advanced teaching theories such as Personalized Learning, Precision Teaching and Customized Teaching. Our main technological innovation hinges upon integrating several machine learning data analysis techniques (e.g., K-means, DNN) to train scores and obtain the classification rules. (3) Third, Our presentation of OSCAEP contains two major parts: a. build a distributed multi-layer hardware architecture, which includes web server, application server cluster and management workstation, and b. provide a multi-stage pipeline software model, which expands the traditional process of data mining into six stages (Data Preparation, Data Filtration, Data Pre-processing, Data Conversion, Model Building and Data Training). From the application perspective, we develop an effective model for examination analysis and learning behavior prediction based on education big data. Examples include statistical score data of different types of questions (Blank, True/False, Choice and Coding). (4) Forth, OSCAEP also offers educators some potentially very valuable suggestions and advices. It is found that the learning performance has no direct relation with the learning time, but it has much to do with the learning habits. With the EDM analysis results, educators can better customize teaching and design efficient rules and regulations in accordance with learner's features. This leads to precision teaching and plays a vital role for a more desirable atmosphere for learning and teaching. In short, OSCAEP processes information in a digital, automatic, intelligent and networked way. As such, it provides more precise and timely information than the traditional approach.",Li Y.,Conference Proceeding,"13th International Conference on Computer Science and Education, ICCSE 2018",2018-09-19,School of Engineering and Applied Science;Beihang University,Big Data ;  EDM ;  Intelligent Evaluation ;  Machine Learning ;  OSCAEP

Analysis of the policies led to the identification of seven themes: prosperity, humanity, inclusivity, capacity, sustainability, inquiry, and community. These themes guided the creation of a model of EEFI. The model consists of four principal bases: learner-based; STEM + AE-based, problem-based and; project-based. Learner-based focuses on what engineers are in terms of their personal and professional competencies. STEM + AE are a reminder that engineers must be more than technicians, well-versed in STEM. Their education needs to include the arts and entrepreneurship. The problem base refers to EEFI activity being driven by complex, authentic, ill-structured challenges, problems and issues that have a social as well as a technical character. The project-base involves collaborative efforts to find answers to questions and create solutions to problems and challenges. Implications for research highlight a range of approaches to researching EEFI from quantitative surveys of perceptions of participants to complex research designs whereby engineers in training are collaboratively solving real problems in communities.",Sunthonkanokpong W.; Murphy E.; Tuntrakool S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2017 7th World Engineering Education Forum, WEEF 2017- In Conjunction with: 7th Regional Conference on Engineering Education and Research in Higher Education 2017, RCEE and RHEd 2017, 1st International STEAM Education Conference, STEAMEC 2017 and 4th Innovative Practices in Higher Education Expo 2017, I-PHEX 2017",2018-09-17,King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang;Memorial University of Newfoundland,Asia ;  Engineering education ;  higher education ;  innovation ;  model ;  pedagogy ;  research ;  STEM

Develop a model to measure the ethical effects of students through social media use,"Social media users can be negatively affected by cyber harassment. These effects can cause emotional distress and lead people to stop using social network sites or to end their life. In addition, the users of this technology usually get upset when network providers interfere and consider such interference to be unfair. Therefore, this paper attempted to mitigate the gap in the literature concerning the use of social media for engaging in cyber harassment in the context of higher education. Therefore, the main objective was to develop a model that will bridge this gap. The model developed in this paper is based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, theory of planned behavior, and technology support. To achieve the study's objectives, a questionnaire was used as the main data collection method, and it was distributed to 340 students who used social media. This paper argues that these decisions of interference can be handled by employing a method that users find sufficient and appropriate. In conclusion, this research specifically proposes a model for identifying the significant factors that are anticipated to play major roles in minimizing cyber harassment among Saudi students. The proposed model will help administrations and decision makers to formulate strategies that can significantly affect anti-cyber harassment among students.",Abdullah Moafa F.; Ahmad K.; Al-Rahmi W.; Yahaya N.; Bin Kamin Y.; Alamri M.,Journal,IEEE Access,2018-09-16,King Faisal University;Universiti Teknologi Malaysia;Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,engage in cyber harassment ;  ethical effects ;  Social media used ;  technology use ;  theory of planned behavior (TPB)
Design thinking and agile practices for software engineering an opportunity for innovation,"Commonly, the instruction of Software Engineering implements processes that are inherent to the theory and practice of software development. Traditional and Agile methods lay the foundation for building “functional software products” that meet the requirements of a system of a larger scope. However, if we consider software as a product that frequently has the mission of satisfying the needs of human users, we can go beyond the typical “analysis - design - implementation - testing” process, to reinterpret it with the “empathize - define - ideate - prototype - testing” proposed by Design Thinking, a development methodology commonly used in creative and innovative professional settings. In this work, we study the use of Design Thinking as a methodological approach for the instruction of Software Engineering at undergraduate level, in courses that have the particular aim of creating innovative software products from scratch. We describe the similarities and differences between Design Thinking and Software Development Processes, taking as instance Agile Practices. We compare evidence on methods and deliverables produced by students in their learning path using Agile Practices and Design Thinking in two different educational environments. Finally, we discuss coincidences, weaknesses, and opportunities to keep investigating in this topic as a research subject, toward finding practices to promote in students both creativity and technical discipline to develop innovative software solutions.",Corral L.; Fronza I.,Conference Proceeding,SIGITE 2018 - Proceedings of the 19th Annual SIG Conference on Information Technology Education,2018-09-14,"Tecnológico de Monterrey, Querétaro;Free University of Bozen-Bolzano",Agile ;  Creativity ;  Design Thinking ;  Education ;  Software Engineering
"Multi-Stimuli-Responsive Polymer Particles, Films, and Hydrogels for Drug Delivery","Stimuli-responsive polymer materials are powerful tools in drug delivery and tissue engineering. Because of the large variations in physiological conditions between normal microenvironments and diseased sites, polymer materials with single responsiveness may not achieve the desired goals in a complex physiological microenvironment. Instead, polymer materials responsive to multiple physical or chemical stimuli are highly desired for biomedical applications (e.g., drug delivery). In this review, we highlight recent studies in multi-stimuli-responsive materials with a specific emphasis on polymer particles, films, and hydrogels. The synthetic strategies employed to produce these responsive materials are described. Applications in drug delivery are highlighted, followed by a discussion of the current research focus and future trends. Responsive polymer materials are designed to alter their properties upon exposure to physical, chemical, and biological stimuli. They have served as powerful tools in drug delivery and tissue engineering. Through the integration of functional groups, these materials are engineered to “sense” the surrounding physiological environments and enable on-demand release of encapsulated therapeutic cargos into highly specific targets. However, the physiological environment is complex, and polymer materials with single responsiveness, in some cases, cannot achieve the desired goals in drug-delivery systems. The exploitation of polymer materials responsive to multiple stimuli promises new innovations in the design of functional materials for drug delivery. We provide an overview of the recent design and applications of multi-stimuli-responsive polymer particles, films, and hydrogels. Biological parameters vary significantly between normal microenvironments and diseased sites and can be exploited as triggers to achieve controlled release of drugs from polymer carriers. These parameters include but are not limited to pH, temperature, enzyme, and redox species. This review highlights the recently reported diverse strategies in designing multi-stimuli-responsive polymer particles, films, and hydrogels and discusses barriers to clinical translation.",Fu X.; Hosta-Rigau L.; Chandrawati R.; Cui J.,Journal,Chem,2018-09-13,Shandong University;UNSW Medicine;Technical University of Denmark,drug delivery ;  multi-stimuli responsiveness ;  polymer films ;  polymer hydrogels ;  polymer particles ;  SDG3: Good health and well-being
"Gender design methods for engineering, responsible innovation and interaction","Although there is a large number of studies in the literature designed to analyze the low representation of women in technology and, especially, in information technology, studies to analyze how these technologies have been designed and constructed are scarce. In the area of HumanComputer Interaction (HCI) there is an emerging and promising field of research that focuses on the study of gender differences in the use of computers and the Internet, as well as providing recommendations for the design of technology with gender perspective. In this article, we will present different methodological approaches that allow for the inclusion of a gender perspective in technology design, and, recommendations for the design and development of software focused on gender.",González-González C.; Gil Iranzo R.; Paderewski P.; Padilla-Zea N.,Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2018-09-12,International University of La Rioja;Universitat de Lleida;Universidad de Granada;Universidad de la Laguna,Engineering ;  Ethics ;  Gender ;  Software
DEDICATE: Proposal for a conceptual framework to develop dementia-friendly integrated eCare support,"Background: Evidence shows that the implementation of information and communication technologies (ICT) enabled services supporting integrated dementia care represents an opportunity that faces multi-pronged challenges. First, the provision of dementia support is fragmented and often inappropriate. Second, available ICT solutions in this field do not address the full spectrum of support needs arising across an individual's whole dementia journey. Current solutions fail to harness the potential of available validated e-health services, such as telehealth and telecare, for the purposes of dementia care. Third, there is a lack of understanding of how viable business models in this field can operate. The field comprises both professional and non-professional players that interact and have roles to play in ensuring that useful technologies are developed, implemented and used. Methods: Starting from a literature review, including relevant pilot projects for ICT-based dementia care, we define the major requirements of a system able to overcome the limitations evidenced in the literature, and how this system should be integrated in the socio-technical ecosystem characterizing this disease. From here, we define the DEDICATE architecture of such a system, and the conceptual framework mapping the architecture over the requirements. Results: We identified three macro-requirements, namely the need to overcome: deficient technology innovation, deficient service process innovation, and deficient business models innovation. The proposed architecture is a three level architecture in which the center (data layer) includes patients' and informal caregivers' preferences, memories, and other personal data relevant to sustain the dementia journey, is connected through a middleware (service layer), which guarantees core IT services and integration, to dedicated applications (application layer) to sustain dementia care (formal support services, FSS), and to existing formal care infrastructures, in order to guarantee care coordination (care coordination services, CCS). Conclusions: The proposed DEDICATE architecture and framework envisages a feasible means to overcome the present barriers by: (1) developing and integrating technologies that can follow the patient and the caregivers throughout the development of the condition, since the early stages in which the patient is able to build up preferences and memories will be used in the later stages to maximise personalization and thereby improve efficacy and usability (technology innovation); (2) guaranteeing the care coordination between formal and informal caregivers, and giving an active yet supported role to the latter (service innovation); and (3) integrating existing infrastructures and care models to decrease the cost of the overall care pathway, by improving system interoperability (business model innovation).",Marceglia S.; Rigby M.; Alonso A.; Keeling D.; Kubitschke L.; Pozzi G.,Journal,BioMedical Engineering Online,2018-09-12,Empirica GmbH;Hospital Clínic de Barcelona;Keele University;Politecnico di Milano;Università degli Studi di Trieste;University of Sussex;Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico,Care infrastructure ;  Dementia ;  eHealth ;  Family-centred ;  ICT architecture ;  Integrated care ;  Integrated eCare ;  Patient-centred ;  Socio-technical ecosystem
Constructing future scenarios as a tool to foster responsible research and innovation among future synthetic biologists,"The emerging field of synthetic biology, the (re-)designing and construction of biological parts, devices and systems for useful purposes, may simultaneously resolve some issues and raise others. In order to develop applications robustly and in the public interest, it is important to organize reflexive strategies of assessment and engagement in early stages of development. Against this backdrop, initiatives related to the concept of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) have also appeared. This paper describes such an initiative: the construction of future scenarios to explore the plausibility and desirability of potential synthetic biology innovations. We guided teams of synthetic biology students who participated in the large international Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) competition, in constructing scenarios aimed at exploring the plausibility and desirability of potential synthetic biology innovations. In this paper we aim to examine to what extent, and how, constructing such future scenarios contributes to RRI. In order to do so, we conducted observations and interviews to understand what kind of learning and reflection was promoted by constructing the scenarios in terms of four dimensions, which are discussed prominently in the literature on RRI: anticipation, inclusion, reflexivity and responsiveness. While we focus on how constructing future scenarios can contribute to strengthening RRI at a project (and individual) level, we also consider how far our experiment may foster RRI in the iGEM competition in general, and perhaps even inspire constructive collaboration between 'social scientists' and 'natural scientists' in the context of larger scientific research programmes.",Betten A.; Rerimassie V.; Broerse J.; Stemerding D.; Kupper F.,Journal,"Life Sciences, Society and Policy",2018-09-10,Technische Universiteit Eindhoven;Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam Athena Instituut;Rathenau Institute - KNAW,Education ;  Ethics ;  Future scenarios ;  iGEM ;  Learning ;  Responsible research and innovation ;  Synthetic biology
"Bridging exercise science, cognitive psychology, and medical practice: Is ""cognitive fatigue"" a remake of ""the emperor's new clothes""?","Fatigue is such a multifaceted construct it has sprouted specific research fields and experts in domains as different as exercise physiology, cognitive psychology, human factors and engineering, and medical practice. It lacks a consensus definition: it is an experimental concept, a symptom, a risk, a cause (e.g., of performance decrement) and a consequence (e.g., of sleep deprivation). This fragmentation of knowledge leads to slower dissemination of novel insights, and thus to a poorer research. Indeed, what may seem as a novel result in one field, may very well be old news in another, hence leading to this ""innovation"" being a scientific equivalent to the emperor's new clothes. The current paper aims to describe the common denominator in the different areas of expertise where fatigue is investigated. Indeed, rather than focusing on the differences in semantics and conceptualization, we hope that identifying common concepts may be inductive of easier multidisciplinary research. Considering the vastness of fatigue research in all areas identified as relevant-cognitive science, exercise physiology, and medical practice, this analysis has not the ambition to be an exhaustive review in all domains. We have reviewed the fatigue concepts and research in these areas and report the ones that are used to describe the proposed common model to be further investigated. The most promising common feature to cognitive science, exercise physiology and clinical practice is the notion of ""perceived effort."" This allows to account for interindividual differences, as well as for the situational variations in fatigue. It is applicable to both mental and physical constructs. It integrates motivational and emotional dimensions. It overcomes current polemics in various research fields, and it does not draw on any semantic ambiguity. We thus suggest a new model of fatigue and performance, whether this performance is mental or physical; and whether it is in a clinical range or relates to optimal functioning.",Pattyn N.; Van Cutsem J.; Dessy E.; Mairesse O.,Journal,Frontiers in Psychology,2018-09-10,"Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Brugmann, Brussels;Vrije Universiteit Brussel;University of Kent;Koninklijke Militaire School - Ecole Royale Militaire",Chronic fatigue ;  Cognitive fatigue ;  Effortful control ;  Exercise tolerance ;  Fatigue ;  Performance ;  Sleep disorders
"Proposing a Delphi-Study as Non-Biased Alternative to Studies and Roadmaps Predicting the Future of Robotics, Automation A.I.","Currently, a multitude of studies, whitepapers and roadmaps claim to predict the future of robotics and automation. Unfortunately, all of them are to some extent limited in their scope, by design and/or are biased by some particular interests. In most cases this is not even by intention, but the fact, that the euRobotics Multiannual Roadmap and Strategic Research Agenda only focus on the European robotics community limits it to a certain field of view. The same applies for the U.S. Robotics Roadmap and other documents.

Optimization of China sponge city design: The case of Lincang Technology Innovation Park,"China launched the sponge city (SPC) initiative in 2013 to reduce municipal stormwater runoff. The design criteria are mainly the annual comprehensive runoff coefficient (ACRC) regulated in a design guideline. Numerous SPC alternatives with varied low-impact development (LID) measures can be designed to meet the ACRC. Obviously, the optimization of SPC design is significant. This study provides an approach to SPC design optimization that applies an optimized module of SUSTAIN to simulate SPC performance over a 10-year period. The targeted volume reduction was derived from the SWMM model and corresponded to the ACRC criteria. Based on the reduction, the minimal cost and cost-effectiveness analyses were conducted. The proposed approach was applied to the Lincang Technology Innovation Park (LCTIP) as a test case. Three scenarios were analyzed: The original design implemented on the site, the landscape improved design, and the most economical design. The results indicated that the optimized alternative may save up to 12.3% of the cost while meeting that ACRC value. The approach improves upon SPC design, particularly with regards to flood control. The present research will help decision makers to develop and select the most appropriate SPC design that is most cost-effective.",Li N.; Qin C.; Du P.,Journal,Water (Switzerland),2018-09-04,Tsinghua University,Design optimization ;  Lincang Technology Innovation Park (LCTIP) ;  Sponge city ;  Stormwater Management Model (SWMM) ;  System for Stormwater Analysis and Integration (SUSTAIN)
Survival of construction SMEs in macroeconomic crises: Innovation-based competitive strategies,"Purpose: This paper aims to present the effect of innovation on implementing competitive strategies (CSs) and to find their relationships on the survival of construction-related small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in macroeconomic crises. Design/methodology/approach: Data were compiled from construction SMEs in Turkey. The research used structural equation modeling to investigate the relationships between innovation, CSs and firm survival (FS). Findings: Innovative construction SMEs may implement differentiation and focus strategies and survive without CSs, whereas innovation may be obtained through cost leadership strategy. Also, differentiation and focus strategies may play a role to survive. However, the cost leadership strategy may be implemented after survival. Finally, differentiation strategy may be triggered by innovation and focus strategies. Research limitations/implications: The model may be applied on other construction organizations. Future studies may also examine the difference in findings concerning other industries and regions. Moreover, different factors may be added to the model. However, a larger group of samples could cause different results. Practical implications: This study may be a roadmap for practitioners to plan their firms’ strategies, considering innovation, CSs and FS. In this context, they may pay attention to innovative production processes to survive. Social implications: Survived SMEs may sustain their works through the prevention of crisis-based unemployment. Hence, this benefit may bring a wealthier society. Originality/value: This research is first to propose a model connecting innovation and CSs for SMEs’ survival in macroeconomic crises. This is convenient for rivalry of SMEs planning to be long-lasting enterprises.",Ulubeyli S.; Kazaz A.; Sahin S.,Journal,"Journal of Engineering, Design and Technology",2018-09-04,Bülent Ecevit University;Akdeniz Üniversitesi;ERDEMIR,Construction economic ;  Construction innovation ;  Strategy
Perspectives on pedagogical change: instructor and student experiences of a newly implemented undergraduate engineering dynamics curriculum<sup>*</sup>,"Engineering education has been slow to adopt research-based educational innovations. Few prior works on such adoption have investigated the combined classroom experiences of instructors and students when such innovations are being implemented. Therefore, this work focuses on the lived experiences of an instructor and her students when adopting an active, blended, and collaborative learning environment, known as Freeform, in a second-year dynamics course. Weekly reflections from the instructor were processed alongside student interviews using Thematic Analysis to discern prominent themes in their perspectives for comparison and discussion. The results indicate that the instructor navigated internal tensions between her previous instructional preferences and the philosophy and resources of Freeform. Similarly, students had to adapt to this new philosophy and suite of resources that were uncommon for their institution. Ultimately, this work highlights the contextual natures of teaching and learning, and how situational factors can influence educational innovation.",Evenhouse D.; Patel N.; Gerschutz M.; Stites N.; Rhoads J.; Berger E.; DeBoer J.,Journal,European Journal of Engineering Education,2018-09-03,College of Engineering;Purdue University;Trine University,active learning ;  blended learning ;  Faculty development ;  mechanical engineering ;  pedagogy of higher education
Toward Legitimate Governance of Solar Geoengineering Research: A Role for Sub-State Actors,"Two recently proposed solar radiation management (SRM) experiments in the United States have highlighted the need for governance mechanisms to guide SRM research. This paper draws on the literatures on legitimacy in global governance, responsible innovation, and experimental governance to argue that public engagement is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for any legitimate SRM governance regime. We then build on the orchestration literature to argue that, in the absence of federal leadership, U.S. states, such as California, New York, and other existing leaders in climate governance more broadly have an important role to play in the near-term development of SRM research governance. Specifically, we propose that one or more U.S. states should establish a new interdisciplinary advisory commission to oversee and review the governance of SRM research in their states. Centrally, we propose that state-level advisory commissions on SRM research could help build legitimacy in SRM research decisions through the inclusion of, at minimum: meaningful public engagement early in the research design process; an iterative and reflexive mechanism for learning and improving both participatory governance mechanisms and broader SRM governance goals over time; as well as mechanisms for adaptation and diffusion of governance mechanisms across jurisdictions and scales.",Jinnah S.; Nicholson S.; Flegal J.,Journal,"Ethics, Policy and Environment",2018-09-02,"University of California, Santa Cruz;American University;Spitzer Trust",

Rehabilitation satisfaction of taohong siwu decoction combined with acupoint moxibustion applied in older adults after total knee arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: With the “Bio-Psycho-Social” paradigm, rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has shifted from “Disease” to “Patient-Centered” to improve surgical safety and patient satisfaction. The core concept of modern rapid rehabilitation is based on the concept of people-oriented, and is the concrete practice of medical and humane care. How to pay more attention to the psychological rehabilitation of patients after replacement, elimination of pain, functional recovery, improve the comfort of treatment, orthopedic physicians need to push innovation and research in depth in our country. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of acupoint moxibustion combined with Taohong Siwu Decoction on the rehabilitation satisfaction of the patients after TKA. METHODS: Totally 186 older adults after undergoing TKA were enrolled at Lanzhou General Hospital of PLA from January 2015 to December 2016. The patients were divided into three groups: conventional group, Taohong Siwu Decoction group and combination group. The conventional group was given subcutaneous injection of low molecular weight heparin calcium, 4 000 U, once daily, conventional nurse and rehabilitation, oral administration of 200 mg of celecoxib, twice daily (7 days a course). The Taohong Siwu Decoction group received the same treatment with the conventional group, and was given Taohong Siwu Decoction (400 mL), twice daily. The combination group was given acupuncture and moxibustion on the basis of the first two treatments. The pain index was recorded at baseline, 7 and 90 days postoperatively. The Spitzer quality of life and QLQ-C30 scores at postoperative 90 days were compared among groups to assess the quality of life and rehabilitation satisfaction. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) Compared with the conventional group, the pain index in the Taohong Siwu Decoction and combination groups was significantly decreased at 7 and 90 days postoperatively (P < 0.01). There was significant difference in each index between Taohong Siwu Decoction and combination groups at different time points (P < 0.01). (2) Compared with the conventional group, the quality of life and rehabilitation satisfaction of the patients in the Taohong Siwu Decoction and combination groups were significantly improved (P < 0.01), but there was no significant difference between Taohong Siwu Decoction and combination groups (P > 0.05). (3) In summary, Taohong Siwu Decoction combined with acupoint moxibustion can alleviate the pain, and improve satisfaction and quality of life of the patients undergoing TKA. Based on the conventional treatment of low molecular weight heparin calcium for preventing deep venous thrombosis, the combination of Taohong Siwu Decoction and acupoint moxibustion exhibits excellent results in improving quality of life and satisfaction.",Jin R.; Liu Y.; Yao Y.; Liu Y.; Tao H.; Du S.; Chen H.; Liu J.,Journal,Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research,2018-09-01,Lanzhou General Hospital of PLA,"Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee ;  Pain Measurement ;  Tissue Engineering"
Wunderkammers: Powerful metaphors for ‘tangible’ experiential knowledge building,"Research problem: The paper identifies the need to support powerful metaphors that capture innovations of new emerging human computer interaction (HCI) technologies and innovative question and answering (Q&A) systems in the context of spatial learning and inquiry-based learning in education. Aim/goals of the research: Explore the potential of ‘Wunderkammer’ (curiosity cabinet) as a powerful metaphor to design new types of learning experiences catering for an ecology of artefacts (real of virtual objects) to provide a holistic context for educators to share and extend learning in action. Conclusions: We provide insight into the emergence of smart interactive objects with different types of sensors that can potentially support everyday life and the increasing access to new visual experiences through augment reality and virtual reality, for new types of tangible knowledge building that can be personalised and shared.

Analyzing the improvement policies of knowledge management by using system dynamics,"Knowledge management is one of the main driver of innovation in organizations that acts in a set form of processes and technology. In different organizations the trend of knowledge process maturity has its specific dynamics. For understanding this dynamics, a system analyzing is required. Therefore, the aim of this paper is the system analysis of knowledge management processes and study of the recommended solutions and policies for reducing the gap between the ideal and the current level of knowledge management processes in a case study. In this paper, system dynamics has been used for analyzing different policies and reducing the distance between the current and ideal level of knowledge management processes (knowledge identification, knowledge acquisition, knowledge sharing, knowledge protecting). This research has been applied on the case study of industrial engineering department in Ardakan University. Results show that the investment on knowledge acquisition in comparison with the other policies will increase the number of educational courses as well as the level of knowledge acquisition process. Thus, the total level of knowledge management will be increased. In addition, it is recommended to the mangers that the delay and adjust time for growing the knowledge processes levels should be reduced.",Fayyaz E.; Moosavirad S.,Journal,Iranian Journal of Information Processing Management,2018-09-01,Daneshgahe Shahid Bahonar-e-Kerman,Knowledge Acquisition ;  Knowledge Identification ;  Knowledge Management ;  Knowledge Sharing ;  System Dynamics
Effectiveness of ecodrainage application by using infiltration wells,"The increasing of population is directly in proportional with the increasing needs of human for settlements, particularly in the urban areas. It affects to the reduction of open land and its capacity to infiltrate the rain and surface water into the ground. The rainwater that should be conserved into the soil will be flooded or wasted into the river and conventional drainage channel. In this study, the drainage system of the certain area will be improved into the eco-drainage innovation to conserve rain water. Implementation of eco-drainage is conducted by installing the infiltration well along the study area. This research aims to observe the discharge that flows into the river body before and after the implementation of infiltration well and to measure the effectiveness of the system. The average rainfall data is computed using hydrological isohyet method, while the flow discharge to the drainage channel is calculated by the rational method. The soil permeability value is obtained by the in situ assays based on the SNI-03-3968-1995. The infiltration wells are constructed using waterproof wall and flat-permeable bottom portion. The results indicate that the effectiveness of infiltration wells reaches 100%, 95.53% and 81.52% of a 2, 5 and 10 years of return period.",Sulistiono B.; Fatmawati K.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research (IAHR)-Asia Pacific Division (APD) Congress: Multi-Perspective Water for Sustainable Development, IAHR-APD 2018",2018-09-01,Universitas Islam Indonesia,Ecodrainage ;  Effectiveness ;  Infiltration well ;  Permeability
Development of an acoustically optimized multi-layer surface-system based on synthetics,"To facilitate modern economies, the development of society and the extension of economic areas the traffic sector plays a leading role by supplying a technically functioning, efficient and environmentally compatible infrastructure. Due to the increase of transportation processes, especially the commercial transport, the mode of transport “road” is of great importance in this regard. However, this causes a steadily increasing exposure of the population to traffic-induced emissions – especially noise emissions have received more attention in recent years! Public infrastructure construction is subjected to numerous attempts aiming to standardize the tasks as well as the limitation of costs. The result has been that the innovation potential, especially in regard to designs limiting traffic noise, has not been made use of sufficiently. Furthermore, the performance limit of conventional materials has almost been reached which is why this research project developed and designed a completely new surface-material concept based on synthetic materials. The surface-system was designed to exhibit the highest possible acoustically favorable properties, was verified by examinations in the Vehicle-Pavement Interaction Facility of the Federal Highway Research Institute (BASt) and was constructed in-situ. The focus of the project was the development of a multi-layered wearing course system with a synthetic top layer, representing optimized texture-properties and a synthetically-bound bottom layer functioning as an absorption layer. In addition to the acoustic efficacy of such a wearing course system, the structural feasibility as well as the durability of the concept are subjects of the analysis. Over all the concept shows a level difference of tire-road noise of more than 8 dB(A) regardless of the speed – this is almost a half of the perceived volume. The presented results are converted into further development steps to facilitate transfer of the idea into a marketable product. This further development is carried out within the framework of the research project “Fundamental research on polymer materials and innovative production and installation technologies for road surface layer systems (INNO PAVE)” funded by the Federal Ministry of the Education and Research. In addition to the RWTH Aachen University, represented by the Chair and Institute of Highway Engineering Aachen, an interdisciplinary team from science, research and industry is involved in this further development, which will be finalized in 2018.

Biomimetics design for tribological applications,"Biomimetics, biomimicry and bionics are synonyms for the scientific discipline of creating new structures inspired by nature. Biomimetics systematically analyses the evolutionary processes of living organisms, their structural relationships, the characteristics of natural materials and it studies how this knowledge can be used to create the optimal products and new sustainable materials. In the past decade, the biomimetics has received an incentive for the development by the technology modernization, and above all, by making it possible to study the micro-and nanolevels of biological structures. On the other hand, the miniaturization of technological devices has increased the need to understand the tribological phenomena on micro-and nanolevel, where is a huge potential for technological innovation. The integration of advanced research methods made it possible to discover new aspects in the structure and properties of biological materials and transfer that knowledge into new concepts or products. State-of-the-art of biomimetics progress is discussed, as well as, its goals and the potential to simultaneously achieve the financial and ecological contribution by realization of bio-inspired concepts. An overview of biomimetic researches is also provided, with special emphasis on the possibility of their tribological applications. The characteristic examples have been presented and those examples show how the structural and mechanical properties of the material were used as the basis for developing new creative solutions to solve the problem of friction in engineering applications.",Ivanović L.; Vencl A.; Stojanović B.; Marković B.,Journal,Tribology in Industry,2018-09-01,University of East Sarajevo;University of Belgrade;University of Kragujevac,Biomimetics ;  Biomimicry ;  Bionics ;  Friction ;  Nanotechnology ;  Tribology

Influence of original manufacturer's patent protection on technological innovation strategy of remanufacturing supply chain,"To improve the innovation of remanufacturing technology for enhancing the social recognition, the influence of original manufacturer's patent protection on technology innovation strategy of re-manufacturer was researched by using game theory. Based on the derivation of consumers demand function which included the level of technological innovation, the supply chain models which regarded to No-Technical-Innovation(NTI), no-patent-Technology-Innovation(TI) and Patent-Protect-Technology-Innovation(PTI) respectively were constructed and solved, and the performance of supply chain and the model preferences of members were analyzed in detail with theoretical analysis and numerical simulation methods. Our analysis showed that the level of technology innovation was always positively related to the cost savings of re-manufacturing and consumer's valuation of the re-manufactured products, the level of technology innovation under patent protection was lower than that without patent protection; when dealers carried out technology innovation, the original manufacturer's patent licensing fees were significantly higher and was negatively related to the R&D efficiency; the mode preference of re-manufacturer, green consumer and social welfare was, the preference of the original manufacturer was, and the preferences of the supply chain system as well as the general consumers depended on the valuation degree of re-products from consumers.",Zhu B.; Ma Z.; Wu N.; Leon W.,Journal,"Jisuanji Jicheng Zhizao Xitong/Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems, CIMS",2018-09-01,Jiangsu University;Cranfield University,Patent protection ;  Re-manufacturing supply chain ;  Stackelberg game ;  Technology innovation
Early Stage Venture Strategy and the Survival of Nascent Entrepreneurial Firms: A Sand Cone Model Approach,"Early stage firms often face conflicting pressures on where and how to prioritize their efforts. In this paper, we aim to shed light on the benefits of different competitive priorities, using a sand cone model of operations strategy specifically applied to the context of early stage new ventures. In particular, we examine the relationship between strategy and the survival of these nascent entrepreneurial firms using data from the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics II. We find that a competitive priority of serving customer needs is associated with a greater probability of survival in nascent ventures. Innovation and traditional marketing activities were not significantly related to survival. The paper concludes with implications for practitioners and future research.",Stock G.; McDermott C.; McDermott M.,Journal,IEEE Engineering Management Review,2018-09-01,Lally School of Management;University of Colorado at Colorado Springs,early stage ;  entrepreneurship ;  nascent ;  new venture ;  Sand cone model ;  strategy
A New Model of Human Needs as the Foundation for Innovation Management,"By dividing human needs into two dimensions: the Physiological vs. Psychological and Safety and Security Oriented vs. Stimulation and Growth Oriented dimensions, a new model of human needs has been developed. This model can be extended to classify collective organizational and societal needs. It can be used to develop effective motivators for the four major innovation process participants: the idea generator, the core development team, the supporter, and the adopter of the creative idea and related product and service. Sample motivators for different participants based have been introduced. However, due to the wide variety of technology, product, service, management, social, theoretical, ideological, and philosophical innovations, additional research will be needed to expand the applications to specific innovations to determine detailed motivators for the participants in order to achieve effective management of the innovation process by successfully implement the creative idea to generate large impacts. Validation and further research on the overall model is also required.",Yu O.,Journal,IEEE Engineering Management Review,2018-09-01,San Jose State University,
Modernized tools for streamlined genetic manipulation and comparative study of wild and diverse proteobacterial lineages,"Correlating the presence of bacteria and the genes they carry with aspects of plant and animal biology is rapidly outpacing the functional characterization of naturally occurring symbioses. A major barrier to mechanistic studies is the lack of tools for the efficient genetic manipulation of wild and diverse bacterial isolates. To address the need for improved molecular tools, we used a collection of proteobacterial isolates native to the zebrafish intestinal microbiota as a testbed to construct a series of modernized vectors that expedite genetic knock-in and knockout procedures across lineages. The innovations that we introduce enhance the flexibility of conventional genetic techniques, making it easier to manipulate many different bacterial isolates with a single set of tools. We developed alternative strategies for domestication-free conjugation, designed plasmids with customizable features, and streamlined allelic exchange using visual markers of homologous recombination. We demonstrate the potential of these tools through a comparative study of bacterial behavior within the zebrafish intestine. Live imaging of fluorescently tagged isolates revealed a spectrum of distinct population structures that differ in their biogeography and dominant growth mode (i.e., planktonic versus aggregated). Most striking, we observed divergent genotype-phenotype relationships: several isolates that are predicted by genomic analysis and in vitro assays to be capable of flagellar motility do not display this trait within living hosts. Together, the tools generated in this work provide a new resource for the functional characterization of wild and diverse bacterial lineages that will help speed the research pipeline from sequencing-based correlations to mechanistic underpinnings. IMPORTANCE A great challenge in microbiota research is the immense diversity of symbiotic bacteria with the capacity to impact the lives of plants and animals. Moving beyond correlative DNA sequencing-based studies to define the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which symbiotic bacteria influence the biology of their hosts is stalling because genetic manipulation of new and uncharacterized bacterial isolates remains slow and difficult with current genetic tools. Moreover, developing tools de novo is an arduous and time-consuming task and thus represents a significant barrier to progress. To address this problem, we developed a suite of engineering vectors that streamline conventional genetic techniques by improving postcon-jugation counterselection, modularity, and allelic exchange. Our modernized tools and step-by-step protocols will empower researchers to investigate the inner workings of both established and newly emerging models of bacterial symbiosis.",Wiles T.; Wall E.; Schlomann B.; Hay E.; Parthasarathy R.; Guillemin K.,Journal,mBio,2018-09-01,Canadian Institute for Advanced Research;University of Oregon,Allelic exchange ;  Bacterial genetics ;  Conjugation ;  Counterselection ;  Domestication ;  Genetic manipulation ;  Microbiome ;  Modular tools ;  Proteobacteria ;  Symbiosis ;  Tn7 ;  Zebrafish
Mechanistic understanding of single-cell behavior is essential for transformative advances in biomedicine,"Most current efforts to advance medical technology proceed along one of two tracks. The first is dedicated to the improvement of clinical tasks through the incremental refinement of medical instruments. The second comprises engineering endeavors to support basic science studies that often only remotely relate to human medicine. Here we survey emerging research approaches that aim to populate the sprawling frontier between these tracks. We focus on interdisciplinary single-live-cell techniques that have overcome limitations of traditional biological methods to successfully address vital questions about medically relevant cellular behavior. Most of the presented case studies are based on the controlled manipulation of nonadherent human immune cells using one or more micropipettes. The included studies have (i) examined one-on-one encounters of immune cells with real or model pathogens, (ii) assessed the physiological role of the expandable surface area of immune cells, and (iii) started to dissect the spatiotemporal organization of signaling processes within these cells. The unique aptitude of such single-live-cell studies to fill conspicuous gaps in our quantitative understanding of medically relevant cause-effect relationships provides a sound basis for new insights that will inform and drive future biomedical innovation.",Francis E.; Heinrich V.,Journal,Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine,2018-09-01,College of Engineering,Adhesion ;  Calcium ;  Chemotaxis ;  Host-pathogen ;  Immune cell ;  Micropipette ;  Neutrophil ;  Phagocytosis ;  Signaling ;  Single-cell
CAD of human resource configuration in project scheduling for construction engineering applications,"The critical path method is the primary technique for project scheduling in construction engineering. However, the development of enterprises outside Taiwan has recently encountered difficulties in personnel dispatch and human resource acquisition. The management of time schedules without the consideration of human resource configuration may cause enterprises to make unrealistic decisions. Hence, the problems of project scheduling with limited human resources have been increasingly attracting attention from construction enterprises. Based on limited human resource configuration, this study uses computer aided design tool with a linear programming method to conduct a project scheduling for the optimal model with minimized costs for construction engineering applications. We find that the programming trial balance can effectively solve the problem of limited human resource configuration and compute the lowest construction costs. Specifically, the lowest cost obtained from the programming solution is RMB 25,315,752, which is RMB 1,920,632 lower than that in the former solution without resource constraints. Further, the scheduling procedure obtained by using the shortest path method connects with the programming trial balance to resolve the problem by changing the decision variables and relevant data, whose connection is easier and more convenient than under the pure critical path method. Moreover, according to the idea of CDIO engineering education, allowing the students to participate in scientific research project and scientific and technological innovation activities of different levels and types, it improves students’ learning capacity, innovation capability, cooperation capability, and engineering practical ability.",Lin J.; Shen P.; Lee B.,Journal,Computer Applications in Engineering Education,2018-09-01,Feng Chia University;T.Y.

Contributions of green infrastructure to enhancing urban resilience,"After briefly reviewing key resilience engineering perspectives and summarising some green infrastructure (GI) tools, we present the contributions that GI can make to enhancing urban resilience and maintaining critical system functionality across complex integrated social–ecological and technical systems. We then examine five key challenges for the effective implementation of GI that include (1) standards; (2) regulation; (3) socio-economic factors; (4) financeability; and (5) innovation. We highlight ways in which these challenges are being dealt with around the world, particularly through the use of approaches that are both context appropriate and socially inclusive. Although progress surmounting these challenges has been made, more needs to be done to ensure that GI approaches are inclusive and appropriate and feature equally alongside more traditional ‘grey’ infrastructure in the future of urban resilience planning. This research was undertaken for the Resilience Shift initiative to shift the approach to resilience in practice for critical infrastructure sectors. The programme aims to help practitioners involved in critical infrastructure to make decisions differently, contributing to a safer and better world.",Staddon C.; Ward S.; De Vito L.; Zuniga-Teran A.; Gerlak A.; Schoeman Y.; Hart A.; Booth G.,Journal,Environment Systems and Decisions,2018-09-01,University of the West of England;Monash University;The University of Arizona;Arcadis,Appropriateness ;  Challenges ;  Green infrastructure ;  Inclusiveness ;  Resilience
"Additive Manufacturing for Health: State of the Art, Gaps and Needs, and Recommendations","Additive manufacturing (AM) involves using computer-controlled machines to fabricate three-dimensional (3D) structural and functional parts layer by layer. To date, ample AM application opportunities exist in the health field. Based on the outcomes at the 2016 National Science Foundation AM for Health workshop, this paper summarizes the current state, gaps and research needs, and recommendations related to AM for health, in particular, hard structure and medical product printing and soft construct bioprinting. Manufacturing-related knowledge gaps and needs mainly fall into the materials, design, process innovation, part characterization, and policy and education categories. Hard structures and medical products can be designed to integrate with tissues, and their gaps and needs are typically related to the material-process-property-functionality relationship. Bioprinting-specific gaps and needs include build material selection and construct design, printed construct preservation, process selection, scalability and modeling, bioprinting-induced cell injury management, postprinting tissue fusion and maturation, and printed construct evaluation. Research recommendations encompass aspects ranging from fundamental research support to development of suitable standards for clinical use of AM products and are summarized in terms of materials, design, process innovation, modeling, characterization, and policy and education. Hard structure and medical product-specific recommendations are mainly related to build materials and structure design. For bioprinting, recommendations are summarized based on preparation, bioprinting process, and postbioprinting treatment. Furthermore, a biomedical manufacturing landscape is proposed, the potential of bioprinting as transformative research is introduced, and manufacturing-related scientific challenges are listed.",Huang Y.; Schmid S.,Journal,"Journal of Manufacturing Science and Engineering, Transactions of the ASME",2018-09-01,Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering;University of Notre Dame;University of Florida,
Software Engineering Research and Industry: A Symbiotic Relationship to Foster Impact,"Software engineering is not only an increasingly challenging endeavor that goes beyond the intellectual capabilities of any single individual engineer but also an intensely human one. Tools and methods to develop software are employed by engineers of varied backgrounds within a large variety of organizations and application domains. As a result, the variation in challenges and practices in system requirements, architecture, and quality assurance is staggering. Human, domain, and organizational factors define the context within which software engineering methodologies and technologies are to be applied and therefore the context that research needs to account for, if it is to be impactful. This article provides an assessment of the current challenges faced by software engineering research in achieving its potential, a description of the root causes of such challenges, and a proposal for the field to move forward and become more impactful through collaborative research and innovation between public research and industry.

Designing a model for learning self-organized innovation network: Using embedded case studies,"Innovation is considered the advantage cause for the nations in creating wealth and access to the development. Different countries have specific plans and policies to promote innovation. One of the strategies to develop high-technologies and innovation is the innovation networks approach. These networks work based on collaboration and learning. In recent decade, a considerable emphasis has been placed on learning self-organized innovation networks in different researches; nevertheless, despite such affirmation, a gap does exist for studying ways of improving and explaining the exact effects and its prerequisites. This research aims to study such gap(s) in innovation networks. Embedded case studies have been used as research methodology in this research. Besides the semi-structured interviews, a questionnaire was distributed among1 Ahwaz Science and Technology Park firms. The model, then, was restudied among 232 information technology firms throughout seven provinces in Iran. In order to analyze the data, regression test and goodness of fit test of the structural equations modeling was conducted. According to the obtained results, various factors such as cooperation capabilities, network embeddedness and favorable environment have been found to be effective on the learning, self-organization and cooperation of the network. Self-organizing and learning capabilities of the network also have various effects on increasing the innovation output and effectiveness of the network.",Shayan A.; Elahi S.; Ghazinoory S.; Hoseini S.,Journal,Computers and Industrial Engineering,2018-09-01,Tarbiat Modares University,Embeddedness ;  Information technology ;  Innovation ;  Innovation network ;  Learning network ;  Self-organizing network
The future of risk assessment,"Risk assessment must evolve for addressing the existing and future challenges, and considering the new systems and innovations that have already arrived in our lives and that are coming ahead. In this paper, I swing on the rapid changes and innovations that the World that we live in is experiencing, and analyze them with respect to the challenges that these pose to the field of risk assessment. Digitalization brings opportunities but with it comes also the complexity of cyber-phyiscal systems. Climate change and extreme natural events are increasingly threatening our infrastructures; terrorist and malevolent threats are posing severe concerns for the security of our systems and lives. These sources of hazard are extremely uncertain and, thus, difficult to describe and model quantitatively. Some research and development directions that are emerging are presented and discussed, also considering the ever increasing computational capabilities and data availability. These include the use of simulation for accident scenario identification and exploration, the extension of risk assessment into the framework of resilience and business continuity, the reliance on data for dynamic and condition monitoring-based risk assessment, the safety and security assessment of cyber-physical systems. The paper is not a research work and not exactly a review or a state of the art work, but rather it offers a lookout on risk assessment, open to consideration and discussion, as it cannot pretend to give an absolute point of view nor to be complete in the issues addressed (and the related literature referenced to).",Zio E.,Journal,Reliability Engineering and System Safety,2018-09-01,Université Paris-Saclay;Politecnico di Milano,Business continuity ;  Condition monitoring-based risk assessment ;  Cyber-physical systems ;  Dynamic risk assessment ;  Resilience ;  Risk assessment ;  Safety and security assessment ;  Simulation

The effects of task instructions in crowdsourcing innovative ideas,"The existing literature offers conflicting advice regarding the types of task instructions that increase the quality of ideas during idea generation. Our research examines three types of task instructions: unbounded (participants are asked to generate any ideas they want), suggestive (participants are asked to propose ideas that improve current product benefits), and prohibitive (participants are asked to propose ideas that do not involve current product benefits). We explore the effectiveness of these three types of task instructions in a field study involving 6406 ideas from eYeka, a global crowdsourcing platform. As compared to unbounded task instructions, we find that suggestive task instructions are significantly related to lower idea originality, feasibility, and value. In addition, we find that idea originality and value are statistically equivalent for unbounded and prohibitive task instructions. Together, our results suggest that either unbounded or prohibitive task instructions should be used when crowdsourcing innovative ideas.",Gillier T.; Chaffois C.; Belkhouja M.; Roth Y.; Bayus B.,Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2018-09-01,UNC Kenan-Flagler Business School;Université Grenoble Alpes;Wiseed,Creativity ;  Crowdsourcing ;  Fixation ;  Idea generation ;  Problem formulation
Nanocellulose as a natural source for groundbreaking applications in materials science: Today's state,"Nanocelluloses are natural materials with at least one dimension in the nano-scale. They combine important cellulose properties with the features of nanomaterials and open new horizons for materials science and its applications. The field of nanocellulose materials is subdivided into three domains: biotechnologically produced bacterial nanocellulose hydrogels, mechanically delaminated cellulose nanofibers, and hydrolytically extracted cellulose nanocrystals. This review article describes today's state regarding the production, structural details, physicochemical properties, and innovative applications of these nanocelluloses. Promising technical applications including gels/foams, thickeners/stabilizers as well as reinforcing agents have been proposed and research from last five years indicates new potential for groundbreaking innovations in the areas of cosmetic products, wound dressings, drug carriers, medical implants, tissue engineering, food and composites.

"Role of public research institutes in national innovation systems in industrialized countries: The cases of Fraunhofer, NIST, CSIRO, AIST, and ITRI","Public Research Institutes (PRIs) were established for many reasons, such as to promote defence related research and health related research. Helping domestic industries remains one of the important missions for public research institutes even when the countries have industrialized and firms’ technological capabilities are high. PRIs aim to upgrade existing industries, especially SMEs, as well as spearheading new ones. They can conduct research to solve today's problems of existing industries and those of next generation technologies which might lead to creation of new industries. Moreover, relationship between PRIs and firms and non-firm actors like universities became more intense, open, horizontal, international, and longer term. To reduce risk and uncertainty inherent in research mentioned above, intermediary roles of PRIs are increasingly important. The emphasis and the ways PRIs help industry change over time and vary across countries as they are integral part of national innovation systems. This makes generalization difficult, but the experiences of five leading PRIs in Germany, Taiwan, Japan, Australia, and the US shows that, the balances between contract research vs. longer term research with own initiative, mobility of researchers vs. retaining core researchers, and competitive grants and funds from industry vs. block grants from government are important to keep PRIs relevant to industry needs and maintain research standards. The governance of PRIs is of particular importance to maintain proper balances.",Intarakumnerd P.; Goto A.,Journal,Research Policy,2018-09-01,National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies;The University of Tokyo,Industrialized countries ;  Intermediary ;  Knowledge transfer ;  National innovation systems ;  Public research institutes
Beyond Private and Public Research: The Legal and Organizational Reality Behind Industrial Research Institutes in Interwar France,"The initiatives attempting to forge links between the academia and the industry flourished in France after World War I. The so-called “industrial institutes” shared a common goal: to reinvigorate the French economy through science. Because of their focus on applied research, they differed from traditional engineering schools that usually neglected laboratory work and innovation. However, while the industrial institutes were a distinct category that shows broader trends in science-industry relations, from a formal point of view they did not constitute a coherent category. The term “institute” was ambiguous and applied to various legal and administrative arrangements. While the French state attempted to unify terminology by introducing “faculty institutes” through the 1920 Decree on the constitution of universities, the measure was not sufficient to englobe all types of institutions. The diversity of organizational realities behind the industrial institutes is, however, useful for analyzing power structures and hierarchies in a given industrial sector. The legal form of an industrial institute was conditioned by the state and the robustness of the industry that funded it. As such, the history of the French industrial institutes may constitute a fertile ground for broader analyses on the impact of power relations on the legal reality behind the initiatives uniting science and industry.",Krasnodębski M.,Journal,Minerva,2018-09-01,Université de Bordeaux,Coal ;  Industrial research ;  Interwar France ;  Optics ;  Resin ;  Science policy

Investigating best practices of district-wide physical activity programmatic efforts in US schools- a mixed-methods approach,"Background: The majority of US children do not meet physical activity recommendations. Schools are an important environment for promoting physical activity in children, yet most school districts do not offer enough physical activity opportunities to meet recommendations. This study aimed to identify school districts across the country that demonstrated exemplary efforts to provide students with many physical activity opportunities and to understand the factors that facilitated their programmatic success. Methods: A total of 59 districts were identified as model districts by members of the Physical Activity and Health Innovation Collaborative, an ad hoc activity associated with the Roundtable on Obesity Solutions at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with consenting stakeholders from 23 school districts to understand physical education and activity efforts and elucidate factors that led to the success of these districts' physical activity programming. Districts were geographically and socioeconomically diverse and varied in their administrative and funding structure. Results: Most districts did not offer the recommended 150 or 225 min of physical activity a week through physical education alone; yet all districts offered a range of programs outside of physical education that provided additional opportunities for students to be physically active. The average number of school-based physical activity programs offered was 5.5, 3.5 and 2.1 for elementary, middle and high schools, respectively. Three overarching and broadly relevant themes were identified that were associated with successfully enhancing physical activity opportunities for students: soliciting and maintaining the support of champions, securing funding and/or tangible support, and fostering bi-directional partnerships between the district and community organizations and programs. Not only were these three themes critical for the development of physical activity opportunities, but they also remained important for the implementation, evaluation and sustainability of programs. These themes also did not differ substantially by the socioeconomic status of districts. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the success of school districts across the nation in providing ample opportunities for physical activity despite considerable variability in socioeconomic status and resources. These results can inform future research and provide actionable evidence for school districts to enhance physical activity opportunities to students.",Economos C.; Mueller M.; Schultz N.; Gervis J.; Miller G.; Pate R.,Journal,BMC Public Health,2018-08-30,Tufts University;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;University of South Carolina,Best practices ;  Physical activity ;  Policies and programs ;  Schools

Sustainability-oriented service innovation: An emerging research field,"Current environmental, social and economic sustainability challenges are increasingly becoming sources of motivation for both manufacturing and service companies when attempting to innovate their businesses. In recent years, there has been growing interest from academics, policy-makers and practitioners on service innovation as a new business logic for companies to address societal challenges regarding sustainability. Nevertheless, research specifically focusing on service innovation in relation to sustainability is scarce and ultimately scattered across different research fields. Thereby, only limited clues are available for companies willing to address sustainability challenges through service innovation. To encourage further research in this direction, this paper systematically reviewed the available literature by investigating peer-reviewed publications (from 2004 up to and including 2015) across different fields, which jointly focus on services, innovation and sustainability. The literature review confirmed both the growing amount of research on service innovation in relation to sustainability, as well as the lack of an overarching field to clearly identify such a phenomenon. The review also revealed that three main existing research streams (service innovation, product-service system and sustainability-oriented innovation) contribute to the investigation topic, though all have specific focuses when it comes to the sustainability and innovation dimensions considered. Taking stock of the descriptive and thematic analysis of the review and the identified research gaps, the paper concludes by discussing the need for a clear recognition of the emerging field of sustainability-oriented service innovation, and by outlining several future research pathways for its further enhancement.",Calabrese A.; Castaldi C.; Forte G.; Levialdi N.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2018-08-20,"Technische Universiteit Eindhoven;Università degli Studi di Roma ""Tor Vergata""",Product-service system (PSS) ;  Service innovation ;  Services ;  Sustainability ;  Sustainability-oriented innovation (SOI) ;  Sustainable innovation
Challenges in developing collaborative interdisciplinary research between gastroenterologists and engineers,"The role of technology in healthcare is rapidly evolving.

Corporate Venture Management in Small-Medium Sized Enterprise,"Corporate venturing is one way for corporations to introduce strategic renewal into their business portfolios, which is imperative for ongoing success in innovation-driven industries. Prior research finds that corporate ventures should be separated from the mainstream business in loosely coupled sub-units, but scholars continue to discuss how loose or tight the ventures should be to balance exploration and exploitation. Hence, the antecedents for successful venture management are yet to be fully explored and our study contributes to this effort. The study shows that corporate venture success is enhanced when corporate management grants job and strategic autonomy to the venture managers. This is further amplified when corporate management simultaneously imposes an exploitative policy that forces venture managers to prioritize extensions to and improvements of existing competences and product-market offerings.",Gard J.; Katzy B.; Andersen T.; Baltes G.; Gasser T.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2018 - Proceedings",2018-08-13,Copenhagen Business School;Universiteit Leiden;Hochschule Konstanz University of Applied Sciences,autonomy ;  corporate policy ;  corporate ventures ;  corporation-venture relations ;  organiztational ambidexterity

Creation of a Digital Business Model Builder,"Digitization forces industries to adapt to changing market conditions and consumer behavior. Exponential advances in technology, increased consumer power and sharpened competition imply that companies are facing the menace of commoditization. To sustainably succeed in the market, obsolete business models have to be adapted and new business models can be developed. Differentiation and unique selling propositions through innovation as well as holistic stakeholder engagement help companies to master the transformation. To enable companies and start-ups facing the implications of digital change, a tool was created and designed specifically for this demand: the Business Model Builder. This paper investigates the process of transforming the Business Model Builder into a software-supported digitized version. The digital twin allows companies to simulate the iterative adjustment of business models to constantly changing market conditions as well as customer needs on an ongoing basis. The user can modify individual variables, understand interdependencies and see the impact on the result of the business case, i.e. earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) or economic value added (EVA). The simulation of a business models accordingly provides the opportunity to generate a dynamic view of the business model where any changes of input variables are considered in the result, the business case. Thus, functionality, feasibility and profitability of a business model can be reviewed, tested and validated in the digital simulation tool.",Rambow-Hoeschele K.; Nagl A.; Harrison D.; Wood B.; Bozem K.; Braun K.; Hoch P.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2018 - Proceedings",2018-08-13,Robert Bosch GmbH;Hochschule Aalen University of Applied Sciences;Glasgow Caledonian University;Bozem | Consulting Associates | Munich,Business Model Builder ;  business model development ;  business model innovation ;  digital twin ;  simulation tool
A Comparative Study of Soft Skills Amongst the Washington Accord Engineering Degree Graduates with Industry Expectations,"Graduate engineers in the 21st century are expected to be well rounded engineers after graduating with a Washington accord degree. Academics and industry concur that engineers need to have a set of soft skills in the 21st century. Competence in soft skills may equally have a great influence over an engineer's general career achievement as hard skills competences. The purpose of this study is to investigate the magnitude to which the gap between Washington accord engineering degrees offer and industry expectations. The study found that graduate engineers with a Washington accord (WA) degree are taught the following soft skills; communication skills, teamwork, entrepreneurial skills, problem solving skills, decision making, ethic, self management skills, life long learning, and creativity/innovation. In contrast, industry found that graduate engineers are competent in the following soft skills; interpersonal skills, flexibility, teamwork, decision making skills, problem solving skills, and self management skills. Moreover, the result revealed that graduate engineers are taught the following soft skills; communication skills, ethics, and entrepreneurial skills but were not inline with industry expectations. The findings suggest that by revising the engineering curricula, it may be able to produce engineering graduates who are more prepared to meet industry expectations.",Wilson T.; Marnewick A.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2018 - Proceedings",2018-08-13,University of Johannesburg,graduate engineers ;  industry ;  Soft skills ;  Washington Accord
The Effectiveness of Finance Mobilization by Business Incubators on the Performance of NTBFs,"This paper develops a construct to evaluate the effectiveness of the finance mobilization provided by business incubators concerning the performance of new technology-based firms. In particular, we focus on the innovation strategy. The newness and smallness in NTBFs restrict the firms to raise capital in a proper time. Thus, the new firms attempt to join the BIs to increase their chance of having access to financial resources. The action supplied by BIs is called finance mobilization. The intriguing question is: To what extent is the finance mobilization by BIs effective on the performance of NTBFs? Currently, there is a scarcity of studies on this topic. Our effort in this article is to operationalize finance mobilization activities based on empirical findings discussed in the literature. The study integrates the operationalized activities into a theoretical model that will be tested in practice. The model contributes to the resource-based theory where we consider the capability of NTBFs in utilizing support and offering resources by business incubators. Our model explains the criteria that enable managers of business incubators to evaluate their performance in order to provide more effective support for their tenants.",Samaeemofrad N.; Van Den Herik J.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2018 - Proceedings",2018-08-13,Universiteit Leiden,Business Incubators ;  Capability ;  Finance Mobilization ;  Innovation Strategy ;  New Technology-Based Firms ;  Performance

An Analysis of Star Scientists in Japan,"Star scientists not only create an academic impact, but also induce a social impact such as creating new businesses through high-quality research outcomes. In comparison with the US, star scientists in Japan receive relatively less attention. This paper selects star scientists in Japan via Clarivate's list of High Cited Researchers and analyzes the characteristics of them connecting with J-global. We found that star scientists tend to be concentrated in specific universities/institutes in Japan. There are a few potential explanations. First, researchers in Japan tend to perform collaborative research within universities or institutes. Second, labor mobility is low within Japanese universities. Third, apprenticeship relations in Japan often last for a lifetime.",Nagane H.; Fukudome Y.; Maki K.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2018 - Proceedings",2018-08-13,Waseda Business School;Keio University;Chiba University,Entrepreneurship ;  Innovation ;  Science and Technology Policy ;  Star Scientist
The Relation between Support by Business Incubators and Performance of NTBFs,"This paper develops a construct to evaluate the effectiveness of the support provided by business incubators on the performance of new technology-based firms, and in particular, on the innovation strategy. Previous studies revealed that business incubators support NTBFs through the following activities: (1) access to networks, (2) monitoring, (3) knowledge development and dissemination, (4) finance and administrative mobilization, and (5) creation of exposure. However, there is still a scarcity of studies on the effectiveness of the support by business incubators on the performance of NTBFs. Our effort is to operationalize knowledge development and dissemination activities based on empirical findings discussed in the literature. The study integrates the operationalized activities into a theoretical model that will be tested in practice.

Applying Service Design Method to Technology Transfer Process: A Pilot Study,"Recently, technological innovation is a critical element for a country's economic growth. Also, the role of university transfers from educational provider to 'entrepreneurial university'. Thus, the university starts to play the role as one to make technology commercialization in terms of technology transfer. Most of the previous research focuses on the economic and social perspective to analyze the contribution of technology commercialization. Due to many key stakeholders and influential factors involving in the whole process, which were seldom taken into account in the research, this research tries to analyze the process from the service design perspective. The aim of the research is to figure out the main factors to change the technology transfer process from passive to active. During observation and interview, the authors discovered that in addition to improving the process by changing the original one, other influential factors such as the employees' interests, regulations of technology transfer, and executors' mindsets of achieving the goals are essential to promote transferring technology to an ideal status and level.",Liu C.; Hou M.; Chen C.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2018 - Proceedings",2018-08-13,National Cheng Kung University,contexual design ;  entreprenur university ;  service blueprint ;  service design ;  technology transfer
The Growing Importance of Technology Executives / Hidden Chief Technology Officers and Their Organizational Roles,"This paper is dedicated to the technology management issue in the context of increasing requirements and challenges that modern executives have to face regarding efficient and proactive technology and innovation management, promotion, and business development. The main focus of this research is the diversity of organizational roles performed by top and middle managers experiencing a strong impact of the 'technological factor'. Those executives who officially occupy the highest position associated with the technology responsibilities are Chief Technology Officers (CTOs). However, in many companies - especially in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) - such a position is not officially given. The managers who partially or fully perform the CTO functionality even if they do not have this official post can be called 'Hidden' CTOs. The literature review on the CTO functions and roles leads to a new approach to the CTO analysis. This new approach was used as the framework for the present empirical study. Based on a semistructured questionnaire and personal interviews, the roles of executives with a technological focus were investigated.",Lohmuller B.; Petrikhin A.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2018 - Proceedings",2018-08-13,Steinbeis-Hochschule-Berlin,'Hidden' CTO ;  and support ;  CTO ;  innovations development ;  organizational roles ;  promotion
External Knowledge Absorption in SMEs,"External knowledge plays important roles in firms' internal innovation activities. Firms need to develop absorptive capabilities and carefully manage the knowledge absorbing processes to better benefit from external knowledge. This study adopted a qualitative approach to investigate how Chinese SMEs absorb external knowledge. We examined how external knowledge is recognized, assimilated, utilized in a sample of 16 SMEs, and what barriers they may face when absorbing external knowledge.

The Involvement of San Diego-Based Star Scientists in Firm Activities,"Some star scientists carry out applied basic research and cooperate with companies to produce both articles and patents, while others concentrate on pure basic research to produce articles. The involvement of star scientists in corporate activities is an important factor in fostering an innovation ecosystem through which academic knowledge can be transferred to companies, and bring about innovation. This paper investigates the ways in which star scientists are involved with firms, with a focus on the San Diego region. We observed that, within the region, some star scientists who are hyperactive in the publication of articles and inactive in patenting were involved with a company as its co-founder.",Sumikura K.; Sugai N.; Maki K.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2018 - Proceedings",2018-08-13,Waseda Business School;National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies;Keio University,Innovation ;  Patent ;  Science and Technology Policy ;  Star Scientist
Six Principles for Successful Data-Driven Service Innovation in Industrial Companies,"Data-driven services play an important role in innovative business models of successful manufacturing companies: They hold great potential for the creation of unique selling points and improve the differentiation of manufacturing companies in highly competitive markets. However, the large number of newly invented digital services that fail shortly after launching implies that companies struggle with the invention and implementation of data-driven service solutions, which ends in a waste of resources. The following paper introduces guideline principles for successful innovation processes for data-driven services. The principles were identified during in-depth case studies with manufacturing companies. They contribute to a necessary paradigm change for manufacturing companies in terms of data-driven services for machines. The six identified principles emphasize new aspects regarding the new dimension of data-driven solutions and improve the life cycle management of products and services. They demonstrate how the rules of agile development can lead to successful and more efficient service innovations in the industrial sector.",Kampker A.; Husmann M.; Harland T.; Jussen P.; Steinbauer M.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2018 - Proceedings",2018-08-13,Siemens AG;Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen,data-driven services ;  product service systems ;  service engineering ;  service innovation
The Business Experiments Navigator (BEN),"Early reduction of risks in a startup or an innovation project is highly important. Appropriate means for risk reduction, such as testing business models with different kinds of experiments exist. However, deciding what to test and how to select the right test, is challenging for many startups and innovation projects. This article presents the so-called Business Experiments Navigator (BEN), a toolkit to assist startup and innovation processes. It compliments other tools such as the Business Model Canvas or the Lean Startup process. The main contribution of BEN is to bridge the gap between the riskiest assumptions of a business model and the multitude of available testing techniques by providing assumption templates. The Business Experiments Navigator has been validated in several workshops. Results show that it creates awareness among the workshop participants that a business model is based on assumptions, which impose risks and need to be validated. Further, users of BEN were able to identify relevant assumptions and map different kinds of assumptions to appropriate testing techniques. The process applied in the workshops, as well as the assumption templates, helped the participants understand the main concepts and transfer their learnings, to their own business ideas.",Gutbrod M.; Munch J.; Tichy M.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2018 - Proceedings",2018-08-13,Hochschule Reutlingen;Universität Ulm,Business modeling ;  continuous experimentation ;  continuous innovation ;  entrepreneurship ;  innovation ;  lean startup ;  product management ;  startups
Adoption of Factory of the Future Technologies,"One of the main innovation potentials to maintain the long-term competitive advantages of the manufacturing sector in high-wage countries is the adoption and implementation of Factory of the Future technologies. Different types of existing Industry 4.0 maturity models open up opportunities of defining the company's strategic position - an important starting point. The presented impact indicator system extends those models to support the path towards the Factory of the Future. Its starting point is a qualitative evaluation of critical success factors, which allows a company to derive measures to utilize the company's innovation potential.

Application of the UX-FFE Model for Optimizing the Performance of the Upstream Innovation Process,"The ability to successfully conduct radical innovation is mandatory for mature industrial companies that want to remain competitive on the global market. This ability relies on several ingredients, namely: (1) the structuring of the innovation process; (2) managerial principles; (3) methodological tools; (4) the presence of a culture of innovation. This paper reports about the impact of applying the UX-FFE model, which brings together the systemic innovation process with the social, economical and methodological aspects, on the outcomes of the innovation process. Firstly, the findings unveil a different quality of the social context between a group of co-creators addressing an incremental innovation and one-another targeting a radical innovation. Secondly, it appears that the operational performance of the upstream innovation process relies on the quality of the social context, intrinsic to the group of co-creators, corresponding to the reported perceived experience. Thirdly, the UX-FFE model application, as a consequence, allows optimizing the upstream innovation process performance. Indeed, we argue that the evaluation of the co-creators perceived experience brings new opportunities to optimize the operational performance of the upstream innovation process.",Lecossier A.; Pallot M.; Crubleau P.; Richir S.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2018 - Proceedings",2018-08-13,LAMPA Laboratoire Angevin de Mécanique Procédés et Innovation,Front End Innovation ;  Fuzzy Front End ;  Ideation ;  Innovation management ;  Optimization ;  User eXperience ;  UX-FFE

Adoption of Additive Manufacturing Approaches: The Case of Manufacturing SMEs,"The paper examines the use of case study analysis of additive manufacturing implementation within small and medium enterprises (SME). Many of the manufacturing enterprises are subjected to lot of disruptive and changing landscape over the years. The current expectations of the new changing markets are shorter product cycles and fulfilling better customization within the produce lines. This allows the entry of Additive Manufacturing (AM) application within many of the product based manufacturing enterprises. AM adopts the process of joining materials through layers to produce objects through 3D digital data technology that enables it to innovate the traditional manufacturing processes. The paper aims to present an overview of additive manufacturing technology through small and medium enterprise adoption by conducting three mini case studies within manufacturing businesses. The paper aims to investigate how additive manufacturing drives innovation within these manufacturing SMEs and while understanding the adoption of these technological advances, proposes an appropriate implementation framework. The study also aims to evaluate any tactical patterns of innovation and growth towards the adoption and advantages of additive manufacturing, while recommending solutions to address certain challenges, especially within the supply chain transformation within the environment.

Teaching Design in Europe: Challenges and Trends,"Design has recently gained much attention among practitioners and scholars as a source of innovation. Firms are increasingly investing in design and involving design firms in their innovation processes. This research is based on an ongoing research project that consists in a complete range of training courses focused on design and has the objective to discover how design-driven innovation can become the key to improve European SMEs competitiveness, efficiency and sustainability. In the meanwhile, focusing on the project data, the main aim of the paper is to take a picture of the trends at European level with respect to the main design phases, looking at the modules proposed by the course. Accordingly, this work will allow understanding which is the knowledge (in terms of design) most requested by European SMEs. In order to perform a first complete analysis, we focus on hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), which is a statistical method able to build a hierarchy of clusters. The goal of the statistical analysis is to try to discover some hidden patterns existing in the dataset, which connect Modules and Countries, in order to understand if some specific relationships exist.",Pinna C.; Cattaneo L.; Rossi M.; Dell Era C.; Terzi S.; Pestarino A.; Vignati A.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2018 - Proceedings",2018-08-13,Politecnico di Milano;RINA Consulting S.p.A.,design ;  design for competitiveness ;  European design trend
Intellectual Property Protection of 3D Print Supply Chain with Blockchain Technology,"Within 'Industrie 4.0' approach 3D printing technology is characterized as one of the disruptive innovations. Conventional supply chains are replaced by value-added networks. The spatially distributed development of printed components, e.g. for the rapid delivery of spare parts, creates a new challenge when differentiating between 'original part', 'copy' or 'counterfeit' becomes necessary. This is especially true for safety-critical products. Based on these changes classic branded products adopt the characteristics of licensing models as we know them in the areas of software and digital media. This paper describes the use of digital rights management as a key technology for the successful transition to Additive Manufacturing methods and a key for its commercial implementation and the prevention of intellectual property theft. Risks will be identified along the process chain and solution concepts are presented.

Framing a Smart Service with Living Lab Approach: A Case of Introducing Mobile Service Within 4G for Smart Tourism in Taiwan,"Since constructing a smart city has become a new infrastructure in modern cities. How service providers could frame a successful smart service to encourage the transactions with the users is a critically practical challenge. On the open innovation perspective, framing a smart service with living lab approach could make the service smartize through a real context. A case of Taiwan is illustrated in this study which the government intends to introduce ICT and IOT technologies to frame an STD service in five Hakka towns, such as beacons, a mobile app, and a website by living lab approach. In the case, we monitor the interactions between the technology, users, and business, and attempt to understand how new services work from service performance measuring. The results show a low adoption even if the service is familiar with user's context. Observing the case on a proposed model, we found that the tourist service spins in and smartize, but the smart technology could not spin out and reshape with the behaviors of the stakeholders, such as the fail on the integration with current business, insufficient consideration on the technology acceptance, and so on. These findings indicated fail to make both inbound and outbound synergies with the three elements may lead an unsuccessful implementation of new smart service.",Tsai-Lin T.; Chang Y.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2018 - Proceedings",2018-08-13,National United University Taiwan,IOT technologies ;  Living Lab ;  Open innovation ;  Smart city ;  Smart service ;  Smart tourism
Service Innovation Blocks,"One overarching opportunity in the digitized economy is to develop new services at the highest efficiency in order to solve urgent problems in an entire different way. These services drive the digital transformation and the speed in innovation is crucial to take advantage of the opportunities. In order to succeed, innovation teams need orientation and guidelines when applying the vast number of existing methods for service innovation. With the methodology illustrated in the paper, we enhance the existing body of research on various fields. First, we propose a classification scheme, which encompasses the variety of methods available to innovators and we structure these methods along four higher order innovation tasks: Exploration, Evaluation, Development and Realization. We further identified specific patterns, which describe different paths through the methodology. From a practical perspective, the overall objective of this research is to increase the efficiency of the innovation process.

Identifying Barriers to Intrapreneurship,"Intrapreneurship became a research topic of wide academic interest in recent times. Building upon previous work that focused on single aspects or influence factors that impact the success of intrapreneurial activities, this paper suggests a holistic systems theory-based approach to assess possible barriers of intrapreneurship in organizations. After an outline of previous work on intrapreneurship in general and possible related threads and risk specifically, an adapted sensitivity analysis method of Vester (2000) is applied to develop a draft model of interconnected influence factors for intrapreneurial activities in organizations. This conceptual model should serve as a basis for further empirical research on the subject and supports the understanding of interdependencies between variables in an organizational system. In accordance with findings from analyzing the literature, the application of the method to a single-case study suggests that possible barriers to intrapreneurship can be a lack of skills, creativity, knowledge or motivation of employees to act as intrapreneurs on the individual level; the organizational culture, its management, the provided working environment and a lack of agility and rule breaking tolerance on the organizational level as well as the current market situation. Future research could make use of this approach and empirically validate the results or extend them through comparative studies of successful and unsuccessful intrapreneurial activities. It could be further enhanced through semantic modelling to illustrate and capture the network of interdependencies.",Reuther K.; Borodzicz E.; Schumann C.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2018 - Proceedings",2018-08-13,"University of the West of Scotland, School of Business & Creative Industries;Faculty of Economic Sciences",Corporate Entrepreneurship ;  Innovation ;  Intrapreneurship ;  Risk ;  Systems Theory
How Corporate Accelerators Foster Organizational Transformation: An Internal Perspective,"Corporate venturing has gained much attention due to challenges and changes that occur because of discontinuous innovations - which seem to be promoted by digitalization. In this context, open innovation has become a promising tool for established companies to strengthen their innovation capabilities. While the external opening of the innovation process has gained much attention, the internal opening lacks on investigations. Especially new organizational forms, such as Internal Corporate Accelerators, have not been investigated sufficiently. This study, which is based on 13 interviews from two German tech-companies, contributes to a better understanding of this new form of corporate venturing and the resulting effects on the organizational renewal.",Selig C.; Gasser T.; Baltes G.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2018 - Proceedings",2018-08-13,Hochschule Konstanz University of Applied Sciences,corporate entrepreneurship ;  corporate venturing ;  dynamic capabilities ;  internal corporate accelerator ;  open innovation
Drivers of Reverse Innovation: Some insights gained from case studies,"The term reverse innovation describes innovations which started their development in emerging economies and spread into developed economies. This phenomena has long been identified and describes the opposite to the prevailing and traditional view of internationalization of products, which are invented in developed economies and find their way into emerging economies. Some Multi-National Companies use this phenomena to foster their own innovations across the globe. A plenty of reasons for reverse innovation to happen have been identified. A clear view on essential drivers for such innovation is however still lacking. Through the introduction and discussion of three case studies which describe reverse innovations by firms in emerging economies it is envisaged to contribute to the formation of an explanation of this phenomena and its drivers. The three cases stem from India, Kenya and South Africa, and are fairly heterogeneous in terms of the invented product. However the analysis of the cases and looking for common factors, including and in particular external factors, is deemed to enrich the existing picture of reverse innovation. The aim of the presented study was hence to contribute to the formation of a common understanding of the phenomena and its external factors. The limitation of this approach is fully acknowledge since only a small case number is looked at. However some commonalities appear in the analysis of the cases and might worthwhile following up on.",Martin L.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2018 - Proceedings",2018-08-13,Hochschule Pforzheim,emerging economies ;  internationalization ;  start-ups
'Grey-Box' and 'Black-Box' Supplier-Buyer Relationship in Product Innovation under Technology and Market Uncertainty,"The objective of this research study is to examine the effect of external uncertainty and supplier-buyer relationship conditions on supplier involvement in product innovation processes. A research model is proposed to investigate the connection between technology and market uncertainty, supplier-buyer relationships, supplier integration outcomes, and the role of black-box and grey-box integration. Data from high-tech companies were used to analyze the proposed hypotheses through PLS-SEM. The results reveal technology and market uncertainty are significant to supplier-buyer cooperation. Suppliers and buyers tend to work more intensively when technology and market uncertainty is high. Supplier-buyer relationship impacts supplier involvement outcomes, and this collaboration is more effective when black-box integration form is selected in the product innovation process. This research paper contributes to supplier involvement in product innovation literature by unfolding how firms can integrate suppliers under technology and market uncertainty and black-box and grey-box integration under product innovation projects.",Incekara M.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2018 - Proceedings",2018-08-13,Pamukkale Üniversitesi,Black-Box Integration ;  Grey-Box Integration ;  Market Uncertainty ;  PLS-SEM ;  Product Innovation Technology Uncertainty ;  SEM ;  Supplier-Buyer Relationships
Resource and Competence (Internal) View vs. Environment and Market (External) View When Defining a Business,"Startups is a popular phenomenon that has a significant impact on global economy growth, innovation and society development. However, there is still insufficient understanding about startups, particularly, how to start a new business in the relation to consequent performance. Toward this knowledge, we have performed an empirical study regarding the differences between a Resource and Competence View (Internal) vs Environment and Market View (External) when defining a Business. 701 entrepreneurs have reflected on their startups on nine classes of Resources (values, vision, personal objectives, employees and partners, buildings and rental contracts, cash and credit, patents, IPR's and brands, products and services and finally revenues and grants) and three elements of the Business Mission ('KeyContribution', 'KeyMarket' and 'Distinction'). It seems to be a tendency to favour the Internal View over the External View. This tendency is clearer in Stable Economies (Europe) than in Emerging Economies (South Africa). There seems to be a co-variation between the tendency to favour the Internal View and the tendency to focus on adding Resources. Finally, we found that an order-based analysis seems to explain the differences between the two views better than a number-based method.",Dahle Y.; Duc A.; Steinert M.; Chizhevskiy R.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2018 - Proceedings",2018-08-13,University of South-Eastern Norway;Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet;Lean Business AS,Big Data ;  Business Idea ;  Business Mission ;  Data Warehouse ;  Distinction ;  Environmental Models of Competitive Advantage ;  External View ;  Internal View ;  Key Contribution ;  Key Market ;  Knowledge Based Model ;  Lean Startup ;  Market Based Model ;  Resource Based Model
Towards Strategic Action Planning: Using a Collaboration Maturity Model to Support International Co-Operation in Research and Innovation,"With the challenge to improve international co-operation in the area of raw materials research and innovation, especially between Europe and selected reference countries, the team of the INTRAW project came across several challenges. One of the challenges of the project consisted in the fact that action planning on collaboration could not sensibly be carried out without first categorizing the current state of collaboration as well as setting objectives on the state of collaboration envisioned. Existing approaches were not directly applicable in the context of international Cooperative Support Action (CSA) planning addressing both company and policy level. Thus, considering the limitations of existing approaches and based on the capability maturity model integration (CMMI) approach, a generic and practical model was set-up to categorize the collaboration maturity already existing in companies, sectors and regions. This model allows categorization of the status as well as envisioned collaboration maturities related to single actions. The underlying methodology as well as the collaboration maturity model will both be described in more detail in this paper illustrated by reference to insights from the INTRAW project.",Schimpf S.; Christo N.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2018 - Proceedings",2018-08-13,Universität Stuttgart;ASSIMAGRA - Mineral Resources of Portugal,collaboration maturity model ;  research and Innovation ;  strategic action planning
Applying Entrepreneurial Teaching Methods to Advanced Technical STEM Courses,"A vast majority of Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) courses and pedagogical frameworks concentrate on teaching the fundamental concepts and theoretical underpinnings of the tools related to the subject. While this aspect is important, we recognize that the teaching methods in a majority of the STEM courses today are broken; there is a major discrepancy between the skills and mindsets in technical classes and the ones that are useful to solve actual problems in 'the real world'. Therefore, we suggest a new teaching framework called Data-X where entrepreneurial teaching methods developed in the Berkeley Method of Entrepreneurship are applied to advanced technical topics. Through inductive learning and by practicing story creation, stakeholder generation, adaptation, ideation, innovation processes, and by having a diverse mix of students being coached by a network of expert advisors, this highly applied teaching method empowers students to pursue and find solutions to open-ended projects and problems. The Data-X framework has been implemented and tested for three semesters in a UC Berkeley course called Applied Data Science for Venture Applications. In the class the students pick up, become comfortable, and utilize state-of-the-art tools in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. The results, feedback, and testimonials we have received upon offering the class have been overwhelmingly positive, and we propose that the ideas and concepts behind Data-X can help fix many problems in modern STEM education.",Sidhu I.; Iqbal S.; Fred-Ojala A.; Johnsson C.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2018 - Proceedings",2018-08-13,"Lunds Universitet;University of California, Berkeley",data science ;  entrepreneurial mindsets ;  inductive learning ;  innovation processes ;  machine learning ;  pedagogical frameworks ;  STEM education ;  teaching methods
A Perspective for the Implementation of a Path Towards the Factory of the Future: The Italian Case,"This work presents a case study analysis aiming at depicting a perspective for the implementation of a path towards the Factory of the Future (FoF) and Industry 4.0 (14.0) in organizations of the Italian manufacturing value chain. Starting from the presentation and framing of related supporting initiatives at national and regional level and a review of current literature on digitalization of manufacturing, the paper analyses and discusses good and best practices along three specific dimensions: investments in FoF/14.0 technologies, ability in perceiving and facing the path towards FoF/14.0, knowledge transfer. A set of business cases addressing different actors of the manufacturing supply chain (large companies and SMEs, technology providers and research and innovation players) has been selected for investigating the challenges related to the implementation of the FoF/14.0 paradigm. The main contribution of this work relates to the identification of best practices highlighting enablers and barriers for the adoption of FoF/14.0 technologies based on a theoretical framework on three dimensions, which have to be considered in close connection for an integrated vision of the digital transformation path.",Zangiacomi A.; Sacco M.; Pessot E.; De Zan A.; Bertetti M.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2018 - Proceedings",2018-08-13,Università degli Studi di Udine;Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche;Technology Transfer Pordenone Technology Centre,Case studies ;  Factory of the Future ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Manufacturing ;  Value chain
The Networked Neighborhood,"Social community is a basic need of human life. Exchange, networking and cooperation are the driving forces for innovation and are at the same time essential for the accomplishment of everyday life. Since the foundation of Facebook in 2004, (digital) networking has been redefined and constantly reinvented. Research and science endeavor to describe the phenomena, to analyze them scientifically and to make the benefits of digital networking accessible to all. In that context this article presents first results of the evaluation of a quarter related networking platform. Objectives of the evaluation are the derivation of criteria for the implementation of neighborhood apps as well as the gain in knowledge about content satisfaction and the user-friendliness of the neighborhood app used in the project. First results show that there is a cross-generational interest in digital networking and that tools for neighborhood work and district communication make the use of a neighborhood platform attractive. Nevertheless, there is a certain inhibition to the usage due to the fear to do something wrong, additional work and the low added value in the initial phase due to low numbers of users.",Renyi M.; Gundogdu R.; Kunze C.; Gaugisch P.; Teuteberg F.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2018 - Proceedings",2018-08-13,Hochschule Furtwangen;Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Engineering IAO;Osnabrück University,evaluation ;  implementation research ;  networked neighborhood work ;  user-centered design
Designing Digital Workplace Environments,"For companies, knowledge is the central and decisive resource for success. Today, however, knowledge must flow more than ever before in order to meet the requirements of shorter innovation cycles and an increasingly agile working environment. The distribution and generation of knowledge requires a digital workplace environment that facilitates communication and collaboration between employees and their environment. The digital workplace acts as both a technical enabler and an attractive feature, thus making a major contribution to organizational performance and recruiting, retaining and motivating staff. Such an infrastructure, which connects users, makes them capable of working ubiquitously. Due to the complexity and ambiguities of such an endeavour it can only be rolled out and developed on an ongoing basis in close interaction with users. Therefore, this contribution proposes an agile framework for large-scale end-user participation in developing digital workplace environments based on an agile design approach that actively and continuously involves employees.",Schmidt C.; Praeg C.; Gunther J.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2018 - Proceedings",2018-08-13,Hochschule Heilbronn;Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Engineering IAO,agile ;  digital workplace ;  framework ;  KANO ;  large-scale ;  SCRUM ;  user participation
System Dynamics as a Tool for Data Driven Business Model Design in the Context of Autonomous Ride Hailing,"Despite the rapid growth of mobility services, high uncertainty remains about how business models should be composed in the future. Several pilot projects and multiple ride hailing services have already explored the opportunities of chauffeured ride hailing and thereby produced large amounts of data. However, it is unclear, whether the introduction of autonomous vehicles will change business models. In today's business design process, well established frameworks such as the business model canvas and business plan fail to adequately incorporate big amounts of data. This applies especially, when there is interaction between (opposing or self-amplifying) effects, so called causal loops. System Dynamics has been proven to be a useful tool to master complex problems mostly within the field of operations research and is increasingly used to solve macroeconomic problems since the early 2000s. To date, the methodology has not been applied to the business model strategy of mobility service providers. In this study, a model of the city of San Francisco has been created and calibrated to ride hailing providers Uber's and Lyft's transport statistics data. The simulation reproduces recorded data at an accuracy better than 10%. The model is subsequently extrapolated to explore business characteristics in an autonomous driving scenario. Key findings within the given scenario are an optimal vehicle range of 200 km, optimal charging speed of >25 kW. Further analysis shows the reduced importance of fleet utilization when autonomous driving is introduced. Consequently, the opportunities of market segmentation are explored. In this model, a mass market offering, addressing 50% of inner city mobility use cases, would yield a profit of 17 Mn EUR per year at a passenger price of 0,266 EUR/km. In comparison, an offering aimed only at the 10% of well-paying inner-city mobility use cases and users can make the same profit by selling to passengers at 0,755 EUR/km, even if this requires vehicles priced three times as high as in the former scenario.",Von Peinen A.; Bohmer A.; Lindemann U.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2018 - Proceedings",2018-08-13,Technische Universität München,Business Model Innovation ;  Data-Driven Decision Making ;  On-Demand Mobility ;  Simulation ;  System Dynamics
Brokering User Knowledge,Knowledge brokering is a key activity in innovation networks such as living labs. Previous research has acknowledged the multiple roles and tasks of intermediaries and brokers in managing living labs but has not paid attention to the nature of knowledge flow and the distance between the actors that are brokered. This study empirically examines how user knowledge is brokered in living labs as well as the living lab schemes among regional innovation organisers in Finland. Results show that user knowledge is mostly considered explicit knowledge and that users and developers meet rarely in a real-life environment. Brokering distances between stakeholders may be a useful approach in conducting living lab activities.,Konsti-Laakso S.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2018 - Proceedings",2018-08-13,LUT University,knowledge brokering ;  living lab ;  user knowledge
Multi-Sided Digital Manufacturing Platform Supporting Exchange of Unused Company Potential,"The come to power of the sharing economy paradigm has incentivized the adoption of service-based business models largely relying on digital platforms providing the infrastructure and the ecosystems to sustain market uptake. The manufacturing domain isn't exempted from this trend, witnessing the growing launch of digital platforms with the aim of shifting value proposition towards a model relying on product servitization and share, instead of ownership. Most of the current examples in this domain are very narrowed-scope systems that just connect business providers or, when giving detailed services, these are dedicated to very specific manufacturing sectors (few machining operations available, few materials, etc.). This conceptual paper presents an application and extension of the Digital Platform Model to manufacturing services across Europe. A digital platform, called MANU-SQUARE and aiming at becoming the reference one-stop shop for European manufacturing is envisioned. Provision of customized services that adapt to different users' needs in cross-sectorial domains and coverage of the whole spectrum of value chain activities are its key features. On top of basic services, MANU-SQUARE creates the ground for a self-reinforcing knowledge, innovation and services ecosystem that, by creating more touch points for involved third parties, is able to remix and re-bundle the components making up the offering over time.",Bettoni A.; Barni A.; Sorlini M.; Menato S.; Giorgetti P.; Landolfi G.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2018 - Proceedings",2018-08-13,Scuola Universitaria Professionale della Svizzera Italiana,digital platform ;  manufacturing as a service ;  multi-sided business models ;  resource-efficiency ;  servitisation

Future Educational Technology with Big Data and Learning Analytics,"In the recent years, big data and learning analytics have been emerging as fast-growing research fields. The application of these emerging research areas is gradually addressing the contemporary challenges of school and university education. Tracing out the information regarding students' misconceptions and dropping-out probabilities from the courses at the right instant of time, development of detectors of a range of educational importance and achieving the highest level of quality in the higher education are becoming more challenging. Moreover, providing well timed and the best suitable solutions to the students at-risk are even more strenuous. In this concept paper, we aim to address these contemporary challenges of school and the university education and their probable solutions by utilizing our research experiences of automated assessment, immediate feedback, learning analytics and the IT technologies. Solving such problems by knowing the history of students' activities, submissions, and the performances data is possible. The identification of students' misconceptions during the learning process, examining behavioral patterns and significant trends by efficiently aggregating and correlating the massive data, improving the state-of-the-art skills in creative thinking and innovation, and detecting the drop-outs on-time are highlighted in this article. We are aiming at extracting such knowledge so that adaptive and personalized learning will become a part of the current education system. Not only the available algorithm of supervised learning methods such as support vector machine, neural network, decision trees, discriminant analysis, and nearest neighborhood method but also new engineering and distillation of relevant data features can be carried out to solve these educational challenges.",Kanth R.; Laakso M.; Nevalainen P.; Heikkonen J.,Conference Proceeding,IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics,2018-08-10,Turun yliopisto,Big Data ;  Digital Social Research ;  Educational Technology ;  Learning Analytics

"Challenges of sustainability efforts of universities regarding the sustainable development goals: A case study in the University of Zanjan, Iran","The purpose of this presentation is to introduce some activities and programmes of the University of Zanjan in changing its campus environment towards a sustainable campus, emphasising setting and infrastructure, waste management, water management, and education and research. This comprehensive university with over 10000 students and 1000 staff is located in a semiarid area with a campus area of 421 ha and is 6 km away from the Zanjan City, center of Zanjan Province. In over four decades, it has expanded its tree cultivation to over 72 hectares, and its total vegetation area covers over 94 percent of total campus area. The university has increased and improved its investment on sustainability, smart buildings and water management in both buildings and vegetated areas. The waste management programmes have been implemented through using electronic correspondence and document submission in different activities of the university; separating plastics, glasses and papers and waste recycling; toxic waste handling in all labs; composting organic waste; inorganic waste management; and recycling sewage disposal. Though the university has provided free buses and shuttles to both staff and students inside the campus and between the city and campus to reduce private car use, it still needs to encourage bicycle use and improve its facilities to support it. Developing renewable energy for the future is still a challenge for this university and needs both innovation and investment. Students and academic staff have also been encouraged to move their conventional education and research methods and contents to more sustainable approaches, for example in courses syllabuses, student activities, research projects, publications and investments. The GreenMetric World University Ranking Network is expected to enhance its scope to contribute much more on sustainable development goals. A sustainable university should play an important role in innovation and technology research and development in sustainability; enhancing staff and students' sustainability knowledge and social capacities; changing the campus environment to an Ecofriendly and sustainable environment; and enhancing social and human capacities of communities and public and private institutions.",Najafian S.; Karamidehkordi E.,Conference Proceeding,E3S Web of Conferences,2018-08-08,University of Zanjan,

Li3xLa2/3–xTiO3 (x = 0.1–0.11) was synthesized by molten salt and solid-state reaction method. In brief, stoichiometric amounts of dried Li2CO3, La2O3, and TiO2 (Li:La: Ti = 1.1:1:2) were mixed thoroughly in ethanol, with a molar concentration of 4 mol L–1 followed by magnetic stirring for 30 min. Then a uniform paste was formed by adding chloride flux of LiCl into the solution. The R ratio, which is defined as the molar ratio between the flux and the LLTO, was controlled at 8. The paste was transferred into a ceramic crucible with a lid, fired at 300 °C for 3 h to remove water and crystal water; then the dried powder was fired at 800 °C for 4 h to decarbonate, followed by sintering at 1150 °C for 10 h. The samples were then cooled to room temperature. The final LLTO NPs were obtained by washing twice with deionized water to remove the flux and then dried in a vacuum oven overnight at 80 °C. Both the heating rate and cooling rate were 5 °C min–1. To consider the evaporation of lithium during the synthesis, the stoichiometry of Li2CO3 was 10% higher than the final composition. For the solid-state reaction, stoichiometric amounts of dried Li2CO3, La2O3 and TiO2 (Li:La:Ti = 1.1:1:2) were mixed thoroughly in ethanol and then sintered at 1350 °C for 12 h. To fabricate LLTO films, 3 wt% of LiCl and 97 wt% of LLTO NPs were mixed together and pressed into pellets (with a thickness of ≈8 μm), which was then soaked at 1100 °C for 12 h. Before fabricating the LLTO/Li anodes, a little electrolyte was used to clean the surface of the Li-metal in the glove box. After the evaporation of the electrolyte, three drops of toluene were dipped onto Li-metal surface, then pressed the thin LLTO film onto Li-metal with a force of 5 N for 3 h.” Herein, in the first sentence “and solid-state reaction” is added and the sentence later pertaining to the solid-state reaction: “For the solid-state reaction, stoichiometric amounts of dried Li2CO3, La2O3 and TiO2 (Li:La:Ti = 1.1:1:2) were mixed thoroughly in ethanol and then sintered at 1350 °C for 12 h.” is also added.

Study on the environmental innovation capability evaluation model of manufacturing enterprises based on entropy weight TOPSIS-BP neural network and empirical research,"In order to objectively and accurately evaluate the environmental innovation capability of manufacturing enterprises, this study establishes an evaluation indicator system of environmental innovation ability of manufacturing enterprises. We propose the evaluation model of environmental innovation capability of manufacturing enterprises based on the integrated learning algorithm which is entropy weight TOPSIS and BP neural network. First, the entropy weight method is employed to calculate the weighted index and comprehensive evaluation of environmental innovation capability of manufacturing enterprises by TOPSIS method. Then, the evaluation value is used as a priori sample for the training and testing of BP neural network. The environmental innovation ability of the manufacturing enterprises is analyzed and evaluated in a more comprehensive way. Furthermore, an empirical evaluation of the sixty enterprises in Heilongjiang Province is taken as the example to illustrate the feasibility of this method. And the environmental innovation capability of enterprises is comparatively analyzed. The validity of the prediction model was verified by comparing the proposed the entropy weight TOPSIS-BP neural network regression fitting algorithms. The results show that the evaluation results based on entropy weight TOPSIS-BP neural network model is more accurate and reliable than the existing methods. In addition, it provides theoretical suggestions for further improving the environmental innovation capability of manufacturing enterprises in China.",Xu J.; Sun Y.,Conference Proceeding,International Conference on Management Science and Engineering - Annual Conference Proceedings,2018-08-01,Harbin Engineering University,BP neural network ;  Entropy weight ;  Environmental innovation capability ;  Manufacturing enterprises ;  TOPSIS

Zoning method for well-facilitated farmland construction based on improvement of ecological services,"Improving the ecosystem service function and production function of cultivated land is the main objective of well-facilitated farmland construction, while well-facilitated farmland zoning and regulation design aimed to improve ecological service function is the fundamental premise for the effective implementation of ecological farmland construction. At present, the emphasis of well-facilitated farmland construction is to achieve the goal of good quality of cultivated land, centralized and continual cropland, infrastructure supporting, rational ecological landscape pattern and stable spatial distribution through engineering technology and other measures. On the basis of the existing goals, taking Yuzhong County, Gansu Province as a typical case, the paper tried to explore the theory and method of ecological farmland construction zoning in loess hilly region. Firstly, taking village as the basic research unit, based on InVEST model, the paper evaluated 4 different values of ecosystem services which are habitat quality, soil retention, carbon sequestration, and food supply. Then the paper analyzed the spatial differentiation of various types of ecosystem services, and found out the low-value ecosystem service types for each research unit. Secondly, the paper identified obstacle factors which affect regional ecosystem services, and divided them into controllable factors and un-controllable factors. Thirdly, through the relationship framework between well-facilitated farmland construction measures and ecosystem service functions, combined with the controllable obstacle factors, the construction directions of well-facilitated farmland in different regions are determined, as well as the measures of ecological well-facilitated farmland construction zoning and regulation. The main contribution of the paper is to discuss the relationship between well-facilitated farmland construction measures and ecosystem service functions, and to put forward a set of ideas and methods for delineating ecological well-facilitated farmland construction zoning based on ecosystem services evaluation. Results show that, Yuzhong County's ecosystem services have obvious spatial difference. Among them, the habitat quality shows a decreasing trend from southwest to northwest area. The spatial difference of soil erosion is large, which is controlled by topography and vegetation cover and other factors. The high value area is mainly distributed in the loess hilly area and the northwest area, and the low value area is mainly located in the southern mountainous area and the central valley basin area. Similar to the habitat quality, the spatial distribution of carbon sequestration services also shows spatial characteristics of decreasing from south to north. Because of the better soil and water conditions in the central valley basin, the spatial distribution of food supply services shows that it is low in the north and south mountains, and high in the central basin. On the basis of the spatial difference of ecosystem services and the identification of controllable obstacle factors, 4 zoning types of ecological well-facilitated farmland construction in Yuzhong are obtained, which are habitat quality improvement zone, food supply and carbon sequestration service promotion zone, habitat quality and carbon sequestration service promotion zone, and habitat quality, food supply and carbon sequestration service promotion zone. Corresponding regulation and control measures are put forward for different types of ecological well-facilitated farmland construction zoning. The construction division can effectively promote the ecological function of ""fields, water, roads and forests"", which is the effective mode to achieve the simultaneous improvement of ecological service functions and production, and it also can provide important basis for theoretical thinking and practical innovation of ecological civilization construction.",Liu C.; Wu Y.; Wang C.,Journal,Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering,2018-08-01,Northwest Normal University China;Gansu Engineering Research Center of Land Utilization and Comprehension Consolidation,Construction of well-facilitated farm land ;  Ecosystems ;  InVEST model ;  Regulation strategy ;  Zoning

Chemical engineering research synergies across scientific categories,"Chemical engineers operate industrial plants, design reactors and equipment, manage capital projects, estimate costs, project earnings, and drive efficiency through innovation while maintaining rigorous safety standards. The undergraduate curriculum includes mathematics, physics, chemistry, mechanics, biology, and management, much of which is common with other engineering departments. However, chemical engineering research is more related to chemistry. Here, we show that chemical engineers cite journals in WoS’ chemical engineering category most, followed by physical chemistry, energy & fuels, multi-disciplinary chemistry, environmental science, and multi-disciplinary materials science. According to a bibliometric analysis, the major research poles include materials, biotechnology, catalysis, environment, and thermodynamics. The 5 top cited journals in 2012 were Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., J. Membrane Sci., Chem. Eng. Sci., J. Hazard. Mater., and J. Catal., which are not the journals with the highest impact factors of the category. Can. J. Chem. Eng. was ranked third among the 32 classical chemical engineering journals after AIChE J. and Chem. Eng.

The microfoundations of firms’ explorative innovation capabilities within the triple helix framework,"In this paper we show how the triple helix model provides an organising regime within which participant firms can extend their capabilities for explorative innovation through funded collaborations with academia. In so doing, we adopt Felin et al.’s multi-level framework to examine the microfoundations of participant firms’ capabilities for explorative innovation in university partnerships. In our qualitative case study of a set of research projects that comprise a national research programme, we decomposed the microfoundations of the processes, interactions and the structures that facilitated the extension of member firms’ explorative innovation capabilities nurtured within each university-industry partnership. We explain the attitudinal and behavioural modifications of the firms’ individuals involved in the research project collaborations with university partners that aggregated into firm-level capabilities. Ultimately, we show that using a microfoundational lens allows for a deeper understanding of how triple helix programmes can influence the capabilities of firms for explorative innovation.",Ryan P.; Geoghegan W.; Hilliard R.,Journal,Technovation,2018-08-01,J.E.

A total life cycle cost model (TLCCM) for the circular economy and its application to post-recovery resource allocation,"The consumerism-driven, consumption-based linear economy is leaving a trail of economic, environmental, and societal challenges in its wake. The Circular Economy, a new economic framework, can be combined with the 6R-based elements of sustainable manufacturing in order to relieve these challenges by establishing a closed-loop material flow. To realize this ideal state, a total life cycle cost model (TLCCM) is needed to serve as the primary engineering economic model. Therefore, a framework for such a model is presented that aims to aid stakeholders in making decisions regarding all aspects of the product life cycle. It is intended that these stakeholders use this model in order to challenge the status quo of costly “green”-centric decisions and demand innovation in the overall process in order to realize a net positive total life cycle cost benefit alongside a balanced Triple-Bottom-Line (TBL). To illustrate how the TLCCM can be applied, an application is explored that uses the model to determine post-recovery resource allocation into three closed-loop streams (Recycling, Remanufacturing, and Reusing). An outlook for future research is then presented.",Bradley R.; Jawahir I.; Badurdeen F.; Rouch K.,Journal,"Resources, Conservation and Recycling",2018-08-01,University of Kentucky,Circular economy ;  Closed-loop ;  Life cycle costing ;  Recycling ;  Sustainability ;  Sustainable manufacturing
An organizational capital decision model for knowledge-intensive organizations,"Using several factors essential to determine the income of a knowledge organization, we formulate a mathematical programming problem for allocating the firm's capital budget between organizational and physical capitals. We solve this problem to obtain an analytically tractable and easy to implement decision rule to enhance the firm's expected income and, subsequently, value. The model applies interconnections of these capitals and their constituent variables in the context of the firm's valuation through the growth of its operating income. Finally, we illustrate our findings by studying the capital allocations of IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, Symantec, EMC Corporation, Hewlett-Packard, and CA Technologies, which constitute eight of the ten of the world's largest software companies. We use the data from their financial statements covering the period 1991-2015, and find that the companies that had a stable policy setting higher priority on their budget for organizational capital enjoyed superior financial performance over the 25 years of our study. Professionals in the field of engineering and technology management can benefit greatly from the findings of this study as they can use it to justify the firm's capital investment budget for organizational capital, because it typically includes items of greater interest to them such as the intangibles, intellectual property, and human capital. The paper gives directions for future research in the relatively new area of organizational capital.",Juneja J.; Amar A.,Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2018-08-01,San Diego State University;Seton Hall University,Capital allocation ;  capital decision ;  knowledge-intensive organization ;  organizational capital ;  software industry

The Fourth Industrial Revolution and implications for innovative cluster policies,"The Fourth Industrial Revolution has become a global buzz word since the World Economic Forum (WEF) adopted it as an annual issue in 2016. It is represented by hyper automation and hyper connectivity based on artificial intelligence (AI), big data, robotics, and Internet of things (IoT). AI, big data, and robotics can contribute to developing hyper automation that can increase productivity and intensify industrial production. Particularly, robots using AI can make decision by themselves as human being on complicated processes. Along with the hyper automation, the hyper connectivity increases not only at national, but also global level by using information and communication technologies (ICT). IoT is the core technology to create the hyper connectivity in Cyber Physical System (CPS) that connects technology, nature, and human being. Accordingly, a perfect convergence between ICT and manufacturing can be completed in the Fourth Industrial Revolution era and an extremely efficient flexible production system by spreading IoT in CPS will be established. Under such a condition, innovative clusters must play their traditional roles in cradles of technology innovation and commercialization. It must be difficult challenges for innovative clusters to meet their targets and to be adjusted by the changing new environment at the same time. This paper argues how the Fourth Industrial Revolution can change the global production chain and how core technologies function in industries. Furthermore, it focuses on how innovative clusters have to evolve to respond the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Last, but not least it also analyzes whether or not innovative clusters can play their roles as technology innovation hubs in the real world and CPS in the Fourth Industrial Revolution era.",Park S.,Journal,AI and Society,2018-08-01,Tech University of Korea,CPS ;  Fourth Industrial Revolution ;  Hyper automation ;  Hyper connectivity ;  Innovative cluster policies

GPS Integrated inertial navigation system using interactive multiple model extended kalman filtering,This paper presents an implementation of a Global Positioning System (GPS) integrated inertial navigation system (INS) for vehicle state estimation. The INS uses Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF) of the linearized state space model for state estimation. The two INS EKF models have differently tuned noise parameters. The models operate in parallel using an interactive multiple model (IMM) approach. The IMM mixes the state and state covariance estimates from both models to yield a combined estimate of the system states. The mixing weights are based on the likelihood of each model correctly tracking the system states. The likelihoods are computed using the innovation and innovation covariance matrices of each model. The model with the higher likelihood has a larger influence on the overall state estimation. The KITTI Vision Benchmark dataset has been utilized for testing and validation. The GPS coordinates have been transformed into a local tangent frame position estimation. Orientation measurements are provided by the dataset for heading correction. The analysis shows that the INS system accurately tracks the position and orientation; the IMM filter generally outperforms the single EFK model estimator during turning maneuvers where the IMM filter produces a lower mean position error than a single EKF filter.,Glavine P.; De Silva O.; Mann G.; Gosine R.,Conference Proceeding,MERCon 2018 - 4th International Multidisciplinary Moratuwa Engineering Research Conference,2018-07-27,Memorial University of Newfoundland,extended kalman filter ;  global positioning system ;  inertial navigation system ;  interactive multiple model filter
Biomaterials for tissue regeneration: From basic research innovation to clinical application,"Biomaterials are the focus of material science and life science, as tissue repair and regenerative medicine research have been regarded as the resolution of the increasing need in national health care. Biomaterials have been developed into bio- degradable and bioactive third-generation materials after the first generation of inert materials and the second generation of active or degradable materials. In recent years, with biomaterials been developing into artificial extracellular matrix, the usage of biomaterials to build cell tissue microenvironment plays an important regulatory role in promoting cell adhesion, morphology, proliferation and differentiation, and tissue structure and function of repair and reconstruction of organs. At present, with the advance of surface modification and genetic engineering technology at home and abroad, synthesis of fusion protein biomaterials with compound functions, cell specificity of polysaccharide and dynamic way of the combination of intelligent hydrogels, such as bionic cells and bionic extracellular microenvironment, provide a new design method and technology. In addition, through three-dimensional (3D) structure which could simulate cell microenvironment in order to promote cell growth, it can not only provide enough space for cells, but also favor the growth of cell adhesion, matrix deposition, oxygen and nutrients, and conducive to blood vessels and nerves. Because of the complexity of the human body, using cultured cells and bioactive materials to replace or regenerate tissues and organs involves interactions between cells and materials. Besides, partial repair and regeneration of single tissue components have been achieved in numerous organs. However, complex tissue structures need synchronous repair and regeneration which just as the situation happens in lower animal those have full potential to regeneration limb or large part of their body. The realization of synchronous repair and regeneration requires the suitable injury and repair surrounding environment to initiate the repair and regeneration process. It also needs the right cellular candidates with tightly regulation to drive and lead the whole process of repair and regeneration. In addition, the timing of repair and regeneration also should be precisely control, such as how long the repair needs and when the regeneration process stops. In summary, to achieve perfect repair and regeneration needs the right cell types to drive the process in suitable environment at the right moment. With the material implanted in body, it would involve in immune system, development, blood supply, innervation, function adjustment, and aging, which need the corporation of multidisciplinary researchers in cell biology, developmental biology, molecular biology, biology, materials science, and clinical medicine.

Recovery and reuse of structural products from end-of-life buildings,"Buildings and construction have been identified as having the greatest potential for circular economy value creation. One source of value creation is to recover and reuse building products from end-of-service-life buildings, rather than destructive demolition and downcycling. While there is a trade in non-structural and heritage product recovery and reuse, the largest volume, mass and value of most buildings comprise structural elements-concrete, brick and masonry, and steel-which present many challenges. A comprehensive literature review confirms limited attention to innovation and advanced techniques to address these challenges and therefore the potential reuse of the stocks of accumulated building products globally and associated environmental benefits. Potential techniques being tested in an Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council circular economy research programme are referenced as a key building block towards circular economy building system redesign.",Hopkinson P.; Chen H.; Zhou K.; Wang Y.; Lam D.,Journal,Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers: Engineering Sustainability,2018-07-23,University of Exeter Business School;University of Bradford;The University of Manchester,
Research Framework and Anticipated Results of Cyberspace Digital Virtual Asset Protection,"Digital virtual assets have become an important social wealth. However, the research on digital virtual asset protection is still at the exploratory stage at home and abroad, and the systematic basic theory research needs to be solved, especially the systematic research on basic mathematical model, security management and transaction, security threat management mechanism and so on. All these have become the trend and hotspot in the field of cyberspace digital virtual asset protection. In order to effectively deal with the severe challenge of digital virtual assets protection, the basic theory system of digital virtual assets protection, which includes the crypto-currency, digital copyright, network games and other network space digital virtual assets, is studied. The mathematical models of virtual assets, security management, threat perception and risk control are used to establish the basic theory and method for the protection of cyberspace digital virtual assets. Three key scientific problems of digital virtual assets protection, such as the mathematical representation of digital virtual assets, the safety and controllability of the application about digital virtual assets, and the research on the threat management and control of digital virtual assets are considered, and 1 basic mathematical model, 3 key technologies, and 1 set of prototype systems are proposed, which can be briefly described as the 1-3-1 plan. Through the research of digital virtual asset basic mathematical model, digital virtual asset security management and transaction technology, digital virtual asset security threat perception method and digital virtual asset dynamic risk control mechanism, the basic theory and method of digital virtual asset protection are given. Finally, a digital virtual asset security management and transaction prototype system is built to verify the correctness and reliability of the research results. The following five aspects of innovation are realized, which are the mathematical model of digital virtual assets based on algebraic theory, statistical analysis, non-distinguishable confusion, information hiding, all homomorphism encryption, lattice theory signature; the digital virtual asset safety management and transaction method based on new block chain, workload proof and swarm intelligence; the adaptive discovery method for security threats of digital virtual assets based on Immune Theory; the real-time quantitative calculation method of digital virtual assets security threat based on human body temperature risk warning mechanism; the dynamic risk control method for digital virtual assets based on the threat of network environment. Based on the above content, a theoretical research system of cyberspace digital virtual assets protection is constructed to solve the technical problems of the mathematical characterization of digital virtual assets, the safety and control ability of the application of digital virtual assets, and the threat management and control of digital virtual assets. This study is of great theoretical significance and wide application prospects for the protection of digital virtual assets in cyberspace, and the results have great significance to protect the national cyberspace security, to develop independent intellectual property rights and self-control rights of cyberspace digital virtual asset protection technology, and to break the technical blockade and monopoly against our country.",Li T.; Yang J.,Journal,Gongcheng Kexue Yu Jishu/Advanced Engineering Sciences,2018-07-20,Sichuan University,Cryptocurrency ;  Cyberspace security ;  Digital copyright ;  Digital virtual assets ;  Electronic money ;  Virtual asset protection
The National Science Foundation: FY2018 appropriations and funding history,"The National Science Foundation (NSF) supports basic research and education in the non-medical sciences and engineering. NSF is a major source of federal support for U.S. university research, especially in certain fields such as computer science. It is also responsible for significant shares of the federal science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education program portfolio and federal STEM student aid and support. Overall, the Trump Administration is seeking $6.653 billion for NSF in FY2018, an $819 million decrease (-11%) from the FY2017 enacted level of $7.472 billion. NSF has six appropriations accounts: Research and Related Activities (RRA), Education and Human Resources (EHR), Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC), Agency Operations and Award Management (AOAM), National Science Board (NSB), and Office of Inspector General (OIG). The FY2018 request would decrease total budget authority primarily in three accounts relative to FY2017 enacted funding: RRA by $672 million (-11%), EHR by $119 million (-14%), and MREFC by $26 million (-12%). The request would provide slight decreases to AOAM ($1.5 million decrease, -0.5%) and OIG ($200,000 decrease, -1.3%), and no change for NSB. As reported by the House Committee on Appropriations, H.R. 3267 would provide a total of $7.340 billion to NSF for FY2018. This amount is $133 million below (-1.8%) the FY2017 enacted funding level and $687 million (10.3%) above President Trump's FY2018 request. The bill would keep funding for the RRA, EHR, NSB, and OIG accounts the same as the FY2017 enacted amounts and decrease the MREFC and AOAM accounts by $131 million (-62.8%) and $1.5 million (-0.5%), respectively. The text of H.R. 3267 was incorporated into the omnibus appropriations bill, the Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act, 2018 (H.R. 3354, Division C), and passed, as amended, by the House on September 14, 2017. H.R. 3354 would provide the same total funding amounts for NSF accounts as provided in H.R. 3267. As reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations, S. 1662 would provide a total of $7.311 billion to NSF for FY2018. This amount is $161 million below (-2.2%) the FY2017 enacted funding level, and $658 million above (9.9%) President Trump's FY2018 funding request. Compared to the FY2017 enacted level, this bill would keep funding for the NSB and OIG accounts the same and decrease funding for four accounts: RRA by $116 million (-1.9%), MREFC by $26.2 million (- 12.5%), EHR by $17.6 million (-2%), and AOAM by $1.5 million (- 0.5%). The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-56, Division D), signed by the President on September 8, 2017, provided funding for NSF through December 8, 2017, at the FY2017 level, subject to a 0.6791% across-the-board decrease. The Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-90, Division A) amends P.L. 115-56 to extend funding through December 22, 2017. Overall growth in the NSF budget has slowed since FY2003. Average annual growth in NSF appropriations was 8% between FY1997 and FY2003, 4% from FY2004 to FY2010, and 1% between FY2011 and FY2017. Among NSF's appropriations accounts, RRA has accounted for the lion's share of growth in obligations since FY2003. Agency appropriations levels were last authorized in FY2010 and expired in FY2013. Various reauthorization measures were introduced in the 114th Congress that included proposed funding levels; none were enacted. In the 115th Congress, the American Innovation Act (H.R. 1569 and S. 641), introduced as companion bills in March 2017, would authorize increasing appropriations for NSF through FY2021 and adjust the discretionary spending limits to accommodate those increases.",Harris L.,Book,"Science Policies and Programs: History, Funding and Issues",2018-07-18,,

Visualizing the intellectual structure and evolution of innovation systems research: A bibliometric analysis,"Commercial business simulation games (BSGs) have been well developed since 1956, and thus they have been extensively adopted and researched. Faria et al. (2009) published an insightful 40-year review of BSGs. However, the articles of the analysis was only from Simulation and Gaming Journal for answering why BSG was adopted and how it was used. This research used the Web of Science academic online research database and CiteSpace software for additional bibliometrics analyses to demonstrate visually intellectual structures and developments. The present study uses citation analysis to detect and visualize disciplinary distributions, keyword co-word networks and references co-citation networks, as well as highly cited references to demonstrate the use of a science mapping approach to perform the review. Such that the researchers may apply the procedure to the review of a scientific domain of their own interest. And secondly, to identify major areas of research activities concerning science mapping, intellectual milestones in the development of key specialties, evolutionary stages of major specialties involved, and the dynamics of transitions from one specialty to another in business simulation games research from 2002 to 2018.",Chao C.; Tsai T.; Chen M.; Wu W.; Hsu C.,Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2018-07-16,National University of Kaohsiung,Bibliometrics ;  Business Simulation Games ;  CiteSpace ;  Intellectual development ;  Scientific visualization

Review on the Development of Nanodiamonds Used as Functional Materials,"Natural diamonds are too rare and precious to satisfy the growing industrial demand. Annual output of artificial diamonds made by industrial synthesis technology has exceeded remarkably that of natural diamonds. Now, because of their extreme hardness, diamonds are mainly used as abrasive materials and super-hard materials in industry, mostly for grinding tools, blades and for drilling, cutting, polishing, etc. In addition to the high hardness, diamonds also display other excellent properties, such as optical properties, electrical properties, catalytic properties, lubrication properties, biocompatibility, etc., and thus are especially suitable for functional materials. Synthetic diamonds have been successfully prepared through three different strategies: Ⅰ. Ultrahigh-pressure and high-temperature process, i. e. the so-called static catalyst approach, which results in single crystal diamonds; Ⅱ. Chemical vapor deposition efficient for producing bulk (or sheet) diamond with large size; Ⅲ. The detonation method that can synthesize ultrafine (usually nanosized) diamond powders. Large single crystal, large-size bulk (sheet) and nanosized powders are currently the most promising, exemplary and state-of-the-art forms for functionalized artificial diamonds. However, the research and innovation for the functionalization of diamond and its composites are inadequate, especially for nanodiamond that shows a variety of excellent properties, such as high modulus, high hardness, high thermal conductivity, good insulation, unique photoelectric characteristics, low friction coefficient and excellent wear resistance, satisfactory chemical stability and biocompatibility. The original application of nanodiamonds and their composites is to serve as photoelectric materials, and have now been extended to the fields of biological medicine, drug delivery, catalysis, thermal management, lubrication, etc., indicating a rapid, hopeful and high-potential development prospect. Nanosized diamonds generally tend to agglomerate, which is similar to other nanomaterials. This can be solved or alleviated by stirring-assisted ball milling, ultrasonic treatment, electrospinning, and so on. Moreover, for certain application purpose, chemical modification is also indispensable. For the sake of grafting ideal chemical functional groups onto the surface of nanodiamond, changing, adjusting and designing the chemical activity of their surfaces, and in consequence, further mitigating agglomeration and improving solubility and dispersibility in solvents (or solid matrices), researchers have tentatively adopted various chemical modification approaches including carboxylation, hydrogenation, ammoniation, amidation, acylation and hydroxylation. And the modified nanodiamonds have successfully and swiftly found biomedical application, e. g. biological imaging, molecular imprinting, bio-sensing, cell-targeted drug delivery, tissue engineering and so on. The surface functionalization of the nanodiamonds facilitates the combination of them with polymer matrices by forming covalent bonds, which can promote dispersion and thermal conductivity of the nanodiamond-reinforced composites. Furthermore, functionalized nanodiamonds have also been applied in the fields of photocatalytic mate-rials, friction materials, photoelectric materials, self-cleaning materials, etc. In this paper, the recent advances of nanodiamonds serving as functional materials is summarized. The modification methods, agglomeration and dispersion of nanodiamonds are introduced, focusing on the above-mentioned application situation. It is expected to provide a reference for the further research.",Zhang W.; Wang Y.; Liang B.; Li Q.; Luo W.; Sun C.; Cheng X.; Sun Y.,Journal,Cailiao Daobao/Materials Review,2018-07-10,Zhongyuan University of Technology;Sichuan Vocational College of Chemical Technology,Anodiamond ;  Diamond ;  Functional material ;  Nanocomposite ;  Superhard material

Key Factors in Building a Corporate Accelerator Capability: Developing an effective corporate accelerator requires close attention to the relationships between startups and the sponsoring company.,"Overview: Since the creation of the first innovation accelerator, Y Combinator, in 2005, corporate accelerators are increasingly being adopted as a way for established firms to source innovation from startups. However, few studies have addressed the drivers of successful accelerators. This case study examines the experience of an established, global firm that launched 12 corporate accelerators between 2013 and 2016. The findings highlight two critical factors in building an effective corporate acceleration capacity: 1) designing a differentiated value proposition for startups based on the capitalization of corporate assets, and 2) developing a specific process to manage the relationships between the corporation and the startups involved in the accelerator. One strong mechanism increasing the potential for success is the assignment of dedicated business developers who can act as boundary spanners and oversee relationships to ensure that the interests of both parties converge.",Mahmoud-Jouini S.; Duvert C.; Esquirol M.,Journal,Research Technology Management,2018-07-04,École des hautes études commerciales de Paris,Accelerators ;  Corporate venturing ;  Open innovation

Efficiency of government-sponsored R & D projects: A metafrontier DEA approach,"Government R & D investments are steadily increasing with the perception that R & D plays an important role in technological innovation and sustainable economic growth. In particular, because biotechnology is recognized as one of the next growth engines, the Korean government has recently increased their investment in biotechnology R & D. However, careful analysis of the efficiency of government-sponsored R & D projects is still lacking. In this paper, we measured the technical efficiency and technology gap ratio to investigate the efficiency of Korean government-sponsored R & D projects of 16 sub-biotechnologies from 2007 to 2013 using a metafrontier Data Envelopment Analysis approach. There was no improvement in overall efficiency between 2007 and 2013. Biochip development technology has been the most efficient sub-biotechnology field and the least efficient fields have been biotechnology product safety and efficacy assessment technology. Medical science and engineering is the closest to optimal production technology among sub-biotechnologies. The efficiency of universities and government-funded research institutes is high, while the efficiency of companies is relatively low. The results suggest that the government should improve the R & D planning process and establish a customized R & D investment strategy that considers the characteristics of technologies and the seven organization types of R & D conductors to increase R & D efficiency.",Park J.; Shin K.,Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2018-07-04,"Seoul National University;Chungbuk National University, College of Medicine",Data envelopment analysis ;  Metafrontier approach ;  R & D project efficiency ;  Technical efficiency ;  Technology gap ratio
"Assistive technology products: a position paper from the first global research, innovation, and education on assistive technology (GREAT) summit","This paper is based on work from the Global Research, Innovation, and Education on Assistive Technology (GREAT) Summit that was coordinated by WHO’s Global Cooperation on Assistive Technology (GATE). The purpose of this paper is to describe the needs and opportunities embedded in the assistive product lifecycle as well as issues relating to the various stages of assistive product mobilization worldwide. The paper discusses assistive technology product terminology and the dangers of focusing on products outside the context and rolling out products without a plan. Additionally, the paper reviews concepts and issues around technology transfer, particularly in relation to meeting global needs and among countries with limited resources. Several opportunities are highlighted including technology advancement and the world nearing a state of readiness through a developing capacity of nations across the world to successfully adopt and support the assistive technology products and applications. The paper is optimistic about the future of assistive technology products reaching the people that can use it the most and the excitement across large and small nations in increasing their own capacities for implementing assistive technology. This is expressed as hope in future students as they innovate and in modern engineering that will enable assistive technology to pervade all corners of current and potential marketplaces. Importantly, the paper poses numerous topics where discussions are just superficially opened. The hope is that a set of sequels will follow to continue this critical dialog.Implications for Rehabilitation Successful assistive technology product interventions are complex and include much more than the simple selection of the right product. Assistive technology product use is highly context sensitive in terms of an individual user’s environment.

Early Prediction of Project Duration: A Longitudinal Study,"Using earned value management (EVM) protocols, numerous innovative models for the critical task of predicting project duration have been proposed in recent years. Due to the nature of EVM, these models, however, appear to be useful only after the project’s construction phase begins. The objective of this study is to examine the longitudinal relationships between completed project time and project variables’ performance prior to the construction phase and to model those useful relationships to predict completed project duration. The research results confirm the significance of scope, team, communication, risk, and innovation performance prior to the construction phase and reveal reasonable estimation accuracy and a relatively small difference in prediction rates between in-sample (88.13%) and out-of-sample (85.49%) data.",Chen H.,Journal,EMJ - Engineering Management Journal,2018-07-03,National University of Tainan Taiwan,Performance Measurement ;  Program and Project Management ;  Project Duration Prediction ;  Project Management ;  Project Time Performance ;  Schedule
Personal and Contextual Antecedents of Knowledge Sharing and Innovative Performance among Engineers,"This research investigates the impacts of proactiveness, openness to experience, and extraversion on innovative performance among engineers. The work also examines the mediating role of knowledge sharing. Using a person–situation interaction perspective, the study further explores the moderating role of perceived organizational support (POS) in personality–knowledge sharing relationships. Data collected from engineers (N = 183) across various public and private engineering firms in Pakistan reveal that knowledge sharing mediated the relationship of proactiveness and extraversion with innovative performance. In addition, highly proactive and extraverted engineers are more likely to share knowledge when the POS is high. Contrary to the expectations, engineers who highly exhibit openness to experience are less likely to share knowledge under high POS. These findings provide significant contributions to the theory and practice of engineering management by highlighting the essential link of personality traits with knowledge sharing and innovation among engineers.",Abbas M.; Sajid S.; Mumtaz S.,Journal,EMJ - Engineering Management Journal,2018-07-03,Riphah International University;National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences Islamabad,Innovative Performance ;  Knowledge Management ;  Knowledge Sharing ;  Perceived Organizational Support ;  Personality
Optimisation of engineering system using a novel search algorithm: the Spacing Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm,"A large number of real-world issues are among difficult and multi-objective problems. Recently, it has been recognised that the evolutionary algorithms optimise well these types of problems. This paper proposes a novel multi-objective search algorithm that is called the Spacing Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (Spacing-MOGA). The innovation of the proposed Spacing-MOGA lies in a new survival selection algorithm called Spacing Distance. This research eliminates some of the disadvantages of other algorithms such as the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGAII). The proposed Spacing-MOGA is applied to five test benchmark functions and also to the design of I-Beam. Then, the results are compared with other algorithms such as NSGAII, Adaptive Weighted Particle Swarm Optimisation (AWPSO), and Non-dominated Sorting Particle Swarm Optimiser (NSPSO) based on the test metrics: Hypervolume, Spacing, Spread, and Generational Distance. Furthermore, for further demonstration of the ability of the proposed Spacing-MOGA, the experimental results are evaluated by the t-test.",Falahiazar L.; Shah-Hosseini H.,Journal,Connection Science,2018-07-03,"Islamic Azad University, Science and Research Branch",Adaptive Weighted Particle Swarm Optimisation ;  I-Beam ;  Multi-objective problems ;  Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II ;  Non-dominated Sorting Particle Swarm Optimiser

Research on the construction of SPOC teaching model based on ARCS and practice in open education,"As an inheritance and innovation of MOOC(Massive Open Online Course), SPOC which is short for Small Private Online Course is characterized by small and private. It can provide new opportunities for the reform and development of online education. However, due to the weak control of SPOC teaching learning environment and lack of self-regulation ability of learners, at present the learners' weak learning motivation and lack of self-confidence have become the main contradiction in deep learning of SPOC. Therefore, this study proposed the use of ARCS theory (which is short for Attention, Relevance, Confidence and Satisfaction, proposed by J.M.Keller in 1987) to guide the research and practice of SPOC. Based on the analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of typical SPOC teaching cases at home and abroad, it drawed on ARCS theory applied to related research in online education, and constructed a new SPOC instructional model based on ARCS theory. Then, this model was applied to D open university, and the participants in the experiment were assessed, including satisfaction and acceptance. At last, We concluded that this teaching model not only improved the teaching effect of SPOC, but also could effectively arouse and maintain the learning motivation, and enhance the self-confidence and participation of learners. It was practical for the reform and development of open education.",Jiang Y.; Cui C.; Nie Y.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2018 7th International Conference of Educational Innovation through Technology, EITT 2018",2018-07-02,Shaanxi Normal University;Shenyang No. 2 Middle School,ARCS ;  Online Education ;  Open Education ;  SPOC ;  Teaching Model

Enhancing High-School Students' Computational Thinking with Educational Robotics Learning,"In recent years, engineering education has become one of the challenging issues in Thailand education. By teaching and learning subjects independently, students are limited to subject-oriented problems, which are not in reality. To address these flaws, integrating knowledge across disciplines becomes significantly necessary. In the past years, STEM has been accepted as one of the effective strategies to bridge the difference in nature of each field to construct more practical projects and innovations. Moreover, the educational robot can be employed as a learning tool in that strategy since it not only provides challenging learning missions but also promotes computational thinking for the students. Therefore, this research study proposed STEM learning activities on three-day workshop to lay out the foundation to the high-school science-and-technology students who are becoming the engineering students. The workshop comprises of eight phases to facilitate their learning inquiry process with hands-on experience; moreover, the activities were designed in consideration of promoting computational thinking with challenging learning missions. The findings of this study showed that the proposed workshop activities are beneficial for the students who outperformed on robotics with higher computational thinking; meanwhile, they could provide more relevant responses regarding the proposed learning activities.",Chookaew S.; Howimanporn S.; Pratumsuwan P.; Hutamarn S.; Sootkaneung W.; Wongwatkit C.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2018 7th International Congress on Advanced Applied Informatics, IIAI-AAI 2018",2018-07-02,Rajamangala University of Technology Phra Nakhon;King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok;Mae Fah Luang University,Computational thinking ;  Educational robot ;  Engineering education ;  STEM

Scalable Agile Transformation Process (SATP) to Convert Waterfall Project Management Office into Agile Project Management Office,"Recently, the Project Management Office (PMO) has become the source of change and spirit of innovation within any organization. It determines the success of project management functions and achieves the organization's objectives. However, most banking organizations have a group of waterfall projects within a startup PMO; it is not established to use agile practices and methodologies. Therefore, transforming the waterfall project management office (WPMO) into agile PMO (APMO) is a challenging topic, especially when the organizational structure is not built as strongly projectized structure.

Using Research projects in the classroom to improve Engineering education,"Engineering schools and colleges have the challenge of training engineers for the future, who, in addition to excel in the discipline's own technical skills, must be innovative and capable of working in a globalized and changing economy. The scenarios that are glimpsed, require the engineer to have specific competences that must be developed in their training process.Proposals such as the 2020 engineer suggest, among other things, that engineering education must be transformed to help achieve the vision and to develop innovations in, hitherto, unknown fields for engineers. Higher education challenge in engineering is to train students to become modern and effective engineers capable of participating and leading conception, design, implementation and operation of systems, products and projects. For this, the students must not only be prepared technically, but also be socially responsible and have the capacity to be innovating permanently. Modern engineering projects require a combination of several disciplines, so engineering schools must incorporate them into existing programs and through activities outside the classroom.Additionally, research as the basis of teaching and training allows the teacher to leave aside the role of passive mediator between theory and practice. One of the methodologies for carrying this out is the classroom research project with students. This didactic strategy aims at producing changes in the professor's paradigms, passing from passive methodologies to active and constructivist pedagogical practices in the classroom.This paper presents the experiences of the professors of the College of Engineering and Basic Sciences of Politécnico Grancolombiano using research projects in the classroom. They show that altering classroom situations encourage meaningful learning for students, supports quality education and foster on the professors the development of, among others, pedagogical, technological and communicative, competences.Some research projects done by students in their in the classroom are: Crutches designed with a weight dampening system in the technical design area; Technical requirements for the design of a food packaging in the industrial engineering program; Electronic Menu (Each table has a tablet that shows the different liquors offered, the customer has the possibility to select the desired one, as well as to make mixtures, at the end the client sends the order, which is received by the person in charge to then be delivered to the client) in the systems engineering program; The manufacture of: Artificial snow, beer, aromatic candles, glue made from gasoline and polystyrene and copper sulfate crystals in the chemistry area; Work in conjunction with the subjects of simulation and stochastic programming to develop a holistic view on the processes in the industrial engineering program, among others.This paper describes the approach, development and results of research projects used by professors in industrial engineering, systems engineering and systems management technology programs. It shows that the integration of curricular strategies, educational, methodological and evaluation, allow to transform not only classroom practices and academic programs, but also the processes of curricular, teaching and research management. In this way, the professional development of teachers, pedagogic management and the research capacity of the Faculty is strengthened.",Pizarro N.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2018-07-02,Institution Universitaria Politecnico Grancolombiano,Classroom research project ;  Engineering Education ;  Engineering schools ;  Methodologies ;  Pedagogical practices
Co-creative engineering curriculum design - Case East Africa,"This work-in-progress study reports the first findings from an engineering curriculum design process in an East African context. The design of new programs and teaching practices involves three universities with local faculty designing a new engineering curriculum with external experts involved in the design process. Innovation is something that in addition to societies and industries also the global academia is striving towards, and not only in research but more and more so also in education [1]. The big question, however, is how to achieve this and how to make innovation happen inside the classroom when the faculty needs to push the boundaries of science while at the same time being transformative educators [2]. And all this in a global higher education environment, where well-established institutions are in the cross pressure of neoliberal worldview and the humboldtian ideal of the community of scholars [neoliberal]. On the other end innovation and creativity are argued to be products of co-creation and a non-controlled if not chaotic and emergent environment. Much different from tradition and critical thinking (devils advocate) driven scientific world or establishment that sees cultural change and societal pressure often as a threat to their independence. The empirical part for this study involved several co-creation workshops where students and faculty participated and where co-creative learning methods where tested in a local environment. Although the processes ran parallel and where not coupled together both workshops gave insight on the preconditions of curriculum design and design of learning methods in the context in question. The Northern European university in question was responsible for organizing the workshops in collaboration with East African partners. The results show that there are several constraints for curriculum design and the adoption of new learning methods. The first results using the co-creation model proved, however, useful. The process of curriculum design and implementation will go on for the next two years until year 2020.",Taajamaa V.; Jarvi A.; Laato S.; Holvitie J.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2018-07-02,Turun yliopisto,Activating teaching methods ;  Curriculum design ;  East Africa

Exploring Pedagogical Risk-Taking of Engineering Faculty,"This Research Work in Progress Paper presents a pilot study focused on understanding how faculty take pedagogical risks in 2nd and 3rd year (mezzanine level) engineering courses. Broadly, we are interested in understanding ways of making widespread changes in the mezzanine level of the curriculum. The purpose of this exploratory research is to develop an understanding of faculty pedagogical risk-taking through observations, interviews, and artifact analysis. The primary data for this project are observations of four mezzanine level engineering courses. During the observation we took detailed field notes and collected course handouts, lesson plans, or other course materials. After the lesson was completed, we conducted a post-observation teacher interview to learn about the broader context of that lesson within the class, how the lesson has evolved over time, and plans for that lesson in future courses. This work in progress serves as a pilot study to better understand how to capture pedagogical risk-taking in the classroom. Analysis of observations, field notes, and course material is being utilized to develop data collection techniques and investigation protocols for the future exploration of pedagogical risk-taking.",Sheppard M.; Kellam N.; Carberry A.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2018-07-02,Arizona State University,Innovation ;  Pedagogical risk-taking ;  Pedagogy

The main approaches to build 3E are inheritance and innovation, integration and emergence, coordination and sharing, which means to transform subject-oriented to industrial demand-oriented, transform subject independent to subject integrated, transform the role of adapting the requirements of application to the role of leading to the development of industry. This paper mainly focused on the innovation of 3E and discussed some methods of how to cultivate compound, creative and applied engineering talents.",Li Y.; Jiong Z.; Qi T.; Yu S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2018-07-02,School of Engineering and Applied Science;Beihang University,Application Centered ;  Emerging Engineering Education ;  Engineering Talent ;  Industry-University Cooperation
"A Mixed Methods Approach to Understanding How Colleges, Universities, and Employers Prepare and Support Undergraduates in Engineering Internships","This Research to Practice Work In Progress Paper describes an academic-industry research partnership aimed at understanding how undergraduate juniors and seniors navigate a summer internship at a large global engineering company in the automotive industry. The study explores the question: What are the relationships between internship experiences and engineering students' self-efficacy, creativity and innovation, and future academic and career choices and plans? Focusing on survey and interview data collected from product development interns at a single engineering firm, this research explores the highlights and challenges encountered in their internship as well as their perceptions regarding opportunities for creativity and innovation. An additional set of interview questions examined the organizational ecology within the company based on who interns interacted with and sought out for mentorship and support. These results are contextualized in findings from a survey of undergraduate engineering students across a nationally representative sample of 27 U.S. engineering schools. Future research based on survey and interview data will take a mixed methods approach to inform an actionable understanding of the role of engineering internships for three critical stakeholders across whom an engaging effective pathway is sought: students, colleges universities, and industry.",Chen H.; Powers K.; Prasad K.; Anderson M.; Royalty A.; Gilmartin S.; Sheppard S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2018-07-02,Ford Motor Company;Stanford University,Academic-industry research partnerships ;  Career plans ;  Innovation ;  Internships ;  Self-efficacy
Multi-dimension training scheme to improve the innovation capacity of postgraduate and undergraduate students collaboratively,"This Innovative Practice Work in Progress Paper presents a multi-dimension training scheme to improve the innovation capacity of postgraduate and undergraduate students collaboratively. The current training of postgraduate and undergraduate education schemes cannot form a mutually beneficial relation, not suitable for the training of innovation capacity on postgraduate and undergraduate students collaboratively. There are various problems that need to be addressed. The main strategy of the proposed scheme is utilizing real research programs to establish an integrated team mixed with both postgraduate and undergraduate students, focusing on stimulating their innovation capacity in scientific research. In the scheme, we designed a multi-level joint training mechanism based on the mixed pedagogy, the collaborative resource pool platform, the multi-role and team-based innovation talent incubation mechanism, and the preparatory postgraduate student selection and training goal achievement evaluation mechanism. We applied the scheme to the training process of postgraduate students from the majors of Software Engineering, Computer Software and Theory, Computer Application, Computer Technology and Electronic Information Engineering, and undergraduate students from the majors of Computer Science and Technology, Information Security and Communication Engineering in Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications. The training results approve the feasibility and effectiveness of the scheme.",Xu X.; Shen J.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2018-07-02,School of Communications and Information Engineering;Nanjing University of Post and TeleCommunications,Collaborative training ;  Innovation ;  Postgraduate education ;  Undergraduate education
'Our Little World': (Un)envisioning the Social and Ethical Implications of Engineering,"This Research Full Paper explores how undergraduate students understood the social relevance of their engineering course content knowledge and drew (or failed to draw) larger social and ethical implications from that knowledge. Based on a qualitative case study conducted in a junior level engineering class, we found that the majority of students had difficulty perceiving the social and ethical aspects of engineering as important or appropriate topics in an engineering course. Many students only considered the immediate technical usability of or improved efficiency from technical innovations as the primary social and ethical implications of engineering. This study investigates a potentially critical flaw in the structure of engineering programs, highlighting the limitations that accompany a discipline-specific academic focus. Highly structured programs leave little room for engineering students to interact with other students/programs on campus, and limit opportunities to engage in meaningful interdisciplinary discourses and expand their perspective.",Lim J.; Findlater N.; Interiano C.; Tkacik P.; Dalhberg J.; Faw L.; Hunt B.; Nguyen N.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2018-07-02,William States Lee College of Engineering;The University of North Carolina at Charlotte,Cultural analysis ;  Engineering ethics ;  Qualitative case study ;  Undergraduate engineering students
Students' perceptions of best and worst aspects of design courses: A qualitative analysis of 87 courses and 5591 students,"This Full Paper presents the results of qualitative analysis of students' perceptions of the best and worst aspects of 87 courses related to design such as engineering design, product design, biomedical engineering innovation and design, and Mechanics-Based Design. The total enrollment in the courses was 5591 students at a Research-Intensive University in the US. Iterative close readings of the comments and open and axial coding were applied to the comments to generate codes that represent students' comments. Codes were grouped in categories that represent students' opinions about teaching. Students reported the best and worst aspects of design courses related to the following categories: course planning and logistics, teaching strategies, learning experiences, assessment and evaluation, mentoring and modeling, and encouragement and motivation. This work suggests that careful design of all aspects of teaching is important. Special attention should be given to aspects of design courses such as project-based learning, teamwork, and hands-on applied learning.",Ibrahim A.; Reese M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2018-07-02,Johns Hopkins University,Design courses ;  Qualitative metbods ;  Student evaluation of teaching ;  Student rating of instruction
Effectively transforming students through first year engineering student experiences,"The premise of this Research to Practice Work in Progress Paper is that promoting STEM student attraction, transfer, retention, and academic success is critical for the future workforce and the economy of our Nation especially for the underrepresented populations in the STEM workforce. At many higher education institutions, including minority serving institutions, there is a need to address primary skill deficiencies in engineering students. These deficiencies in skills can be technical and non-technical (i.e., personal, soft). Most of the current efforts from faculty and existing educational programs, focus on developing technical skills, where the faculty makes an extraordinary effort to help students learn and understand the courses' contents. For this reason, the focus of this paper is on non-technical skills for student academic success. The objectives of this paper are (1) identify the potential skills necessary to thrive in an engineering program; this includes a literature review on skills, (2) define educational experiences as interventions to develop these skills in the students, and (3); explore the metrics associated with the selected skills; this is necessary to measure improvements. These skills will enable the self-transformation of students to be more effective and successful. It is expected that a critical mass of these students will promote and nourish communities of learners. These successful students will continue their transformation into professional innovators to tackle critical needs in their respective regions. Educational experiences on innovation will help in the development of specific skills to initiate a transformation in the student that can allow them to thrive in an engineering program. This transformation of self, community (as a student), and region (as a professional) can become a model that can be transferred to other institutions interested in preparing resilient learners.",Hernandez N.; Fuentes A.; Crown S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2018-07-02,The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley,Self-entrepreneurship ;  Self-innovation ;  Skills

Special Session: Developing an Effective Propagation Plan for Educational Innovations,"The special session offers resources for developing effective propagation plans for educational innovations and opportunities to apply these resources. Organizations supporting development of innovations in engineering education are placing more emphasis now than previously on plans for propagating the innovation beyond the original developers. The goal of the special session is to help participants prepare effective propagation plans for proposals for innovative approaches for engineering education. The special session is organized using a framework that was generated from an evaluation of funded educational innovation development projects, a study of well-propagated innovations in undergraduate STEM education and review of the relevant literature on organizational change and diffusion of innovations.",Froyd J.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2018-07-02,College of Engineering,Adoption ;  Dissemination ;  Propagation ;  Research to practice
Trade-offs in curriculum design: Implementation of an integrated curriculum in chemical engineering,"This Innovative Practice Full Paper reports on perceptions of a curriculum reform innovation in an undergraduate engineering program in chemical engineering at a South African university. A key feature of this program is an integrated curriculum design, which involves a coherent development of theoretical topics alongside closely related project work. This design was chosen in alignment with the core objectives which were to improve the quality of student learning in the program and to increase the relevance of the curriculum to contemporary developments in the profession. The study took place during the year in which the final year of the new curriculum for the four-year program was implemented. Both lecturers and teaching assistants involved in delivering the new curriculum, and final year students who had been the first cohort through the curriculum were surveyed in an open-ended questionnaire. The study goes beyond a traditional evaluation design to be able to research in-depth differing perceptions of the new curriculum. The discussion focuses on the implicit trade-offs when moving to a more integrated curriculum design. The analysis also focuses on the inherent immediate challenges of implementing a substantial change to curriculum, and how this is perceived by both academics and students.",Case J.; Heydenrych H.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2018-07-02,University of Cape Town,Curriculum reform ;  Student experiences ;  Student learning ;  Student success
Engineering Emotion : SStudents tell Stories about the Costs of Being Innovative,"When prompted to imagine the story of today's top engineering graduate, one might imagine a successful leader and innovator in this 'research to practice' full paper. Changes in the emotional responses of today's college students pose an intriguing question: can generational differences in emotion suggest a shift in entrepreneurial mind-set and leadership choices post-engineering education? This paper uses modified original protocol developed by Horner (1972) on gendered generalizations of professional success and Engle's (2003) updated approach for considering responses about occupational choice. The researchers also included an emotion scale (PANAS, 1988, 2007) to conduct an examination of 83 college students' responses to a 'storytelling cue' prompt about a time when a new engineering graduate stepped away from their CEO role within their founded company. Measures in two parts are reported. Stories written by the participants are coded for the presence or absence of specific motives, e.g. achievement, power, innovation. Factors of mood are coded as negative affect and positive affect. This study had two between-subject's factors (gender of participant - female, male - and gender of engineer in the cue prompt - female, male) which yielded four conditions: females-female prompt, males-male prompt, females-male prompt, and males-female prompt. Six univariate ANOVAS, each two by two, crossed two independent variables (gender of the participant and cue prompt gender) to produce four experimental conditions. Results revealed negative affect vs. positive affect responses to the cue. The females in the story received more negative responses by men, and the men coded more negative overall. Data from the preliminary experiment offers stunning stories by college students with compelling motivational and emotional characterizations. Some implications of gender on the costs of being innovative in engineering are discussed.",Karanian B.; Parlier A.; Taajamaa V.; Monaghan G.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2018-07-02,Stanford Engineering;Wentworth Institute of Technology;Turun yliopisto,Emotion ;  Entrepreneurial intent ;  Gender ;  Innovation ;  Leader ;  Motivational characteristics ;  Projective prompts
Sustainable educational innovation through engaged pedagogy and organizational change,"This Research-to-Practice Work-in-Progress Paper presents a midway report on a change initiative underway in the College of Computing and Informatics (CCI) at UNC Charlotte. Comprised of approximately 100 faculty members and nearing 2,000 undergraduate majors, CCI was awarded a 5-year, $2 million grant from the National Science Foundation in 2015 to revolutionize computer science education at the collegiate level. This initiative, which seeks to simultaneously achieve both pedagogical and organizational change, is built upon a foundation of educational innovation through engaged teaching practices. To sustain educational innovation in CCI beyond the funded scope of the project, pedagogical change is thus strategically embedded in CCI's organizational structure through a 3-stage model of faculty adoption, redesigned student course evaluations, and realigned values in the reappointment, promotion, and tenure process. By recognizing that sustained organizational change takes root when there is concurrent buy-in from organizational members - both bottom-up and top-down - this reform initiative seeks to embed two-pronged change not only via educational innovation (pedagogical change), but also in the day-to-day practices, policies, and physical environment of the College itself (organizational change).",Frevert T.; Rorrer A.; Davis D.; Latulipe C.; Maher M.; Cukic B.; Mays L.; Rogelberg S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2018-07-02,College of Computing and Informatics;The University of North Carolina at Charlotte,Computer science education ;  Engaged teaching practices ;  Organizational change ;  Pedagogical change
Promoting Innovation and Entrepreneurship as part of an Engineering Curriculum,"This Research to Practice, Work in Progress, paper explores the relationship between entrepreneurship, innovation, and systems thinking, through examining the published work in these areas, and how innovation can be incorporated as part of an engineering curriculum.

Design of a technology-enhanced pedagogical framework for a systems and networking administration course incorporating a virtual laboratory,"Practical hands on lab activities are crucial to learning in fields such as computing, engineering and science. Advances in technologies have allowed the design and development of virtual and remote laboratories with many benefits overcoming constraints of physical laboratories. In literature, we observe a number of virtual labs implemented for systems-level courses in computing, using virtualization and cloud computing technologies. Although benefits of such technology-enhanced labs are well-known, the best approach to integrate these labs to achieve best outcomes for learning is still an exploratory area of research. In this paper, existing literature on virtual labs implementation for systems-level courses in computing is analyzed and classified into two stages of evolution. In the first stage, technical design evaluation is the focus while in the second stage, pedagogy and learning theories and principles are used as the basis in designing technology innovations as well as teaching learning activities. The second stage has the advantage of theoretical principles guiding the design of teaching and learning activities and technology artifacts with a focus to achieve learning outcomes and thus a higher potential to achieve learning goals. However, we observe only a few studies taking this approach. This paper presents the design of a holistic technology-enhanced pedagogical framework incorporating a virtual laboratory for a systems and network administration course. The framework applies theories such as Constructive Alignment for curriculum design and Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle, Bloom's Taxonomy and Collaborative Learning to design teaching learning activities and assessments. Technology artifacts such as virtual labs, a feedback tool, student and teacher dashboards, on-line quizzes and discussion boards are incorporated. Our future work will evaluate the framework in real class environments.",Athauda R.; Alkhaldi T.; Pranata I.; Conway D.; Frank C.; Thorne W.; Dean R.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2018-07-02,"The University of Newcastle, Australia",Learning Theories ;  Systems-level courses ;  Technology-enhanced Pedagogical Framework ;  Virtual Labs
Highlighting the Future of Autonomous Vehicle Technology in 2020-2050,"As the world enters the age of the 4th industrial revolution, the future of work has re-emerged as a fundamental question, among policy-makers, business leaders, workers and the broader public around the globe. This is applied by accelerating innovations and adoption of ever more sophisticated automation technologies. Most of the existing research and reports have focused on the impact of automation in advanced industrial countries. In this paper, we explore the role of software engineering in autonomous transportation in 2050, its challenges and research trends. The exploration will be done through analysis of different reports and UAE government summit prediction. We intended to see the vision of the future of software engineering that prepares engineers for future emerging technology. This could contribute to the solution and design of international standards as well as increase the market confidence. In addition, this can also contribute towards a proper start-up of self-driving technology. We believe that a successful adoption of Autonomous Vehicles (AV) in developing a future automobile system will best be attained through an effective risk management strategy. As a result, the potential threat to the AV will further be investigated by industry and government entities to deal with the huge threats of cybersecurity that might face the autonomous vehicles.",Barghuthi N.; Pavithran D.; Said H.,Conference Proceeding,ITT 2018 - Information Technology Trends: Emerging Technologies for Artificial Intelligence,2018-07-02,HCT-Sharjah Campus;Zayed University;Abudhabi Polytechnic,autonomous transportation ;  autonomous vehicles ;  compliance ;  driverless ;  software engineering
Mathematics micro flipped and micro collaborative learning with sophomore Aerospace Engineering students,"The implementation of flipped teaching in higher education is increasing, often with the aim to offer flexibility in terms of time and place to a diverse student population. However, the full implementation of the flipped teaching methodology requires great effort and preparation, and even under these conditions, a time of adaptation and testing is also necessary. In order to prepare an adaptation to flipped teaching methodology, a micro flip teaching module for Mathematics lab sessions has been designed and implemented in Aerospace Engineering. This model has been reinforced by micro collaborative learning, in which flipped teaching and cooperation among students, two aspects whose positive impact on learning has been tested, are integrated to boost the learning process.This research focuses on the measurement of the impact of the proposed micro flipped teaching and collaborative learning methodology in order to determine the degree to which students are involved in the process and benefit academically. Results obtained throughout the course show that the adaptation is fast and easy and the student perception of the usefulness of the model is based more on the methodology itself than on either course content or the teachers participating in the experience.",Sanchez Ruiz L.; Moll S.; Rosello M.; Llobregat-Gomez N.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 World Engineering Education Forum - Global Engineering Deans Council, WEEF-GEDC 2018",2018-07-02,Universitat Politècnica de València,educational innovation ;  micro collaborative learning ;  micro flipped teaching
Project hindsight reconsidered: : Reflecting on how engineers can study the sources of innovation,"Engineers seek to improve how their work benefits society, but often lack clear frameworks on how to study the sources of innovation for engineering breakthroughs. Case studies are one way to assess how basic and applied research becomes used in some engineering developments. To provide a reference point for how engineers could study the sources of innovation, the paper will discuss the largest scale study to date of how science becomes used in engineering: The controversial 1963-1969 Project Hindsight study from the US Department of Defense. Hindsight studied 20 weapons systems developments that occurred from 1947-1962 by having teams of researchers do case studies on the developments' history. The paper analyzes claims from the Hindsight report that showed few basic science research events leading to practical engineering developments, as well as subsequent criticisms. Reflecting on the Hindsight methodology and doing new case studies on engineering today could help engineers direct their work to a greater societal benefit.",Pirtle Z.,Conference Proceeding,"International Symposium on Technology and Society, Proceedings",2018-07-02,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,engineering ;  innovation ;  policy ;  Project Hindsight ;  research evaluation
A new transdisciplinary approach to foster soft skills in engineering : Using critical reading micro-workshops,"International reports presented in recent years insist on the need to develop soft skills to a greater degree considering the future jobs required to address the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The biggest problem arises with two of those competences in particular: Critical Thinking and Creativity, given the difficulty of their enhancement using the logical-scientific approach traditionally used in engineering programs. That implies the need to consider disruptive innovations in teaching-learning approaches. In this study, research was conducted to verify the relationship between a mixed infusion-immersion implementation of an artistic-narrative approach and the development of these two soft skills. The results showed that, using the same stimulus path that metacognitive tools of the artistic process provoke, is a very efficient way to naturally develop soft skills in Generation Z students. Critical Reading MicroWorkshops were implemented into classroom activities involving a Critical Reading framework. The results obtained corroborate the significant influence that the new approach had to foster Critical Thinking and Creativity in engineering students.",Caratozzolo P.; Alvarez A.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 World Engineering Education Forum - Global Engineering Deans Council, WEEF-GEDC 2018",2018-07-02,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Creativity ;  Critical Thinking ;  Educational Innovation ;  Soft Skills in Engineering
Controlling concurrent change: Managing in-field change in critical embedded systems,"Recent trends in the automotive domain show a fast development towards automated driving functions with growing complexity that comes along with increasing computing power of automotive platforms. Due to the long lifetime of automobiles compared to the innovation cycles of functionalities, in future, new functionality will have to be added by software updates. However, performing such updates on a safety-critical system requires a methodologically safe approach. In this paper, we outline how this is tackled by the DFG research unit ""Controlling Concurrent Change"" that formalizes the integration part of a V-model like development process aiming at in-field integration.",Möstl M.; Schlatow J.; Peeck J.; Ernst R.; Nolte M.; Jatzkowski I.; Maurer M.; Jankowski A.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 12th European Workshop on Microelectronics Education, EWME 2018",2018-07-02,Technische Universität Braunschweig,
Enhancing gender balance in engineering education and practice,"Despite the rapid development brought about by the exponential expansion of engineering in technological scope and societal impact that are quite noticeable, the level of representation of women in this unique profession is still very low. Research has shown that few women study engineering at the tertiary institution or university-level with less than 25% of total enrollment, pursuing an engineering career after graduation. Thus, the underutilised pool of talent that women represent may actually limit access to a larger pool of future engineers, entrepreneurs, innovators, etc., and hence a limiting access to a more diverse talent pool. This situation has resulted in impaired creativity and innovation, which is the essence of engineering. This paper therefore reviews the issue of gender balance in engineering education and practice, with the main objective of highlighting the likely causes of the disparity and how it can be alleviated, in order to facilitate and enhance gender balance in engineering education, practice and the profession at large. Closing the gender gap in engineering enrollment and practice will require a lot of re-appraisal of existing strategies on the part of stakeholders. Delimiting policies, primordial cultures, curricula, etc., may have to be changed and career paths made more welcoming in order to enhance women enrollment and participation in engineering.",Imasogie B.; Oyatogun G.; Taiwo K.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 World Engineering Education Forum - Global Engineering Deans Council, WEEF-GEDC 2018",2018-07-02,Obafemi Awolowo University,Engineering ;  Enrollment ;  Gender ;  Job ;  Participation
What computer scientists can learn from social scientists : on the significance of an interdisciplinary research agenda for shaping digitalization and its social implications,"This contribution aims to illustrate the importance of interdisciplinary exchanges between computer scientists and social scientists in order to navigate and regulate processes of digitalization. An awareness of the differences between those two scientific cultures is a necessary precondition for unambiguous and successful communication. We hold the view that such a perspective is indispensable for cushioning the various effects on the social level that are connected with the constantly increasing relevance of digitalization in everyday life. To make our insights clearer, we focus on challenges engineers encounter when developing algorithms in the field of security technologies. On the whole, the paper intends to reveal the occasional perfidious complexities in innovation processes and votes for a strong support and assistance of software engineers through social scientists with regard to questions of technology assessment and responsibility, especially in the context of such a strongly politicized field as digitalized security.",Bartl G.; Gerhold L.; Dorner K.,Conference Proceeding,"International Symposium on Technology and Society, Proceedings",2018-07-02,Deutsches Institut für Urbanistik gGmbH;Freie Universität Berlin,algorithmic governance ;  digitalization of security ;  ethics ;  future of technology ;  interdisciplinary research approaches ;  research agenda ;  science and technology studies ;  security technologies ;  social implications of technology ;  social sciences ;  software engineering

Cognitive Secure Shield - A Machine Learning Enabled Threat Shield for Resource Constrained IoT Devices,"The Internet of things (IoT) devices come in various operating form factors. Some are operated on unconstrained resources by directly connecting to the electrical grid with Cloud Compute driven memory and processing capacities; others, operated on constrained resources by connecting to finite battery sources and limited memory and compute. Whatever the form factors are, importantly, the expectations from consumers are the IoT devices must be secured - both in terms of data and in terms of safety and efficiency. For securing IoT devices with unconstrained resources, there are many tools and compute technologies are available. On the other hand, Securing IoT devices with constrained resources, the options are few and pose huge challenges in terms of price, performance, and service costs. In this research paper, we propose machine learning enabled cognitive secure shield that secures the Dairy IoT devices operating under constrained resources. Our innovation is in the design of Secure shield framework that enhances security posture of our Dairy IoT device without affecting Useful Life of the device (ULD).

Temporal Impact Analysis for Technological Innovation Based on Box-Cox Transformation,"In addition to the preferential attachment mechanism, the evolving citation history of a technical paper is also influenced by time. However, the influence pattern varies a lot in real cases, and cannot be described by a certain distribution like normal distribution. In order to find a universal model to measure the influence of time, this paper proposed a model which combines the normal distribution with Box-Cox transformation. Compared with existing models such as Logistic model, Gompertz model and Wang's model (Science, 2013), our model explain the actual scientific research rules more widely and obtain higher accuracy by conducting experiments in four cases. It can not only describe emerging research topics but also explain the 'Sleeping Beauties' phenomenon.",Xu J.; Li M.; Li M.; Zhao Q.; Ge B.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2018 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, SMC 2018",2018-07-02,National University of Defense Technology China,Box-Cox Transformation ;  Technological Innovation ;  Technology Assessment ;  Temporal Impact
The Beneficial Effects of an Autonomously Operated Engineering Education Outreach Program: A Case Study of the Servant Leadership Program,"In 2014, the Innovation Center for Engineering Education (ICEE) at a large university in South Korea benchmarked the Servant Leadership Program (SLP), an engineering education outreach program of a nearby university. SLP operated continuously while recently undergoing a critical change in the operating agency, from the ICEE to a student body participating in the program. The purpose of this case study documents the transformation of the SLP during its organizational change under a qualitative research framework. The results indicated this change caused the SLP to evolve serendipitously in three aspects: (1) improved program quality, (2) enhanced student leadership and professional skills and (3) extended scope and boundary of the program to broader communities. These improvements exceeded expectations from when the organizational transformation was planned and launched. The autonomously operated the SLP resulted in significantly more benefits to the community and participating students than under the previous management scheme. We hope that this autonomous approach can be disseminated to more universities, as an exemplary program for maximizing benefits to both the community and participating students.",Jung E.; Song K.; Jang D.; Kim J.; Yoo I.; Son B.; Choi J.; Hwang S.; Lee S.; Chong Y.; Cho E.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of 2018 IEEE International Conference on Teaching, Assessment, and Learning for Engineering, TALE 2018",2018-07-02,Hongik University;Korea University,case study ;  community service ;  engineering education ;  leadership development ;  outreach
Creating value in e-learning: Beyond triple-factor to improve teaching-learning experience,"E-learning has emerged as an innovative paradigm of modern-day education, with the dramatic improvement of information and communication technology (ICT). This growth in ICT has used to deliver three main activities in education namely teaching, learning, and assessment/evaluation using various methods in e-learning, which generally involves complicated processes. However, all these processes in teaching-learning activities has to design to achieve one goal, which is achieving learning outcomes in order to be effective, hence create value to learners. Value creation is producing a product or a service that meets customer demands, which involves innovation and new product or service development that intends to create prominence to customers and ultimately stakeholders. These value propositions delivered through internal operations, have been researched in limited number of researches in elearning in Sri Lanka. This research proposes and statistically validates a model for e-learning value creation covering technological, operational, and process perspectives, which discusses beyond triple-factor in e-learning value based on learning style, motivation, and knowledge and ability. Mix research method was employed for data collection and analysis in this research to ensure achievement of research objectives. The results demonstrates that strengthening three perspectives in e-learning, technological development, operational, and people to create value in e-learning. Technology infrastructure can build up investing on technology, human, organizational, and information aspects relate to technology; e-learning operational perspective focuses on input and output mix, teaching-learning activities, and networking with direct and indirect externalities to create value. Teachers, learners, and institution have to solidify by matching teacher-learner profiles by means of ICT and establishing people with administration, management, and resources. The research concludes the interconnectivity of these three perspectives in creating and delivering value in teaching-leaning process.",Malawige I.,Conference Proceeding,"18th International Conference on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions, ICTer 2018 - Proceedings",2018-07-02,University of Moratuwa,E-learning ;  Teaching-learning ;  Technological-operational-people ;  Value creation

The Mediating Effect of Knowledge Internalization on the Relationship between Dual Learning Behaviors and Technological Innovation Performance in the Hightech Enterprises,"High-tech companies promote the internalization of knowledge by inducing advanced technology from the outside and independent research. This is a tool, used by enterprises, to promote technological innovation and development as well as new product research to enhance their innovation performance. Empirical evidence from the large and medium-sized high-tech enterprises in China shows that both the exploration and the exploitation of learning activities positively affect the enterprise's technological innovation. The exploitation fits to Chinese large and medium-sized high-tech firms even better. Checking for the knowledge internalization, we found that it had a partial mediating role in the relationship between the firm's learning behaviors and technological innovation performance, hence, it is believed to improve the performance of the company's technological innovation. The results can be used as useful reference by the firms to carry out learning activities and enhance knowledge internalization in order to promote their technological innovation performance. The paper contributes to the literature on learning behavior, knowledge management and technological innovation performance and has implications for further study and research.",Wangdu F.; Yang N.; Sharif S.,Conference Proceeding,IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management,2018-07-02,Northwestern Polytechnical University,Exploitation Learning ;  Exploration Learning ;  Knowledge Internalization ;  Technological Innovation Performance
Lessons in Biochar: Advancing Research Through Service Learning Courses in Nepal,"Biochar, created by burning organic waste in an oxygen-deprived environment, has a number of potential uses including improving soil fertility in agricultural applications, substituting for firewood as a household energy supply and acting as water filtering medium as well as its potential for carbon sequestration. Students from Arizona State University (ASU), University of New South Wales (UNSW) and Nepal's Tribbhuvan University (TU) have participated in three service learning courses in the small community of Amaltari, Nepal, to investigate the sustainable supply of biomass as well as analyzing the costs and benefits of biochar production in the community. Located in the south-central Nepal, Amaltari is one of the buffer zone communities across the Chitwan National Park and the research is focused on assessing the feasibility of using invasive plant species-Mikania micrantha and Lantana camara as the biochar feedstock. The distinguishing feature of our research is its focus on science-based and community-led innovation to co-generate solutions through integrating students and faculty from engineering and sustainability with the local biochar company and the buffer zone community of Amaltari. The case study will show that on-The-ground experiential and multiple stakeholder engagement processes involving disciplines ranging from sustainability to engineering to cultural anthropology have the potential to address 'wicked' environmental problems.

"'Strategy Making', Not Re-engineering: Thinking Ahead, Again, and Across for Process Innovation in Home Care","As a result of information asymmetry and uncertainty, home care (HC) is unamenable to conventional re-engineering. Paradoxically, patients can experience long access to care, while service providers experience low productivity. Our action research sought to adapt Neo and Chen's (2007) conceptual framework of thinking ahead, again, and across to process innovation in HC. The framework is derived from public sector innovation in Singapore, pursued amid 'black box' uncertainty. Overall, we obtained proof-of-concept by achieving desired outcomes: Patients' access to care shortened from a 7 to 90 day-range to a 1 to 3-day range, while the service provider's productivity was raised from 38% to 65%. In turn, our data and reflections suggest a fairly systematic approach to adapting thinking ahead, again, and across to process innovation in HC, with a real-world case, tables, and figures for reference. We propose a strategy making analogy as a guide for broad analyses-syntheses, surfacing options, and adapting workflow activities as the basic unit of analysis. Action research, with support from change management interventions, is likely to yield more effective process innovation in HC.",Wong D.; Hiew Y.,Conference Proceeding,IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management,2018-07-02,Hull University Business School;Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy,Home care ;  Industrial engineering ;  Long term care ;  Process innovation ;  Strategy
Appropriate Technology and Management for Sustainability,"Innovation in technology in the last few decades has revolutionized society's ability to solve problems.

A Conceptual Interaction Cycle between Individual and Group Absorptive Capacity with Social Integration Mechanism and Cohesive Learning Group as Moderating Variables,"Many researchers agree that absorptive capacity (ACAP) is a critical multilevel construct (individual to organization) for innovation success. Interestingly, little attention has been paid to this construct independently or the interaction among the levels in a full cycle. This conceptual paper aimed to visualize a proposed research model to fill in the theoretical and empirical gap in the multilevel interaction by detailing some promising moderators from the ACAP conceptual model, that is, cohesive learning groups and social integration mechanisms adopted from organizational learning (OL) 4I theory. In addition, this paper identified feed forward and feedback mechanisms, creating a cycle in the interaction process that had been identified but never tested.

Enhancing cybersecurity skills by creating serious games,"Adversary thinking is an essential skill for cybersecurity experts, enabling them to understand cyber attacks and set up effective defenses. While this skill is commonly exercised by Capture the Flag games and hands-on activities, we complement these approaches with a key innovation: undergraduate students learn methods of network attack and defense by creating educational games in a cyber range. In this paper, we present the design of two courses, instruction and assessment techniques, as well as our observations over the last three semesters. The students report they had a unique opportunity to deeply understand the topic and practice their soft skills, as they presented their results at a faculty open day event. Their peers, who played the created games, rated the quality and educational value of the games overwhelmingly positively. Moreover, the open day raised awareness about cybersecurity and research and development in this field at our faculty.

A two-staged capstone project to foster university-business dialogue,"Capstone projects improve the endowments of knowledge, ability and skills earned by higher-education students, and help intensify the university-business dialogue. While not solely suited for BSc curricula, capstones raise the employability of BSc graduates, whose market value is intrinsically inferior to their MSc correspondents, yet highly attractive thanks to shorter turn-around time. Designing a BSc curriculum in Computer Science after those premises requires balancing two forces. One is traditional content-centered teaching, which has many adepts and exerts higher pressure on the shorter duration of the study path. The other is learner-centered teaching, which promotes active teaching strategies, and makes room for capstone inserts. This paper discusses how the University of Padua went around that challenge designing its BSc curriculum in Computer Science in 2002, and critically assesses its outcome to date. 27 credit hours of the total 180 in the novel curriculum were devolved to a capstone project comprising an internship in business, whose critical review feeds the final exam. The capstone was organized as a two-staged progression: (a) the first leg being a preparatory, learning-for-work collaborative laboratory aimed at the acquisition of soft skills, and exposure to technology innovation challenges; and (b) the second leg promoting a learning-through-work individual internship. Evaluation of field data from 14 cohorts of graduates, from 07/2004 to 12/2017, shows that the BSc curriculum has met with the appreciation of students and employers, and it has served well the purpose of boosting the university-business dialogue.",Vardanega T.; Fedeli M.,Conference Proceeding,"Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, ITiCSE",2018-07-02,Università degli Studi di Padova,Capstone project ;  Cooperative learning ;  Curriculum development ;  Higher education ;  University/business dialogue
Cybersecurity in liberal arts general education curriculum,"Cybersecurity learning has been explored through different analytical lenses, across a range of grade levels and academic institutions. From attempts to standardize learning with accreditation to refining curricula and labs, there is currently considerable effort to create more programs in this discipline to address a million-job gap within the cybersecurity workforce. One primary challenge in cybersecurity education on the post-secondary level is offering experiential coursework to undergraduate students at liberal arts institutions. While such experiential coursework is already prevalent at research universities, smaller liberal arts institutions are still trying to gain a foothold into offering cybersecurity as a course of study. We address this issue with the design of an undergraduate course and cybersecurity learning modules that fit into the liberal arts education. First, we present the design of a general education course situated in a new educational paradigm, project CyberPaths, aiming at helping primarily undergraduate institutions with limited resources to introduce experiential cybersecurity learning. It takes advantage of experiential learning through a cloud infrastructure called Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI). Then we describe our experience teaching this First Year Experience (FYE) course that exposed freshmen of different majors to cybersecurity. We present the design of pre- and post-course surveys, as well as focus group interviews that were used to evaluate students’ learning experience. Student feedback and direct observation suggest that incorporating flexible cybersecurity modules into general education coursework can be an effective vehicle to demonstrate importance and key concepts of cybersecurity to a diverse student population.",Mountrouidou X.; Li X.; Burke Q.,Conference Proceeding,"Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, ITiCSE",2018-07-02,College of Charleston;Johns Hopkins University,Cybersecurity ;  General Education ;  GENI ;  Liberal Arts
Promoting the adoption of educational innovations,"Most projects that create innovations in Computer Science education, whether they be changes to content or pedagogy, focus on first developing materials and then proving effectiveness. For educational innovations to have impact, however, they must be adopted by other instructors. Getting instructors to use new educational strategies is a significant challenge, with most new techniques never obtaining widespread adoption. Researchers who do consider dissemination of their research frequently use techniques such as publications and workshops, which are known to be insufficient. While there is a significant body of research on how to successfully propagate educational innovations, many CS education researchers are unfamiliar with it. Additionally, the majority of this work is from science education rather than CS education, and it is unclear how it will apply to CS.

Technological universities of India to achieve global quality and excellence,"There is a large number of Technological and Technical Universities in India but unfortunately none of their rank in global ranking with the exception of few premier institutes/universities. These universities are functioning under a highly regulated environment which restricts the level of freedom required for responding to the fast changes happening in the industry. The end result is the graduates passing out of these universities are not employable. This scenario must be changed hence authors of this paper have investigated what ails the technical education system in India. Apart from excessive regulations, large number of colleges affiliated to a university, education treated as a business instead of places for academic excellence and research, and lack of innovations on the part of faculty and students, adoption of quality standards in research, teaching, and management is an absolute imperative to improve existing system. Authors have proposed various programs to be designed and implemented to improve quality in engineering education. The regulatory agencies have also proposed few programs but implementation at the university and colleges/institute level remains questionable.These programs must be championed by the top management of these organizations and adequate funding must be allocated else the importance of these programs gets limited to showing documents and saying right things in front of accrediting agencies at the time of assessment.",Ratnalikar N.; Patil S.,Journal,Journal of Engineering Education Transformations,2018-07-01,"Symbiosis Institute of Digital and Telecom Management;College of Engineering, Pune;Nokia Bell Labs;Indus Valley Technologies",Management ;  Quality programs ;  Technical universities ;  Technological universities

"Evaluation of availability of human, scientific, technological and innovative potential in the context of priorities in scientific and technological development of the Russian Federation","Introduction. The implementation of priorities of the scientific and technological development of the Russian Federation involves an assessment of the trends in the development of human, scientific, technological and innovation potential within the framework of these directions. In modern conditions of transformation of science and technology into key factors of Russian development, it is necessary to provide the country's economy with human resources capable of withstanding ""big challenges"", but at this stage there is a shortage of highly qualified specialists in many key industries that can offer a new scientific result, taking into account the prospects for its application. The purpose of the article is to develop an approach to assess the human, scientific, technological and innovative potentials in the context of priorities in the scientific and technological development of the Russian Federation and its validation using the example of three priorities. Materials and Methods. The materials of this study draw on Rosstat and FSMNO ; Rospatent; Web of Science and Scopus. The object of research is to assess human, scientific, technological and innovative potential in the context of priorities in scientific and technological development of the Russian Federation. In the course of the research, a multiplicative model of the impact of the availability of human, scientific, technological and innovative capacity on labour intensity was developed. In the process of research, the following research and analysis methods were used: comparison, induction and deduction method, generalisation method, chain substitution method, logical structure study, system analysis, and special methods of statistical, comparative analysis. In the methodological plan, we used the system and process appro aches in the basis of the study. Results. The study revealed that the labour intensity in 2016 for all three priorities of the scientific and technological revolution of the Russian Federation has increased. Therefore, according to the priorities of the scientific and technological revolution of the Russian Federation, the availability of scientific, technological and innovative potential is not sufficient, which leads to a decrease in the reverse indicator of labour intensity - labour productivity in the markets within the framework of these priorities. Concerning the impact on labour intensity in all three priorities, one observes: the growth of ""collaborations"" in fundamental research, the applied effectiveness of scientific activity, ""collaborations"" of applied research; reduction in citations from scientific articles, low patent activity of engineering and technical workers, technological demand for patents. Therefore, against the background of emerging collaborative activity of actors in the process of research and development and the growth of the applied effectiveness of scientific activity, there is a low level of orientation of scientific and scientific-technical results to c ommercialisation. Discussion and Conclusions. On the basis of the multiplicative model developed by the authors for assessing the impact of the provision of human, scientific, technological and innovative capacities on labor intensity, it was tested on the example of the three priorities of the scientific and technological development of the Russian Federation (a, b, c). It was revealed that the labour intensity in 2016, according to the priorities of the Scientific and Technical Council of the Russian Federation, increased, and the availability of scientific, technological and innovative potential is not sufficient, which leads to a decrease in the inverse measure of labour intensity - labour productivity in high-tech markets within the framework of these priorities. Concerning the impact on labour intensity for all three priorities, it was revealed: the growth of ""collaborations"" of fundamental research, the applied effectiveness of scientific activity, ""collaborations"" of applied research; reduction in citations from scientific articles, low patent activity of engineering and technical workers, technological demand for patents. It was also revealed that against the background of the emerging collaborative activity of actors in the process of research and development and the growth of the applied effectiveness of scientific activity, there is a low level of orientation of scientific and scientific-technical results to commercialisation.",Mintsaev M.; Ilina I.; Parfenova S.; Dolgova V.; Zharova E.; Agamirova E.,Journal,Integration of Education,2018-07-01,"Russian Research Institute of Economics, Politics and Law in Science and Technology (RIEPL);Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation",Innovation potential ;  Labor intensity ;  Patent activity ;  Personnel potential ;  Priorities of scientific and technological development ;  Publication activity ;  Technology

Automated green innovation for computerized numerical-controlled machining design,"With the development of manufacturing technology and strict international environmental regulations, green production has become an imperative research topic in the manufacturing industry. Because cutting is affected by several factors, the development of green processes is vital for automated cutting using machines. These factors are often subjective and are set up merely based on the manual and experience of engineers, reducing tool life and deteriorating tool precision; ultimately, this approach increases production costs and reduces production efficiency. Moreover, the ecological environment can be seriously affected. Furthermore, the parameters must be adjusted according to variations in the processing state, which is a considerable drawback for the automated cutting industry. In this study, we investigated the precision computerized numerical-controlled cutting process as an example. We first assessed the literature and investigated tool wear and cutting noise as quality standards for green computerized numerical-controlled cutting. The cutting depth, cutting speed, feed rate, and the tip of the center were selected as control parameters. The consistency of the results was verified through an expert questionnaire conducted using analytic hierarchy process, and the weighted values of the control parameters were obtained. Simultaneously, seven environmental efficiency elements of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and TRIZ 39 engineering parameters of the CSI project were used to establish the engineering parameters for the green production design. Furthermore, 40 inventive principles from a contradiction matrix were used to design an optimization strategy to develop and verify an innovation strategy of singular quality. Finally, the experimental results revealed that implementing the analytic hierarchy process coupled with the TRIZ innovative thinking mode and green production concept enables enterprises to reduce their consumption of raw materials and waste production during the design process. This approach effectively reduces the burden on the environment and thus facilitates industry competitiveness and sustainability.",Lan T.; Chuang K.; Chen Y.,Journal,Advances in Mechanical Engineering,2018-07-01,Yu Da University;Yuan Ze University,analytic hierarchy process ;  Automation ;  green innovation ;  green production ;  TRIZ
Integrating unbanked rural populations through frugal innovation: A case of Gramateller in India,"Vortex Engineering Private Limited is based at Chennai in Tamil Nadu state in southern part of India. This company came into news with its breakthrough innovation in manufacturing, selling, installing and servicing the world’s lowest power-consuming automated teller machines (ATMs), named, the GramatellerTM targeted at the semi-urban and rural segments of India. With a mission to help banks reach out gainfully to every nook and corner of the country, Vortex, after seven years of diligent research, has designed highly reliable, eco-friendly, easy to use and rugged ATM, which can save power up to 90 per cent and can be operated using solar power. The ATM hitherto was an unviable proposition in rural areas to any bank but GramatellerTM broke the stereotype with its low power-consuming ATM, which not only provided financial access to remote areas but also increased deposits in banks. The case presents a coherent depiction about the business, and growth of Gramateller, an innovation that is unique by virtue of its frugality, disruptivity and game-changing characteristics vis-à-vis its role in integrating isolated geographies. The facts are compiled from published sources.",Raju P.,Journal,South Asian Journal of Business and Management Cases,2018-07-01,"Symbiosis Law School, Hyderabad",Financial inclusion ;  Game-changing technology ;  Gramateller ;  Innovation ;  Societal integration
Deterministic lattice reduction on knapsacks with collision-free properties,"The knapsack problem is an important problem in computer science and had been used to design public key cryptosystems. Low-density subset sum algorithms are powerful tools to reduce the security of trapdoor knapsacks to the shortest vector problem (SVP) over lattices. Several knapsack ciphers Chor-Rivest, Okamoto-Tanaka-Uchiyama, and Kate-Goldberg were proposed to defend low-density attacks by utilising low-weight knapsack problems. Some evidence was also found on the vulnerabilities of the above three knapsack ciphers to lattice attacks. However, previous lattice-based cryptanalytic results have been established via a probabilistic approach. The authors investigate some collision-free properties and derive from the properties a deterministic reduction from the knapsack problems in the Chor-Rivest, Okamoto-Tanaka-Uchiyama, and Kate-Goldberg knapsack ciphers to SVP without imposing any restriction and assumption. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the proposed reduction is the first deterministic reduction from public key cryptographic knapsacks to SVP.",Ping Y.; Wang B.; Tian S.; Yang Y.; Du G.,Journal,IET Information Security,2018-07-01,Civil Aviation University of China;Xidian University;Xuchang University,

Investigating the role of ICT intervention in grassroots innovation using structural equation modelling approach,"Research on information communication technologies (ICT) for entrepreneurship development is burgeoning, yet our understanding of the use of ICT in support of grassroots innovation remains unclear. This paper examines the moderating role of the use of ICT on the relationship between grassroots innovation (GRI) and entrepreneurial success (ES). The study involved 400 grassroots entrepreneurs selected from three states in India, and the moderating effect of the use of ICT was analysed using moderated structural equation modelling. The results revealed that the use of ICT partially moderates the relationship between the new learning practices and economic benefits. It also partially moderates the relationship between local solution and economic benefits, but it fully moderates the relationship between networking capabilities and economic benefits, where the relationship is stronger when the use of ICT is high. Furthermore, the study found that the use of ICT does not moderate the relationship between new learning practice and non-economic benefits, relationship between local solution and non-economic benefits and relationship between networking capabilities and non-economic benefits.",Singh S.; Sindhav B.; Eesley D.; Bhowmick B.,Journal,Sadhana - Academy Proceedings in Engineering Sciences,2018-07-01,University of Nebraska Omaha;Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur,entrepreneurship development ;  grassroots innovation ;  Information communication technologies (ICT) ;  structural equation model
Exploring the impact of innovation implementation on supply chain configuration,"Considering the foreseen digital transformation and rapid dissemination of technological innovations, this paper investigates what happens along the supply chain (SC) when process and product innovation practices are implemented. The research examines the SC strategy and configuration of four product families; it considers the configuration to incorporate the whole range of SC functions and relationships. The paper addresses the little attention paid to the process innovation dimension in SC literature, and develops a framework capturing the dynamics between innovation implementation and configuration decisions and settings.

Domestic energy consumption and climate change mitigation,"In this overview, we use domestic energy use as a lens through which to look at climate change mitigation. First, we provide a brief overview of research on domestic energy use, covering four main disciplines: engineering, economics, psychology, and sociology. We then discuss the results of empirical studies that examine how households may be encouraged to reduce their energy use and help mitigate climate change. We include research findings in three key areas: technological innovations, economic incentives, and informational interventions. We outline the effectiveness of each of these approaches in encouraging domestic energy conservation and provide instances where such approaches have not been effective. Building on this established body of knowledge on direct energy consumption (i.e., electricity, gas, and fuel consumption), we highlight applications for addressing indirect energy consumption (i.e., energy embedded in the products households consume) by discussing its implications for sustainable food consumption as a climate mitigation option. We conclude this overview by outlining how research from the four disciplines might be better integrated in future research to advance domestic energy conservation theory and empirical studies.

Using design strategies from microfluidic device patents to support idea generation,"Microfluidics has been an important method in providing answers to a wide variety of research questions in chemistry, biochemistry, and biology. Microfluidic designers benefit from instructional textbooks describing foundational principles and practices in developing microfluidic devices; however, these texts do not offer guidance about how to generate design concepts for microfluidic devices. Research on design in related fields, such as mechanical engineering, documents the difficulties engineers face when attempting to generate novel ideas. For microfluidic device designers, support during idea generation may lead to greater exploration of potential innovations in design. To investigate successful idea generation in microfluidics, we analyzed successful microfluidic US patents, selecting those with the key word “microfluidic” over a 2-year period. After analyzing the features and functions of 235 patents, we identified 36 distinct design strategies in microfluidic devices. We document each strategy, and demonstrate their usefulness in a concept generation study of practitioners in microfluidic design. While some of the identified design strategies may be familiar to microfluidic designers, exposure to this large set of strategies helped participants generate more diverse, creative, and unique microfluidic design concepts, which are considered best practices in idea generation.",Lee J.; Daly S.; Huang-Saad A.; Seifert C.; Lutz J.,Journal,Microfluidics and Nanofluidics,2018-07-01,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",Creativity ;  Design strategies ;  Idea generation ;  Microfluidics
The Imitator's Dilemma: Why Imitators Should Break Out of Imitation,"Imitation and innovation are two primary R&D approaches that firms follow in technology development, especially in R&D-intensive industries. That imitation and innovation share R&D resources and investments gives rise to what is coined in this article as the imitator's dilemma. The imitator's dilemma tells a story of why firms should break out of imitation-oriented R&D and move toward innovation-oriented R&D in order to sustain their innovation output and profit performance. This article contributes to the technology and innovation management literature by illuminating the imitator's dilemma both theoretically and empirically. To this end, this study develops and tests hypotheses to investigate the influence of a firm's imitation activity on its innovation output and profit performance, which represent a gap in the current literature. A longitudinal research design is followed on an unbalanced panel dataset between 1991 and 2010 from a sample of 227 firms in three R&D-intensive manufacturing industries in the United States, including computer, semiconductor, and pharmaceutical. The results of this research reveal a dilemma for imitators. Imitation activity can generate positive returns in terms of a firm's innovation output and return on assets ROA (a measure of short-term profits). However, these returns are unsustainable. Excessive levels of imitation activity within the firm results in negative returns in terms of its innovation output and ROA. Additionally, any level of imitation activity, low or high, negatively impacts a firm's Tobin's Q (a measure of long-term corporate valuation). Accordingly, this article makes novel contributions to the technology and innovation management literature by explaining the imitator's dilemma and how firms may effectively manage it.",Doha A.; Pagell M.; Swink M.; Johnston D.,Journal,Journal of Product Innovation Management,2018-07-01,Sprott School of Business;Schulich School of Business;Texas Christian University;Institute for Work and Health Toronto,
Does institutional pressure foster corporate green innovation? Evidence from China's top 100 companies,"The value of green innovation on achieving sustainable development is increasingly recognized in recent years. This paper explores whether and how external institutional pressure (including coercive pressure, normative pressure and mimetic pressure, though the last was not discussed in depth) promote green innovation and investigates the moderating effect of internal organizational slack by combining institutional theory and resource-based view. With the sample of China's top 100 listed companies from 2008 to 2014 and generalized estimating equations (GEE) approach, the findings supports the Porter Hypothesis that both coercive pressure and normative pressure have significant positive effects on corporate green innovation. Organizational slack positively moderates the relationship between coercive pressure and green innovation, but has no significant impact on the relationship between normative pressure and green innovation. Accordingly, the scientific value of this research is that it extends the debates on Porter Hypothesis and the role of organizational slacks. The results suggest that the government should strengthen the implementation of coercive tools, the media should play roles of “muckraking”, “catalyst” and the “vanguard” of public inquiry to insert normative pressure, and firms should rationally allocate slacks to improve green innovation.",Chen X.; Yi N.; Zhang L.; Li D.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2018-07-01,Hunan University of Technology and Business;Central South University,coercive pressure ;  green innovation ;  Institutional pressure ;  normative pressure ;  organizational slack ;  Porter hypothesis
Four Food and Drug Administration draft guidance documents and the REGROW Act: A litmus test for future changes in human cell- and tissue-based products regulatory policy in the United States?,"Modern regenerative medicine research has expanded well past the development of traditional drugs and medical devices with many promising new therapies encompassing an increasingly diverse range of substances, notably cell-based therapies. These substantial recent developments and the progress in the health care and therapeutics fields necessitate a new regulatory framework agile enough to accommodate these unique therapies and acknowledge their differences with traditional pharmaceuticals. In the United States, recent proposed changes in the regulatory framework for autologous human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps) and their perceived risk–benefit analysis for patients remain controversial in the scientific field. To provide perspective on of the current status of the most recent attempts to redefine and conceptualize these changes in the United States, we will examine 4 draft guidance documents implemented by the Food and Drug Administration in interpreting relevant concepts and terminology pertaining to HCT/Ps: the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank report, “Advancing Regenerative Cellular Therapy: Medical Innovation for Healthier Americans,” the proposed REGROW Act for HCT/Ps, and the current 24 Food and Drug Administration-approved HCT/Ps and related products in the United States.",Yano K.; Speidel A.; Yamato M.,Journal,Journal of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine,2018-07-01,Tokyo Women's Medical University;Waseda University,"accelerated approval ;  conditional and time-limited authorization ;  conditional market authorization ;  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ;  guidance ;  human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps) ;  market authorization under exceptional circumstance"
Feedback by automatic assessment systems used in mathematics homework in the engineering field,"This research presents the results of the teaching innovation Dynamic Online Assessment System in Mathematics, which is implemented in higher education to promote self-study by students outside the classroom. The WIRIS calculator was integrated into the Moodle platform to create questions with random elements, for example, students had access to different variants of the same question. The effect of the type of feedback (immediate or deferred) on the work of the students on the platform, measured by means of participation, time spent, and grades obtained, was evaluated. We used a quasi-experimental methodology for a population of 5,507 students, distributed in 229 courses on four campuses that learn Mathematics I in engineering programs.

A survey of the advancing use and development of machine learning in smart manufacturing,"Machine learning (ML) (a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on autonomous computer knowledge gain) is actively being used across many domains, such as entertainment, commerce, and increasingly in industrial settings. The wide applicability and low barriers for development of these algorithms are allowing for innovations, once thought unattainable, to be realized in an ever more digital world. As these innovations continue across industries, the manufacturing industry has also begun to gain benefits. With the current push for Smart Manufacturing and Industrie 4.0, ML for manufacturing is experiencing unprecedented levels of interest; but how much is industry actually using these highly-publicized techniques? This paper sorts through a decade of manufacturing publications to quantify the amount of effort being put towards advancing ML in manufacturing. This work identifies both prominent areas of ML use, and popular algorithms. This also allows us to highlight any gaps, or areas where ML could play a vital role. To maximize the search space utilization of this investigation, ML based Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques were employed to rapidly sort through a vast corpus of engineering documents to identify key areas of research and application, as well as uncover documents most pertinent to this survey. The salient outcome of this research is the presentation of current focus areas and gaps in ML applications to the manufacturing industry, with particular emphasis on cross domain knowledge utilization.

History and trends in solar irradiance and PV power forecasting: A preliminary assessment and review using text mining,"Text mining is an emerging topic that advances the review of academic literature. This paper presents a preliminary study on how to review solar irradiance and photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting (both topics combined as “solar forecasting” for short) using text mining, which serves as the first part of a forthcoming series of text mining applications in solar forecasting. This study contains three main contributions: (1) establishing the technological infrastructure (authors, journals & conferences, publications, and organizations) of solar forecasting via the top 1000 papers returned by a Google Scholar search; (2) consolidating the frequently-used abbreviations in solar forecasting by mining the full texts of 249 ScienceDirect publications; and (3) identifying key innovations in recent advances in solar forecasting (e.g., shadow camera, forecast reconciliation). As most of the steps involved in the above analysis are automated via an application programming interface, the presented method can be transferred to other solar engineering topics, or any other scientific domain, by means of changing the search word.

Fortune favors the prepared: How SMEs approach business model innovations in Industry 4.0,"The article analyzes how Industry 4.0 triggers changes in the business models of manufacturing SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises), by conducting a qualitative research with a sample of 68 German SMEs from three industries (automotive suppliers, mechanical and plant engineering, as well as electrical engineering and ICT). As SMEs play an essential role in industrial value creation, the article examines significant, yet at present understudied implications of Industry 4.0 along industrial value chains. First, the results show that Industry 4.0 encompasses three dimensions, namely high-grade digitization of processes, smart manufacturing, and inter-company connectivity. Second, the article shows how Industry 4.0 affects the three business model elements of manufacturing SMEs – value creation, value capture, and value offer – by giving specific examples for business model innovation in each of the three elements. Third, it shows that both the role as a user and/or provider of Industry 4.0 and whether a company is internally motivated and/or externally pressured towards implementation have an impact on which business model elements are innovated. Fourth, the study delineates four SME categories, designed to help managers to evaluate their own company's positioning towards Industry 4.0: craft manufacturers, preliminary stage planners, Industry 4.0 users, and full-scale adopters.

Sustainable Innovation System Using Process of Bagasse Become Sodium Lignosulfonate Surfactant for Enhanced Oil Recovery,"The purpose of this research is to get new product innovation process from bagasse, that is Sodium LignoSulfonate surfactant. Lignosulfonates surfactants in petroleum engineering are used as injection fluids into oil reservoirs to increase oil recovery, which is known as Enhanced Oil Recovery process. Lignosulfonates is made of lignin as raw material, which can be extracted from bagasse as one of its sources. Bagasse contains 24 - 25% lignin, so it is sufficient to be processed into lignosulfonates. Today, bagasse is one of the biomass resources widely used as a boiler fuel in sugar factory, source of animal feed, material for paper, cement and brick reinforcement.This study presents an innovation of bagasse utilization. This innovation involves two scientific application fields, firstly, chemistry in the processing of bagasse into sodium lignosulfonates surfactant and secondly, petroleum engineering in the effort of using sodium lignosulfonates surfactant to increase oil production from the reservoir. The last stage in this process is injection of the sodium lignosulfonates surfactant into a synthetic core in laboratory scale use water and surfactant injection.. The amount of oil that is produced from the injected core shows the increase in oil yield from the sodium lignosulfonates surfactant injection.",Setiati R.; Siregar S.; Marhaendrajana T.; Wahyuningrum D.,Conference Proceeding,E3S Web of Conferences,2018-06-29,Universitas Trisakti;Institut Teknologi Bandung,

Lessons learned from early hypertext research at the University of Maryland,"The Human-Computer Interaction at the University of Maryland saw the development of key technologies leading to today's user interfaces. We will focus on two of them: Hyperties1, 2, 3, 4 was first conceived by Ben Shneiderman in 1982 as a publication tool in which authors produce hypermedia for thousands of readers. It had separate tools for browsing and authoring documents. Each document was called an article and cross-references were implemented as embedded blue text links2 and image maps. Built into Hyperties were author- generated and alphabetical tables of contents including every article plus history lists supporting reversible actions. Hyperties was one of the first software packages that needed no error messages since the design prevented the user from making errors. It was used in the widely circulated ACM-published disk Hypertext on Hypertext"" which contained the full text of the eight papers in the July 1988 Communications of the ACM. The following year Hyperties was used to create the first commercial electronic book, Hypertext Hands-On!3. Hewlett-Packard used Hyperties to distribute electronic documentation for its LaserJet 4 printers in 15 languages. This may have been the first worldwide distribution of hypertext prior to implementation of the World Wide Web. Zooming User Interfaces.

The influence of plume angle and energy on the mass separation of plasma beam,"Plasma optical mass separation is an important innovation in the field of isotopes separation. The magnetic field in the separation region only plays the role of magnetizing plasma and guiding the beam flow direction. The ion trajectory in the separation region containing only radial electric field is the focus of the current research. The plume angle and energy of the plasma beam also determine the effect of beam mass separation. Based on the equation of motion of the ion in the electric field and the mechanism of obtaining the circumferential velocity in the azimuthator, the trajectories of the lithium ions at different plume angles and different energies are analysed, and the parameters of plume angle and energy with the best separation effect are obtained, which provides parameters for the engineering implementation of the multi-mass beam separation structure. The research results can be applied to the development of some devices, such as the mass separator, the mass spectrum analyser and material purification. At the same time, it has certain reference significance for the related field's research of the special configuration electromagnetic field controlling multi-mass beam flow.",Zhao H.; Lin Z.; Wang C.; Liu H.,Conference Proceeding,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,2018-06-27,TaiZhou University;Harbin Institute of Technology;Yanshan University,
Integration of virtual programming lab in a process of teaching programming EduScrum based,"Learning programming languages is essential for computer applications development and naturally for the technology evolution. The conventional teaching model of the subjects of initiation to programming is based on a set of tasks that usually result in a series of difficulties for the students which leads to an exhaustive monitoring by the teachers. It turns out that one of the main problems is that students often do not know if their work is correct (i.e. whether it works for a pre-defined data set) until it is reviewed and evaluated by the teacher. In this context, the Virtual Learning Environment becomes an attractive and interesting tool to help teach (and learn) programming. One of these tools is VPL (Virtual Programming Lab) a plugin of Moodle (Modular Object-oriented Dynamic Learning Environment). We believe that the use of VPL may represent a paradigm shift for students, but also, and especially for teachers, because teachers will have to spend much more time upstream to prepare tasks and activities, test the environment and verify validation of the data. However, it is important to note that downstream teacher effort can significantly reduce because students do not need as much attention given that feedback on the quality and functionality of the code developed is immediate. This work is a part of a PhD in Research at Information Technology in the University of Santiago de Compostela, Spain, and has been developed from the last 12 months. This Ph.D. research aims to analyze the VPL's integration potential in the programming teaching-learning process in higher education. It also aims to verify if, with VPL, it is possible to make student's learning more effective and autonomous, with less time and effort spent by teachers in assignments evaluation. In the present article, we will present a work-in-progress where we will show how VPL was introduced in a teaching-learning process supported on JAVA programming. The teaching method uses EduScrum methodology and is included in the course of Computer Engineering of the Department of Informatics Engineering of the School of Engineering of the Polytechnic Institute of Porto (ISEP / P.PORTO).

Innovation of flipped learning encouraging better communication and critical thinking skills among accounting students,"Currently the trend among the lecturer to adopt innovation and technology as a tool in the lecture hall in fostering and increasing the positive impact among the students. Innovation and technology may encourage better impact to develop soft skills among the students such as communicate effectively, critical thinking skills, demonstrate appropriate interpersonal skills and teamwork, demonstrate leadership qualities and entrepreneurial skill. Many researchers have attempted to study the efficiency of e-learning and blended learning concepts on teaching and learning processes. One of the most recent developments in technology enhanced method in teaching and learning is a method called flipped learning. It is an approach where the traditional one-way lecture is flipped to make room for active learning opportunities where educators shift learning into the individual learning space facilitated by technology. This study implemented flipped learning approach in the effort to enhance communication and critical thinking skills among accounting students in Tunku Puteri Intan Safinaz School of Accounting (TISSA) in Universiti Utara Malaysia, UUM. The objective of this study is to examine how the use of flipped learning can help to improve communication and critical thinking skills in problem solving among students taking the accounting subject. From this study, the results showed that students' communication and critical thinking skill has developed with the use of flipped learning. Sufficient time however, is needed for students to understand the content from the lectures given in the form of a video used as the media in this project used as an e-learning platform in this project, as well as the 'catchy' contents should be created to enhance interest from the students to watch the video.",Ibrahim M.; Khairudin N.; Salleh D.,Conference Proceeding,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,2018-06-27,"College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia",action research ;  Flipped learning ;  technology in education
Tribology of self-lubricating metal matrix composites,"Self-lubricating metal matrix composites (SLMMCs) are a class of materials that have potential to help engineers meet the demands of global initiatives for green manufacturing and sustainability. While SLMMCs have existed for many decades with traditional lubricant materials like graphite and other lamellar solids, such as MoS 2 , WS 2 , h-BN and CaF 2 , BaF 2 , scientists have recently incorporated nanostructured versions of the materials (e.g., carbon nanotubes and graphene). At the same time, new manufacturing and processing techniques have come online, such as additive manufacturing techniques that may provide significant innovation for SLMMCs. In this chapter, the current state of SLMMC research is reviewed, including materials, processing methods, and tribological performance. Processing and property relationships are described, such as influence of testing parameters and content of solid lubricants on friction and wear. Improvements in tribological behavior, as much as possible, are interpreted through third-body approach, which emphasizes materials phenomena at the sliding interface - including mechanical, structural, and chemical changes to the parent materials. Based on the review of SLMMCs and their tribology, recommendations for future research are made that emphasize the use of new materials, new processing routes, and research approaches that seek to reveal more completely the mechanisms by which these materials form tribofilms that are effective at lowering friction and reducing wear.",Zhang Y.; Chromik R.,Book,Self-Lubricating Composites,2018-06-26,Université McGill,

Tracking plurigaussian simulations,"The mathematical method called Plurigaussian Simulations was invented in France in the 1990s for simulating the internal architecture of oil reservoirs. It rapidly proved useful in other domains in the earth sciences: Mining, hydrology and history matching. In this chapter we use complex dynamic networks first developed in statistical mechanics to track the diffusion of the method within academia, using citation data from Google Scholar. Since governments and funding agencies want to know whether ideas developed in research projects have a positive effect on the economy, we also studied how plurigaussian simulations diffused from academia to industry. The literature on innovation usually focusses on patents but as there were few on plurigaussian simulations, we needed criteria for deciding whether an innovation had been adopted by industry. Three criteria were identified: • Repeat co-authorship. Many published papers were co-authored by mining or oil companies, or by consulting firms. While this demonstrates interest from industry, in some cases it seemed to be ""window-shopping"" but companies that continued to publish on this topic (i.e. ""repeat co-authors"") had clearly adopted the method. • Specialized training. Companies that wanted to build-up inhouse competency, sent their personnel for postgraduate training or to specialized short courses. • Bringing in consultants. Rather than investing the time and effort in building up competency in-house, other companies got studies carried out by consulting firms. The second criterion revealed how important master's level courses are in training geoscientists in the latest techniques. Their role in transferring knowledge to industry is undervalued in current procedures for evaluating university departments.",Armstrong M.; Mondaini A.; Camargo S.,Book,Handbook of Mathematical Geosciences: Fifty Years of IAMG,2018-06-25,Centre d'Économie Industrielle;Fundacao Getulio Vargas;Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro,Complex dynamic networks ;  Google scholar citations ;  University-industry interaction technology diffusion

Creating innovative frameworks to spur cultural change at the NASA armstrong flight research center,"Changing the culture of an organization is a monumental task that often takes years and has no set formula. Steps can be taken, however, to spur cultural change by creating spaces and infrastructure to serve as the initial driving force. A collaboration space and a bicycle sharing (bike share) program were implemented at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Armstrong Flight Research Center (AFRC) (Edwards, California) with a vision toward connecting Center personnel, and fostering collaboration and innovation. This paper discusses the steps taken, challenges faced, novel culture-change-focused design elements, lessons learned, acquired metrics, and how these initiated cultural change at AFRC. Funding was secured through the NASA Convergent Aeronautics Solutions project, key stakeholders across the center were identified and kept in the loop early in the process, research was conducted by looking externally and internally to the government, and decisions were made iteratively and in a small group. All aspects of the design of the space and the bike share program were tied to the core idea of connecting people across the center to create a collaborative and innovative culture and that core idea was uncompromised despite tight deadlines and budgets. The collaboration space and the bike share program together are an effective initial framework for innovation and collaboration. Culture change takes time, but these two frameworks are already showing signs of making a positive impact on the AFRC workforce.",Samuel A.; Carte O.; Lozano J.; Robillos T.,Conference Proceeding,IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings,2018-06-25,Armstrong Flight Research Center;NASA Ames Research Center,
An investigation of students' experiences in a K-12 invention program (Evaluation),"The InVenture Challenge is an innovation-driven experience for K-12 students that operates in partnership with an institute of higher education. Students across all grade levels and educational settings (e.g., regular, gifted, and AP classrooms in a variety of subject areas; after school programs) are eligible to participate. Generally, students work in small groups to develop an invention from problem-seeking to prototype over the course of multiple months. In the process, they present their ideas to others, solicit feedback, and iterate on their design multiple times. In the spring, students with the top inventions from their individual schools travel to Georgia Institute of Technology to pitch their inventions to judges and audience members in a statewide competition. The goal of this research is to understand the experiences of teachers and students within the program and the ways they benefit from participating. Initial research efforts have focused primarily on teachers' experiences implementing the program. Through survey, focus group, and interview data collected over the past several years, teachers have also provided their perspectives about how the program has impacted their students. Across several academic years, teachers' survey data reflects a high level of agreement that participation has had a positive impact on their students' communication and teamwork skills, enthusiasm for learning about engineering and entrepreneurship, and knowledge of the engineering design process, how products are made, how to design a sales pitch, and how to start a business. In this paper, we summarize several years of teacher data related to perceived impact on students and present our first pre-post student survey data. This student survey data will allow us to directly investigate students' experiences within the program and examine alignment with their teachers' perceptions of student impacts. Together, this research will provide a multi-faceted view of invention education's impacts on students.",Newton S.; Alemdar M.; Moore R.; Cappelli C.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2018-06-23,Georgia Institute of Technology,
Promoting neurodiversity in engineering through undergraduate research opportunities for students with ADHD,"Promoting diversity in engineering education has been a major initiative of ASEE in recent years, and may contribute to greater social equity, reduced opportunity costs, and greater creativity in the field of engineering. Indeed, there is ample evidence that the inclusion of women and minorities improves the productivity and creativity of teams. However, there is little awareness of the potential contributions of neurodiverse individuals, such as those with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ADHD has been shown to be associated with creativity, innovation, and risk-taking. While these traits are all potential assets in the field of engineering, individuals with ADHD are extremely underrepresented in engineering programs. Too often, nontraditional thinkers struggle within the confines of the traditional engineering education curriculum. Providing these students opportunities to learn in a style that is more consistent with their unique strengths may positively affect the recruitment and retention of those with diverse cognitive styles. To promote the inclusion of students with ADHD in engineering, and thereby increase the diversity of the field, a specialized Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site has been funded by the NSF Division of Engineering Education and Centers. This site provided students with ADHD an opportunity to engage in research outside the confines of the traditional engineering curriculum and interact with other students facing similar challenges. This paper presents quantitative and qualitative findings from a semi-structured interview and post-program survey of the students' experiences. Overall, the major findings suggest that participating in the program enhanced students' 1) interest in engineering research, 2) interest in pursuing graduate studies in engineering, and 3) feelings of belonging in engineering. For instance, all participants (N=10) responded either ""agree"" or ""strongly agree"" to statements reflecting that attending the REU site increased their interest in research and in pursuing graduate studies. Responses to open-ended items on the survey, as well as responses during interviews, indicated that attending the REU site enhanced students' feelings of belonging, which has been shown to positively influence persistence in engineering education. Understanding the challenges and potential of students with ADHD characteristics in engineering programs is needed to stem attrition in engineering education and promote cognitive diversity in the field. The implications of these findings for promoting inclusion and diversity in engineering and suggestions for educators to make courses more inclusive for neurodiverse students are discussed.",Hain A.; Zaghi A.; Taylor C.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2018-06-23,University of Connecticut,
Preparation of the professional engineer: Outcomes from 20 years of a multidisciplinary and cross-sectoral capstone course,"The grand challenges outlined by the National Academy of Engineers and addressed by the ABET (Accreditation Bureau for Engineering and Technology) learning outcomes reflect the changing landscape of undergraduate engineering education. Indeed, to be competitive, the next generation of engineering professionals must obtain skills and preparation beyond those in a traditional technical discipline. Accordingly, learners must principally demonstrate the ability to: understand ethics and social responsibility, develop and implement complex systems, communicate and function within multidisciplinary groups, and understand impacts of their designs in different societal and environmental contexts. Achieving these outcomes requires a pedagogy that not only holistically broadens non-technical aspects of engineering design, but provides a conducive learning environment that is responsive to the changing professional industry landscape. At our University, we have endeavored to facilitate innovation and professional efficacy by closely tying our capstone course with current industry practice. The course begins with as a traditional lecture course in parallel with the problem-based learning format during the first five weeks to rapidly prepare learners for our industry-oriented approach to project management and systems-level engineering, adopted for the remaining 25 weeks. Here, we employ a hierarchical structure that emphasizes both group and individual responsibility for a (self-specified) scope of work. Capstone projects and their associated teams are approved based on how well the nascent student-team can articulate and address the client's need; as such, many if not all projects require multidisciplinary skillsets. Thus, instruction of the capstone course follows a collaborative teaching model, one that is inherent to its success: mixed-discipline learners are co-taught by instructors hailing from respective engineering departments, selected for their broad theoretical, experimental and practical knowledge. We hope to expand in the future and bring in more representation from business, sociology, and environmental science. This paper critically assesses a multidisciplinary and cross-sectoral engineering capstone course over the last twenty years. During this time, the course structure has evolved to support three main project tracks: corporate-sponsored projects model where clients from industry propose projects for a fee; the social entrepreneurship theme where motivated learners identify opportunities for innovation emphasizing community applications; and the academic or faculty-initiated model, which draws on ideas from on-or off-campus research. Our goal is to create an environment that fosters learner innovation by transitioning students beyond immersive and experiential learning toward actual creation of real-world value, supported by activities specifically intended to foster entrepreneurially-minded learning (EML). By bolstering student contribution in this manner, learners move away from viewing the course simply as an academic exercise. In fact, many successful students obtain further project funding or employment as a direct result of their participation in a capstone project. The actual realization of these outcomes necessitates significant resources and scaffolded mentorship, fine-tuned over the many years of lessons learned. In this paper, we will articulate the major challenges and revisions to the course along with the motivation behind the current course design, so that other programs may learn from our model. Program assessment will be obtained from faculty and teaching assistant observations, as well as participant feedback.",Favaloro T.; Mantey P.; Petersen S.; Vesecky J.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2018-06-23,"University of California, Santa Cruz",
Teaching fundamentals in lasers and light technology to advanced applied optics in biology and biomedical research: Analyzing the team-teaching influence on high school students' perception of and confidence in STEM,"Laser and light technology has the potential to be the science milestone of the century. The essential use of light and laser technology in designing revolutionary devices such as quantum computers, optogenetic tools, and biomimicking light-actuator microrobots represent the inspiration behind this vision. Therefore, running classroom activities followed by advanced lectures around multidisciplinary research and innovation in optics could serve as an excellent contextual vehicle for increasing K-12 student perception of and confidence in some areas of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). In this work, we present a project facilitated in a high school biology classroom during the academic year by a team of ExPERTS (Experiential Practices in Education Research and Teaching in STEM) composed of an engineering Ph.D. student, a biology undergraduate student, and a high school Biology teacher. The team introduces laser and light technology topics related to biological and biomedical applications to high school students through inquiry-based Modules (including associated introductions, activities and assessments) with the goal of increasing student confidence in and understanding of the use of optics in STEM applications. Results and connections of pre- and post-surveys for each module implemented will be presented.",Abdolazimi V.; Ruddick J.; Ward J.; Fontecchio A.; Giduck R.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2018-06-23,Drexel University College of Engineering;School District of Philadelphia,Biology and biomedical research ;  K-12 ;  Laser and light technology ;  Optics ;  Optogenetics ;  STEM
Assessing the development of empathy and innovation attitudes in a project-based engineering design course,"To develop innovative solutions that fit end-users, engineers must understand the end-users' needs. This user-centered aspect of engineering innovation has been highlighted in recent design thinking literature, where the construct of empathy has received increasing attention. Anecdotal support has been found for the benefits of empathy in engineering, and many engineering design thinking courses today teach engineering students to empathize with end-users. However, transitioning from anecdotal to evidence-based education requires being able to measure and track the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that educators attempt to impart on students. Thus, this study measures the development of empathic tendencies and innovation attitudes in students, and explores correlations between the two. Data was collected by administering a self-report survey in January and June 2017 to 237 students participating in a global multidisciplinary design thinking course. The survey included subscales for empathic tendencies, innovation self-efficacy, and innovation interests. The responses were analyzed for differences in distribution between the two surveys, as well as for correlations between items. It was observed that the students' empathic tendencies and confidence in experimenting and associative thinking grew (p < 0.03). Furthermore, the empathic tendency scores displayed weak but statistically significant correlation with interest towards planning and research activities (p < 0.05, τb > 0.2). This study is among the first to quantify the development of empathy and innovation attitudes in engineering education. The results indirectly repeat prior research on the development of innovation capabilities in the scope of individual engineering courses. However, there are some limitations regarding the applicability of the utilized survey instruments, thus requiring further research with larger amounts of data and a mixed-methods approach to generalize the results.",Surma-Aho A.; Björklund T.; Holtta-Otto K.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2018-06-23,Aalto University,
Examining the replication - Or mutation - Processes of implementing a national model for engineering mathematics education at a new site,"This research paper investigates how a renowned national model for engineering mathematics education is adapted and adjusted for implementation within a new large public university site, and the consequences of these modifications for students, instructors, administrators, and institutions. By examining how elements of the original Wright State Model are replicated or mutated in the process of starting a pilot course, we illustrate not just the challenges inherent to creating a new course in a new place but also the ways seemingly neutral and benign objects (such as course numbers and course titles) are transformed and modified to suit local contexts. Further, we show what is lost and gained through the adaptation and conversion processes of moving an established course model from one institution to another. We argue that these negotiations and local compromises are worthy of detailed examination to understand more about the existing social organization of academic institutions in order to reveal structures that both limit and enable the success or failure of educational initiatives and innovations. This paper integrates ethnographic data, institutional artifacts, and student survey responses to demonstrate how the pilot course implementation is not a one-to-one replication of the original model; rather it is a mutation of how the course exists at Wright State. Viewing the course as a mutation enables a deeper analysis of the institutional processes required to instantiate a new educational initiative within existing systems, curricula, and infrastructures, with implications for engineering educators looking to make positive change within their home institutions.",Tsai J.; O'Connor K.; Myers B.; Sullivan J.; Reamon D.; Anderson K.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2018-06-23,College of Engineering and Applied Science;University of Colorado Boulder,Curricular change ;  Engineering mathematics ;  Ethnography ;  Intervention ;  Models ;  Mutation ;  Networks ;  Replication ;  Transformation ;  Translation ;  Wright state model
Deliverables from international cooperation on an NIH-funded biomedical engineering project in Africa,"Through the Frameworks grant provided by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Fogarty International Center, an interdisciplinary team comprising faculty members from the medical, business and engineering schools at Northwestern University (Chicago, IL) in collaboration with faculty members from the University of Ibadan, Nigeria, University of Lagos, Nigeria and University of Cape Town, South Africa have been able to record quantifiable progress in achieving the specific goals of a 5-year grant received in September 2013 for developing innovative biomedical engineering (BME) programs in Africa. Several key deliverables comprise the designing of biomedical products. For example, to improve pediatric surgical outcomes, and based upon the needs analysis performed by a local pediatric surgeon in Nigeria, an Infant Warming Device for regulating temperature during pediatric surgeries has been designed, prototyped, and tested under laboratory conditions - it is currently being prepared for clinical testing. The warmer came about as a result of identifying problems and challenges being experienced in Nigerian Hospitals by Nigerian doctors and has been developed by an international team of faculty and students from all four universities. In addition to the infant warmer, engineering, medical, and business faculty in Nigeria have worked with colleagues from the US and S. Africa to develop technologies and products for monitoring wound exudate from burn victims, crushing and storing medical needles and sharps, and housing laboratory animals for metabolic studies. These case studies, specifically the international collaborative design process used to move these solutions forward, are described in the paper. Moreover, investigators comprising African engineers, scientists, and medical doctors are working to develop a book on Biomedical Engineering for Africa. This book will address what it means to practice the BME discipline within an African context. In addition, an African-based research journal - Global Health Innovation - has been launched by the University of Cape Town through support from the Frameworks grant. The journal has the mission of advancing and disseminating knowledge on all aspects of social and technological innovation for improved health and healthcare, with an emphasis on research addressing developing settings such as those found in Africa. These deliverables, along with the process for creating them, are also described and discussed herein.",Gatchell D.; Osuntoki A.; Coker A.; Glucksberg M.; Douglas T.; Palamountain K.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2018-06-23,Kellogg School of Management Northwestern University;Northwestern University;University of Lagos;University of Ibadan;University of Cape Town,
Identifying at-risk freshmen and providing enhanced advising support through intrusive academic advising interventions,"This work in progress describes an effort to identify at-risk freshmen and provide enhanced advising support through intrusive academic advising interventions. In the report Rising Above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future, the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, and Institute of Medicine of the National Academies identified the key roles innovation and competitiveness play in ensuring the prosperity of the United States (U.S.) economy within the world. Both innovation and competitiveness depend upon the knowledge capital of highly qualified and diverse college graduates to work in STEM fields. However, the U.S. education system is failing to produce sufficient college graduates to fulfill the emerging, rapidly growing job demands within STEM fields. Our institution provides a breadth and depth of student support resources designed to improve freshman retention, yet retention rates of freshmen in engineering remained flat, year over year. New approaches for addressing retention are needed. Data was gathered on engineering students not retained to the university after one year from the past three years (2014, 2015, and 2016) first-time freshman cohorts. Analysis of the data indicated certain academic and engagement measures were predictors of attrition. Furthermore, the analysis uncovered the opportunity to refine intrusive advising principles. Research on the impact of intrusive advising reflects a connection between successful academic advising and an increase in student retention and graduation rates. Through the requirement of mandatory advising for freshmen, advisors and students can collaboratively develop strategies for engagement with resources that will promote academic success. Theories and research focusing on academic advising approaches and student engagement guide advising discussions. Alexander Astin [1], [2] developed the Theory of Student Involvement (TSI) model. With respect to academic advising effectiveness, Astin suggests ""⋯that a particular curriculum, to achieve the effects intended, must elicit sufficient student effort and investment of energy to bring about the desired learning and development [1]"". From TSI emerged the ""I-E-O Model"", which describes the influence of inputs and environment on outputs. The inputs include a student's high school GPA, SAT or ACT score, and his/her demographics. These inputs are useful in making admissions decisions. The environment describes the institutional policies, engagement opportunities, and student body. A student's involvement in purposeful and appropriate activities in his/her environment is a key factor in degree completion. The outputs are the institutional measures of retention and graduation rates. An academic advisor can serve as the communication channel for identifying appropriate and purposeful activities in which a student may engage. This study explores quantitative data on student behaviors, actions, and engagement. Data points include course enrollment or withdrawal, participation in certain programs (such as tutoring, orientation, pre-college activities), and receipt of academic warnings from faculty. Appropriate descriptive and inferential statistical analysis will be conducted during the semester in relation to the number of students enrolled from fall 2017 to spring 2018 as well as fall 2017 to fall 2018. Additionally, data from the students enrolled as freshmen in fall 2015 and fall 2016 will be considered. Ultimately, the goal of the intrusive outreach is to realize a significant improvement in freshmen retention after one year as a result of intrusive academic advising interventions. Data from the previous and current freshman classes will be used to determine where intervention should occur in future terms.",Helm J.; Coronella T.; Rooney T.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2018-06-23,Ira A.

Lean LaunchPad and customer discovery as a form of qualitative research,"In this theoretical paper, we highlight the scholarship of integration by exploring how customer discovery connects to other methodologies in engineering education research and the opportunities for using this methodology in engineering education research. As a result of the National Science Foundation's Innovation Corps (I-Corps) and I-Corps for Learning initiatives, the Lean LaunchPad®/Customer Discovery methodology has grown in popularity within academic institutions, particularly in business and entrepreneurship education. In addition, the Lean LaunchPad®/Customer Discovery approach has helped startups, individuals, academics, and students test the potential of an idea, make important decisions about the structure, value, and implementation of their projects, and develop a minimum viable product, service, or offering. While the Lean LaunchPad®/Customer Discovery approach is relatively new to the fields of business, engineering education, and entrepreneurship education, its methodological background emerges from well-established qualitative research techniques. We first describe the Lean LaunchPad®/Customer Discovery process and give examples of its current use in academia. Next, we explain the connections between the Lean LaunchPad®/Customer Discovery approach and specific forms of qualitative research like design-based research, action research, and qualitative interviewing. Finally, we offer a detailed example of how our team used the Lean LaunchPad®/Customer Discovery approach to conduct an engineering education action research project. This example serves to clarify how the Lean LaunchPad®/Customer Discovery approach can be successfully applied, validated by funding received after our use of the process to develop a program. We expect that this theoretical work will add value to individuals interested in conducting action-oriented educational research projects for two reasons. First, we show how robust qualitative research methodologies provide the foundation for a popular market research approach. Second, we give an example of using this approach in an educational context. Our motivation is to expand the breadth of methodologies available to researchers and practitioners.",Hixson C.; Ingram E.; McCord R.; Williams J.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2018-06-23,"Rose Hulman Institute Technology;Rowan University;The University of Tennessee, Knoxville",
Enhancing engineering management courses with global market concerned projects and case studies,"With the changing global business environment, engineering managers and executives need to deal with the competition related business and engineering issues constantly. They need to have a vision while working on their management and engineering tasks and making various decisions. The objective of this paper is to discuss the ways to educate and train engineering management students to sharpen their abilities in making good decisions and creating a vision in a competitive environment. This paper will also discuss the effect of embedding the consideration of marketing, branding, value creation, innovation, global location characteristics, policies related engineering issues, and competition into class case studies and projects. The purpose is to teach engineering management students how to make good decisions with a broader business and engineering vision while managing engineering and business operations. In this research, the examples discussed include a term case study assigned to students to develop an investment strategy for a top 5 brand value company to increase market share in the next top global smartphone market, a term project to design and develop a transparent factory in the US locations to promote Made-in-USA approach, and a term project to consider moving existing engineering and manufacturing activities in a top smart phone company from abroad back to the US locations for following the Made-in-USA trend. The purpose of using these term case studies and projects in engineering management related classes is to lead students to realize the importance of value creation, market dominance, understanding of competition, innovative approaches, good handling of global economy and policies related issues for successful engineering operations and decision-making.",Teng S.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2018-06-23,William States Lee College of Engineering,
Development of creativity of engineering students: A cause for concern?,"This research paper describes the study of how instruction in the use of an idea generation heuristic may differently influence the creativity performance of first year, third year, and postgraduate students from the same institution. Innovation and creativity are increasingly becoming important skills for engineers, but some students suffer design fixation and are unable to effectively produce solution ideas. An experiment was devised whereby students received instruction in use of an idea generation heuristic, and then spent time generating ideas to a real-world engineering-related problem. Results showed that first year students performed better than third year students, who in turn performed better than postgraduate students. These outcomes suggest that if idea generation heuristics are to be introduced to curriculum, they may be most effective if introduced in first year of study when students may be more willing to accept and utilise such creativity techniques.",Valentine A.; Belski I.; Hamilton M.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2018-06-23,RMIT University,
Library and student innovation center: Makerspace!,"The College of Engineering and Applied Science together with the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Education, and the University of Wyoming Libraries have developed a Library/Student Innovation Center (CSIC/SIC) makerspace, in order to spark student innovation, creativity, and design skills. In May 2012, Governor Mead, the State legislature, and the Wyoming Governor's Energy, Engineering, and STEM Integration Taskforce articulated a vision to propel the College of Engineering and Applied Science (CEAS) and the University of Wyoming to the realms of ""excellence in instruction, research, and service."" Part of this initiative included an active learning ""makerspace"" in the new Engineering Education and Research Building (EERB). Makerspaces employ technology along with hands-on education to spark student innovation, creativity, design, and entrepreneurship. The UW Libraries have graciously provided 2500 square feet of space to develop a prototype Library Innovation Center (LIC) during the Fall 2016 semester. Lessons learned and equipment purchased will form the basis of the Student Innovation Center (SIC) planned for the EERB. Groundbreaking for the EERB was October 7, 2016 with a scheduled completion of Spring 2019. The purpose of the LIC/SIC is to provide experiential learning space for STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math) students. The LIC/SIC provides a location for students to explore ideas, complete class projects, or pursue an entrepreneurial innovation. Also, the space is available to conduct classes and workshops. The space is coordinated and managed by an onsite specialist. The LIC/SIC planning team consists of an interdisciplinary group of faculty members and students with a common interest: hands-on, innovative learning. In this paper, we provide detailed information about developing a makerspace, including equipment selection, staffing, funding, day-to-day operations, and lessons learned. This paper serves as a useful guide for other institutions that are considering setting up a makerspace.",Barrett S.; Dousay T.; Kerr T.; Schmidt L.; Gellis B.; Ballard J.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2018-06-23,University of Idaho;University of Wyoming,
Creating faculty buy-in for ethics-across-the-curriculum: Year one of developing an ethics curriculum in an undergraduate biological engineering program,"This paper reports the first two phases of an on-going, multi-year project that seeks to create an integrated ethics curriculum for undergraduate Biological Engineering (BE) majors at a large, public university. Our objective is to create an exemplar process that encourages engineering faculty members to contribute to, and develop ownership of, the ethics curriculum. Literature in engineering education research has called attention to faculty buy-in as one of the key indicators of successful educational innovation. Scholars of ethics education also note engineering faculty's attitude as a crucial factor in meaningful integration of ethics in the engineering curriculum. Informed by the findings of engineering education and engineering ethics literature, our project team engages the BE faculty in an ethics curriculum development initiative with five phases: 1) need assessment interviews, 2) faculty workshops, 3) curriculum design, 4) curriculum implementation, and 5) project assessment and improvement. This paper reports in detail the first two phases of this on-going project. First, one of the authors conducted semi-structured interviews with instructors of BE courses to understand their present approaches to ethics education and the perceived need for improvement. Second, authors of this paper organized three interactive workshops, in which the BE faculty and our project team explored frameworks of ethical reasoning, pedagogy for ethics education, and ethics-related learning objectives. These engagement activities resulted in a list of 11 ethics related learning objectives agreed upon by the BE faculty; these learning objectives formed the basis of an ethics-across-the-curriculum experience for BE students. Informed by the interview findings and the list of ethics learning objectives, the authors continue to work with a team of BE instructors to develop appropriate course contents, instructional materials, and delivery methods in four successive courses that spread across the junior and senior years of the BE curriculum. The design, implementation, and assessment of the ethics curriculum will be reported in future publications.",Tang X.; Catchmark J.; Mendieta E.; Litzinger T.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2018-06-23,College of Engineering;Pennsylvania State University,
The entrepreneurial engineer: A quantitative analysis of personality factors in the social cognitive career theory,"Which personality traits foster Entrepreneurship in Engineering? What implications for Engineering/Entrepreneurship Education can be derived? Until today, most of the research about Personality and Entrepreneurship compared Entrepreneurs to Managers. This work focuses on Engineers and combines two validated constructs: the Big Five Personality Traits (BFPT: Openness to new experiences, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Emotional Stability [1]) and the Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT [2]). The research question is: How can we describe the relationship between the BFPT and SCCT constructs? We conducted a (mainly quantitative) online-survey (n=465) among Alumni of the Stanford School of Engineering who graduated between 1 and 17 years ago and who had successfully the course ME203: Design and Manufacturing. over 20 percent of the respondents had founded a venture. Results show that three out of the five personality traits have a significant positive relationship to certain SCCT constructs: a. Openness to new experiences and Extraversion are correlated to Entrepreneurial Self Efficacy, Entrepreneurial Intention, Entrepreneurial Outcome Expectations, Innovation Self Efficacy and Entrepreneurial Learning Experiences, and b. Emotional Stability correlated to Innovation Self Efficacy and Entrepreneurial Learning Experiences. Finally, we draw practical implications of these relationships for Entrepreneurship and Engineering Education, while at the same time keeping in mind that you cannot just ""make"" someone an Entrepreneur or change his or her personality. This paper is an explorative starting point that results in various findings that suggest future research. We recommend focusing on the three personality traits that showed significant results.",Szeli L.; Gilmartin S.; Chen H.; Sheppard S.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2018-06-23,Stanford Engineering,

"Perceptions of the civil engineering body of knowledge outcomes by senior students: Effect of activities, internships, and career goals","In the process of updating the Civil Engineering Body of Knowledge Second Edition (BOK2), the ASCE is gathering input from many stakeholders. This paper explores the opinions of students majoring in civil engineering who had completed three to four years of their Bachelor's degree at a research-intensive, public institution and were enrolled in a course where they were learning about the BOK2. Students completed an individual homework assignment where they explored the BOK2; responses from this assignment in 2016 and 2017 were examined (n=l 17). When asked to identify the five outcomes that they believed would be the most important in their future civil engineering careers, problem solving, teamwork, communication, and ethics were listed the most often. The outcomes most commonly identified as the least important were humanities, social science, and experiments. The frequency that some outcomes were identified as the most and least important differed based on the students' sub-discipline of interest for their future careers and whether they had engaged in an internship or participated in Engineers Without Borders (EWB). For example, 47% of EWB participants rated sustainability among the top five most important outcomes, compared to only 19% of non-EWB participants. A higher percentage of those with internship experiences rated teamwork in the top five important outcomes, and a lower percentage rated attitudes among the five least important outcomes. Those with future career interests in construction engineering rated project management in the top five important outcomes with higher frequency; students with structures career interests believed design to be more important; fewer students with water and/or environmental career aspirations rated globalization among the least important outcomes. Content analysis of an open-ended discussion of the BOK2 found that the majority of students (93%) had overall positive statements. Some promoted the inclusion of creativity and innovation as a new outcome. Many commented that they were surprised that attitudes were included, but also deemed attitudes very important. A number liked the emphasis on sustainability, and encouraged even greater focus on this outcome. A few students would have liked more discussion on humanitarian needs and themes. The paper concludes with recommendations for how to use the BOK in teaching.",Bielefeldt A.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2018-06-23,College of Engineering and Applied Science,
Creating and assessing an upper division additive manufacturing course and laboratory to enhance undergraduate research and innovation,"This NSF IUSE project is on the Exploration and Design Tier and the Engaged Student Learning Track. It is aimed at better preparing the country's professional workforce in the renaissance of U.S. skilled manufacturing by creating new personnel proficient in additive manufacturing (AM). AM is mainstream; it has the potential to bring jobs back to the U.S. and add to the nation's global competitiveness. AM is the process of joining materials to make objects from 3D data in a layer upon layer fashion. The objectives are to develop, assess, revise, and disseminate an upper division course and laboratory, ""Additive Manufacturing,"" and to advance undergraduate and K-12 student research and creative inquiry activities as well as faculty expertise at three diverse participating universities: Texas Tech, California State Northridge, and Kansas State. This research/pedagogical team contains a mechanical engineering professor at each university to develop and teach the course, as well as a sociologist trained in K-12 outreach, course assessment, and human subjects research to accurately determine the effects on K-12 and undergraduate students. The proposed course will cover extrusion-based, liquid-based, and powder-based AM processes. For each technology, fundamentals, applications, and advances will be discussed. Students will learn solutions to AM of polymers, metals, and ceramics. Two lab projects will be built to provide hands-on experiences on a variety of state-of-the-art 3D printers. To stimulate innovation, students will design, fabricate, and measure test parts, and will perform experiments to explore process limits and tackle real world problems. They will also engage K-12 students through video demonstrations and mentorship, thus developing presentation skills. Through the project, different pedagogical techniques and assessment tools will be utilized to assess and improve engineering education at both the undergraduate and K-12 levels through varied techniques: i) undergraduate module lesson plans that are scalable to K-12 levels, ii) short informational video lessons created by undergraduates for K-12 students with accompanying inperson mentorship activities at local high schools and MakerSpaces, iii) pre- and post-test assessments of undergraduates' and K-12 participating students' AM knowledge, skills, and perceptions of self-efficacy, and iv) focus groups to learn about student concerns/learning challenges. We will also track students institutionally and into their early careers to learn about their use of AM technology professionally.",Maloney P.; Li B.; Zhang M.; Cong W.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2018-06-23,"Texas Tech University;California State University, Northridge;Kansas State University",
Work in progress: Flexibility and professional preparation via a multidisci-plinary engineering curriculum,"This paper reports on one institution's work-in-progress to build innovation and creativity into a flexible, ABET accredited undergraduate Engineering B.S. degree that provides a variety of choices to undergraduate engineering students. The new Engineering Plus degree has a core set of required foundational courses in engineering, a multi-year design sequence, and allows for self-defined pathways. The new curriculum also offers three defined degree pathways that have been chosen based on an examination of student ""fate"" data: secondary education, pre-medical, and environmental studies, with additional pathways planned for the near future. The fate analysis examined the paths of students who were enrolled in an engineering or STEM major in one year and samples their major choice in the following year. This analysis maps the flow of students into and out of the major with demographic slicers to more closely understand these inmigration and out-migration choices. This paper will detail the development of the program and its related research inquiry which includes a qualitative comparison of the students who are drawn to this new approach to engineering.",Salzman N.; Stieha V.; Moll A.; Lighty J.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2018-06-23,College of Engineering;Boise State University,
Maker education in a Sino-American joint institute: Taking sichuan university - Pittsburgh institute as an example,"Sichuan University-Pittsburgh Institute (SCUPI) is a new academic entity jointly established by Sichuan University (SCU) and the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt), which is one of five large-scale partnerships between an American and a Chinese university. Currently, three undergraduate degree programs are offered: Industrial Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. From the interactions between the instructors and students, it has been identified that Chinese students tend to be very focused on theoretical learning, while their hands-on abilities and creativity are relatively limited. To stimulate imagination, innovation, creativity in Chinese engineering undergraduates, SCUPI set up a student-run-design-build-play space, named as Makerspace, in April 2016. This article introduces in detail as a start-up academic institute, how SCUPI, learning from excellent makerspaces world-wide, launched innovative maker education activities based on the existing resources and characteristics of Chinese students. These activities include: 1. Regular technical lectures for training makers 2. Hands-on projects based on engineering courses 3. Supporting students in STEM competitions; 4. Involved in feature events and outreach activities of SCUPI 5. Guiding students to take part in academic research 6. Establishment of an online maker sharing community. As a result, SCUPI has initially created a dynamic maker education system based on this small-scale makerspace, which provides guidance to brainstorming, CAD model simulation, prototype manufacturing and hands-on practice. The organization, facilities, challenges, and planning of Makerspace are also presented to guide others in the creation of similar organizations.",Liang D.; Lin S.; Liu L.; Chen W.; Du J.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2018-06-23,Sichuan University - Pittsburgh Institute,
Scaling up or scale-making? Examining sociocultural factors in a new model for engineering mathematics education,"Researchers have pointed to Wright State's Introductory Mathematics for Engineering Applications course as a model for undergraduate engineering education curricular reform. The work behind the Wright State Model (WSM) demonstrates that adoption of its introductory course can increase engineering student retention, motivation, and academic success (N. Klingbeil, Mercer, Rattan, Raymer, & Reynolds, 2006; N. Klingbeil & Bourne, 2013), and can remove ""the first-year bottleneck"" associated with the traditional first-year calculus sequence (Ohland, Yuhasz, & Sill, 2004; N. Klingbeil & Bourne, 2013; Long, Abrams, Barclay, & Paulson, 2016). Klingbeil & Bourne (2013) point to the promise of the Wright State Model in engineering education reform, claiming that the model ""is designed to be readily adopted by any institution employing a traditional engineering curriculum⋯ should it be sufficiently scaled⋯ the Wright State approach has the potential to double the number of our nation's engineering graduates, while both maintaining their quality and increasing their diversity"" (p. 10, emphasis added). In our analysis, we reconsider the ""diffusion"" notion of ""scaling"" as it is typically used in educational research (McDonald, Keesler, Kauffman, & Schneider, 2006), proposing instead that innovations and adaptations are better conceived in terms of what educational anthropologists have called ""scale-making"" (Nespor, 2004). According to this perspective, scale-making is an active process of forming connections between, on one hand, new practices such as the WSM course, and on the other hand, existing networks that operate at a broader spatiotemporal scale-such as classrooms, course scheduling, course numbering, curricular flowcharts, and instructional staffing and student registration practices. This paper draws on a qualitative dataset of student responses to biweekly ""reflection questions"" integrated into routine course activity in a pilot implementation of a Wright State-like Engineering Mathematics course. Alongside auto-ethnographic data from the course instructor and coordinator, this dataset illustrates the transformations involved in the scale-making process, and enables tracing the consequences of these transformations for the identities of people and social collectives involved in the course.",Tsai J.; O'Connor K.; Myers B.; Sullivan J.; Reamon D.; Anderson K.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2018-06-23,University of Colorado Boulder,Curricular reform ;  Educational anthropology ;  Engineering mathematics ;  Scale-making ;  Spatiotemporal scales ;  Wright State Model
Multidisciplinary research efforts in post-earthquake civil infrastructure reconnaissance,"To address existing challenges with filtering and classification of post-earthquake structural damage images, the authors are engaged in a multidisciplinary project to develop and train a machine-learning algorithm that identifies relevant photographs and assigns damage tags to those images. The research team is predominantly comprised of undergraduate students and is led by a structural engineering and a computer science faculty. While machine-learning algorithms have been successfully used for image tagging in a variety of fields (health care, manufacturing, etc.), the extension of this approach for earthquake reconnaissance is only just beginning. As such, the creation and development of this tool is a new and dynamic project-based learning experience for both the students and faculty involved. This collaborative project emphasizes student initiative and innovation where they are active in all development stages of the tool ranging from collection and tagging of earthquake damage images, coding and testing the machine-learning algorithm, to writing papers for and presenting at conferences. In addition, the unique nature of this project exposes students to a field and possible career path they may not have encountered in their typical course of study. The authors provide a comprehensive discussion of the results of faculty and student surveys/ interviews and conclude by highlighting some of the greatest benefits of the multidisciplinary project. They also point out lessons learned engaging in a project with a large scope, diverse experts (who have limited knowledge of the partnering disciplines), and a number of undergraduate students who began as novices in their respective research area.",Bergquist J.; Behrouzi A.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2018-06-23,"California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo",
The impact of EAC-ABET program criteria on civil engineering curricula,"Civil engineering programs accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET (EAC-ABET) must comply with program criteria developed by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). Requirements stipulated in the program criteria are limited to the areas of curricular topics and faculty qualifications. There is a perception that innovation, flexibility, and creativity in civil engineering curriculums are stifled by the EAC-ABET program criteria. The goals of this study are to determine if the civil engineering program criteria (and indirectly ASCE's Body of Knowledge) have 1) hindered innovation and 2) standardized civil engineering curriculums. A curriculum study was performed of 86 EAC-ABET accredited civil engineering programs in the United States. The study included programs from all 50 states; small and large; public and private; and research and teaching focused. For uniformity in the study and because the majority of civil engineering programs use a semester credit hour system, only programs with semester credit hours were analyzed. A database of graduation requirements was created that indexed courses in categories corresponding to the EAC-ABET civil engineering program criteria. Innovation in civil engineering curriculums was addressed by examining the required number of credit hours in civil engineering electives, technical electives, civil engineering courses not linked to the program criteria, and math and science electives. The degree of standardization of civil engineering curriculums was investigated by comparing the 86 civil engineering programs to a benchmark civil engineering program of study derived from 2002 ABET data. since 2002, the average number of credit hours required for a civil engineering degree decreased from 130.4 to 128.6 and the number of elective engineering credit hours increased from 11.0 to 19.0. The study concluded that civil engineering programs use unique methods and courses to meet the EAC-ABET program criteria, and during the period 2002-2017, the nation's civil engineering programs gravitated further from a standardized curriculum.",Swenty B.; Swenty M.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2018-06-23,University of Evansville;Virginia Military Institute,
Creating and scaling an evidence-based faculty development program,"This evidence-based practice paper will explore a successful faculty development program. For more effective teaching and learning in undergraduate engineering education, there is a strong need for evidence-based faculty professional development to shift from instructor-centered teaching to student-centered, active learning, which is more effective [1]. The NSF's Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) program funded a large-scale faculty development program at a large, public university which uses a train-the-trainer approach, similar to Pimmel, et al., to engage faculty in a year-long modeling program with a semester of eight biweekly workshops, followed by a semester of six biweekly Community of Practice innovation discussions. Here, we describe the creation, scaling, and evaluation of this evidence-based faculty development program. More specifically, we outline the benefits and barriers to faculty development; structure and management; strategies, topics, and materials; assessment; and lessons learned and takeaways. In the ""benefits and barriers"" component, the foundational research by Prince, Freeman, Smith, and others in the area of engagement and active learning is explored as well as how the represented university addressed barriers to implementation. The ""structure and management"", section provides a program overview in more detail, including recruitment, organization, and workshop and community of practice structure. The ""strategies, topics, and materials"" component describes the project's models of change, including Rogers' model of Diffusion of Innovation and Coburn's model of sustainable innovation scaling. Links to all workshop materials on topics such as learning objectives, Bloom's taxonomy, interactive classes, implementing active learning, cooperative learning, student motivation, and inclusive learning environments are included. The ""assessment"" section provides an overview of how the faculty development program was evaluated. Specifically, the instruments and the outcomes from the instruments are explored. Key lessons learned from the project as well as important points about support and sustainability are highlighted. In summary, this paper outlines not only evidence-based strategies for the classroom but the structure, implementation, scaling, and evaluation of a faculty development program based on lessons learned from a successful, large-scale example.",Ankeny C.; Mayled L.; Ross L.; Hjelmstad K.; Krause S.; Middleton J.; Culbertson R.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2018-06-23,Northwestern University;Arizona State University,
Exploring how engineering internships and undergraduate research experiences inform and influence college students' career decisions and future plans,"Does engagement in high impact practices such as technical internships and undergraduate research influence engineering students' career decisions and future plans? And how is learning that comes from these high impact practices related to ""school learning""? These high impact educational practices have been shown to increase the rates of student engagement and retention in higher education. While access to and participation in these activities is often unsystematic across various institutions, these practices have been shown to benefit college students with diverse backgrounds and learner qualities. This paper establishes a context for understanding the characteristics and attitudes of students who participate in internships and undergraduate research by drawing from analyses of the first administration of the Engineering Majors Survey (EMS), a longitudinal study designed to examine engineering students' career objectives related to creativity and innovation, and the experiences and attitudes that might influence those goals. In addition, using interview data from product development interns at a single engineering firm, we add insights into the specific skills that interns identify as learning in their internship and suggest connections between school-and-work learning. The more general picture of the impact of internship and research experiences (from the EMS), complemented with a ""deep dive"" into the learning that happens in internship experiences (from the interviews) provides a solid starting point for future exploration of how high impact practices such as internships and research experiences might be better integrated into a student's educational development.",Powers K.; Chen H.; Prasad K.; Gilmartin S.; Sheppard S.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2018-06-23,Ford Motor Company;Stanford University;SKG Analysis,
Maintaining excellence in undergraduate education: The faculty development seminars of the baylor university school of engineering & computer science (ECS) over the last six years,"""How does a consistently ranked undergraduate engineering and computer science program retain its excellence in undergraduate education, while also aspiring to become an outstanding research institution?"" This is a question we posed in 2011, when a series of faculty development seminars were begun as one part of a series of innovations in education made in the School of Engineering & Computer Science (ECS) at Baylor University. It is a question that is of interest to many universities. Excellence in teaching has always been a hallmark of Baylor. A recent growth in the graduate program prompted the School of ECS to develop a strategy to help faculty, especially research active faculty, see the importance of classroom teaching and to develop classroom skills. This paper will document the original plan to provide tools to enable faculty to grow in both their research programs as well as undergraduate education, focusing on the series of Faculty Development Seminars (FDSs) and end-of-semester workshops held every year since 2011. The purpose for this work has not changed - as we aspire to encourage innovation in our classrooms and instill a greater appreciation for Baylor, we must, ourselves, continue to grow in our development as faculty, modeling the innovation and appreciation we teach in the very processes by which we teach. We will document the FDSs conducted to date, and provide a longitudinal assessment of the changes introduced through an evaluation of the ""before"" and ""after"" courses modified as a result of this work at Baylor University. We will also document the long-term benefits to the School, and will generalize these lessons learned to be adopted/adapted by anyone else.",Fry C.; Van Treuren K.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2018-06-23,Baylor University,

Growing entrepreneurial mindset in interdisciplinary student engineers: Experiences of a project-based engineering program,"Engineering education models have recently embraced the entrepreneurial mindset as a desired outcome of undergraduate engineering education. Interdisciplinary active learning strategies have been suggested as an effective pedagogy for engaging student engineers in undergraduate engineering education. Recent research suggests that active, social learning in context can lead to improvements in learner innovation, problem-solving, curiosity, retention and accessibility of knowledge, value-creation, and other desired learning outcomes. Much of the recent adoption of active and collaborative learning, self-directed learning, problem-based and project-based learning (PBL), peer to peer learning, and other similar learning strategies are aimed at developing innovative and entrepreneurial mindset skills, but they have been limited to Capstone Design courses. Our aim is to develop the entrepreneurial mindset much earlier in the student engineers' undergraduate education. The Iron Range Engineering program is entrepreneurial in nature, based on continuous improvement, self-directed learning, and reflective practice. Our student engineers learn in context, by applying technical engineering knowledge in project teams working on industry-sourced projects, each of the four semesters of their junior and senior years. In addition, freshman and sophomores enrolled in pre-engineering studies in a closely aligned community college are included in the culture, many activities, and teaching staff of the upper division program. Drawing from the Kern Family Foundation's Engineering Unleashed program and Innovating Curriculum with Entrepreneurial Mindset (ICE) workshops, faculty in the program were introduced to the entrepreneurial mindset in the summer of 2017. In the Fall, 2017 semester, they developed and piloted several entrepreneurial-minded learning (EML) modules across the curriculum of our program (approx. 95 students in lower and upper divisions), ranging from Statics in Sophomore year, to Entrepreneurship and Statistics in the Junior year, and Three-Phase and Signals and Systems for the Seniors, among others. Entrepreneurial Mindset was also reinforced in Design class and applied in project work. This paper describes the experiences of faculty and students in the implementation of entrepreneurial mindset modules adopted in our program, as well as preliminary results of this rapid deployment in an interdisciplinary engineering program. We use a case study format to report auto-ethnographic stories from both faculty and student perspectives. Early results are promising. After two semesters of simultaneous deployment of entrepreneurial mindset across the curriculum, faculty are engaged and working collaboratively to improve and extend this type of entrepreneurial learning even further into the program. The impact on ABET and KEEN outcomes are addressed. Student feedback is also positive. The pervasiveness of the application of entrepreneurial mindset is present in student reflections, project technical documents, design reviews, oral exams, and other student work. The entrepreneurial mindset has become part of the culture of our program in a short time, which we view as a positive outcome. The experiences of the participating faculty members are presented in the paper, as well as student reflections on the application of entrepreneurial mindset in their courses and design projects. Planned next steps are also addressed in the paper.",Pluskwik E.; Leung E.; Lillesve A.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2018-06-23,Minnesota State University;IRE,
"Scholarship program initiative via recruitment, innovation, and transformation (SPIRIT): SSTEM program initiatives and early results","This paper describes the structure, project initiatives, and early results of the NSF S-STEM funded SPIRIT: Scholarship Program Initiative via Recruitment, Innovation, and Transformation program at Western Carolina University (WCU). SPIRIT is a scholarship program focused on building an interdisciplinary engineering learning community involved in extensive peer and faculty mentoring, vertically-integrated Project Based Learning (PBL), and undergraduate research experiences. The program has provided twenty-six scholarships and academic resources to a diverse group of engineering and engineering technology students. Results from several project initiatives have been promising. Recruitment efforts have resulted in a demographically diverse group of participants whose retention rates within the program have held at 82%. A vibrant learning community has organically developed where participants are provided both academic and non-academic support across several majors and grade classes. since May 2014, SPIRIT undergraduate research projects have resulted in forty-five presentations at seven different undergraduate and professional conferences. Twenty-seven PBL and five integrated open-ended design challenges have been completed, involving several corporate sponsors and encompassing a wide-range of engineering topics. Results from a ninety-question participant survey revealed several perceived program strengths and areas of possible improvement. Overall, the participants agreed or strongly agreed that the program had been a positive experience (4.0/4.0) and had helped them to prepare for a career in engineering (3.8/4.0). Undergraduate research activities conducted through the program have helped the participants to understand the steps involved in research processes (3.8/4.0), to appreciate the need for a combination of analysis and hands-on skills (4.0/4.0), and to become more resilient toward academic challenges and obstacles (3.8/4.0). The program's learning community helped participants build relationships with other students outside of their major (3.1/4.0) as compared to normal course communities. Several participants believed that they were more comfortable with seeking advice from upper class students within the program (3.7/4.0) as compared to upper class students outside the program (2.7/4.0). Vertically-integrated PBL activities helped participants in understanding project management techniques (3.8/4.0), teaming techniques (3.7/4.0), and to assume a leadership role on projects (3.6/4.0). Indicated areas of program improvement included the desire and need for a system of peerreview for the students' undergraduate research papers; a perceived hindrance to benefit from ""journaling"" about their program experiences (3.6/4.0); and a need for continued strengthening of activities associated with graduate school application processes as well as preparations for job interviews and applications. This paper presents details of the program initiatives, a compilation of survey results with necessary discussion, and areas of possible improvement going forward.",Ferguson C.; Yan Y.; Kaul S.; Yanik P.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2018-06-23,Western Carolina University,
Student innovation and persistence in STEM majors: What works and what doesn't for community college students,"There is a critical need for more students with engineering and science majors to enter into, persist, and graduate from postsecondary institutions. Increasing the diversity in engineering and science is also a profound identified need. According to national statistics, the largest groups of underrepresented minority students in engineering and science attend United States public higher education institutions and in particular the community colleges. Recent research has indicated that students from these populations who are strong problem solvers, and who understand how to seek assistance and navigate college campuses, are most likely persist to degree completion. Accordingly, this research examined a sample of non-traditional college students enrolled in science and engineering programs in six urban community colleges to determine (a) the types and frequency of support practices they utilized, (b) how such practices influenced their achievement, persistence and transfer status to four-year colleges and universities, and (c) how in turn their propensity for innovation and creative problem solving affected such choices and persistence. The study analyzed the impact of pedagogical support practices-practices designed to foster successful transfer from community college to four-year colleges and universities, and how students' innovative capability affected such transfer capacity. The goals were: (a) to understand whether particular pedagogical support practices were effective in offering non-traditional students a program that enabled them to remain in engineering and science majors and to transfer to a four-year college or university, and (b) to determine if students' propensity for innovative problem solving influenced use of pedagogical practices and ultimately, transfer persistence. The research targeted four research questions: (1) What are the patterns of pedagogical practices that community colleges employ to enhance students' transfer success in engineering and science? (2) How do students' creative and innovative problem-solving approaches influence the choices that they make in using pedagogical support practices? (3) What are the impacts of pedagogical practices and differences among pedagogical practices, on persistence toward students' transfer to colleges and universities? (4) How do students' creative and innovative problem-solving approaches influence their persistence toward transfer to engineering and science programs at four-year universities? This research is ongoing and involves a two-stage study in which in stage one, the types of pedagogical support practices used in community colleges were analyzed and taxonomized at four community colleges. Results of this part of research led to the delineation and refining of three categories of student pedagogical support: (1) College attending support, (2) Program planning and execution support, and (3) Classroom and program performance support. These categories led to development and refinement of a college level pedagogical practice taxonomy and inventory which was used in stage two of the research in which data was collected on 2476 community college students in STEM majors. The intent of stage two of the research is to determine the role of students' creativity and propensity of innovation had on their persistence and the impact that use of particular pedagogical practices had on their persistence, creativity and propensity for innovation in STEM. This work is ongoing and 6 community colleges are now involved in the study. Structural equation models (SEMs) have been developed and updated with multiple rounds of data collection. These models have been used for data analyses with one containing grade point average (as a proxy for achievement) as the outcome of interest and the second with engineering creativity and propensity for innovation as the outcome of interest, both of which address the study's research questions. Thus far the two models indicate that use of pedagogical practices impact students' creativity and propensity for innovation and propensity for innovation impacts students' achievement (with GPA as a proxy.) Notably, students' background characteristics also have pronounced impacts on the two outcomes of interest. In addition to informing engineering education research, this research informs community college faculty and student affairs personnel on which support practices best support students in STEM majors to transfer to colleges and universities and how students' creativity and propensity for innovation affects such transfer persistence.",Ragusa G.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2018-06-23,University of Southern California,
Examining engineering writing instruction at a large research university through the lens of writing studies,"Recognizing challenges to developing undergraduate engineering students' writing, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign College of Engineering invited instructional innovation proposals to tackle this issue. Bringing together faculty and graduate students from engineering and writing studies, our team proposed first researching current undergraduate writing instruction in engineering at our large research university. We applied a mixed-methods approach, including administering surveys, conducting discourse-based interviews, collecting course documents, and analyzing curricular pathways. Our team also examined best practices found in writing studies research. We found that current writing assignments are rarely well aligned with professional genres, that current writing instruction often does not employ best practices from the writing studies literature, and that departmental curricula do not distribute writing across the four-year programs. Our findings suggest the potential for substantive writing instruction improvements in our College of Engineering. In this paper, we document our findings and propose a path to improving writing instruction for undergraduate engineering students, beginning with educating our engineering faculty about best practices and helping them implement those practices in their classes.",Yoritomo J.; Turnipseed N.; Cooper S.; Elliott C.; Gallagher J.; Popovics J.; Prior P.; Zilles J.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2018-06-23,The Grainger College of Engineering,
Professional development for high school guidance counselors to facilitate pre-college STEM Preparation (RTP),"Research has shown that successful post-secondary study in engineering often depends upon pre-college coursetaking in advanced mathematics and physics. Many high school students rely upon the guidance of their school counselors to select appropriate coursework to prepare them for their intended careers. School counselors are uniquely positioned to provide a realistic alignment of aspirations and prerequisite courses needed to succeed in a particular field. However, school counseling for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) career pathways has often been limited, particularly for students in high needs schools. This study reports the results of a university-based professional development intervention for school counselors, where participants engaged in training in academic preparation for engineering study, outreach opportunities, bridge programs, as well as the variety of engineering disciplines accessible to students. University faculty in engineering and science education designed and implemented the workshop. Preliminary data from select counselor participants (N=ll) indicated that few had teaching experience before becoming a counselor, they advised an average of 251 students/year, they had little knowledge of the Next Generation Science Standards, and they could not differentiate among engineering disciplines. Most spent the majority of their professional time performing college counseling. They reported that women and minorities experience barriers to participation because of lack of knowledge of engineering pathways. Participants in the workshop improved their knowledge of engineering bridge programs and admissions, knowledge of the importance of specific high school coursework to improve success in post-secondary engineering, and knowledge of the importance of outreach participation to promote student interest in engineering. Qualitative data were analyzed to provide insights on improving the accessibility of post-secondary engineering for high school students, particularly those in high needs schools. Findings to date indicate professional development for school counselors is a promising intervention for recruiting and preparing students for engineering careers, an essential goal for maintaining technological innovation and economic vitality in the region and beyond.",Gearns R.; Kelly A.; Bugallo M.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2018-06-23,Stony Brook University,
"I lead, therefore i am: The impact of student-mentor leadership opportunities on STEM identity development and sustainability","The national imperative to increase the production of computer science and engineering professionals has garnered the attention of both public and private sectors of the economy. As such, private companies, such as Verizon have begun to fund what they call Innovation in Learning (VIL) initiatives that aim to increase participation in these fields. Initiatives such as these, also recognize the need to diversify the engineering workplace by focusing specifically on engaging, inspiring, and motivating underrepresented minority (URM) youth by exposing them to engineering and other STEM concepts. During summer 2017, a southeastern university participated in hosting one of the seventeen Verizon sponsored STEM Camps. The university hosted 144 URM middle school boys for three weeks on campus to explore engineering habits of mind, engineering design principles, and computer science application development fundamentals. The camp was primarily facilitated by fourteen student mentors. One of the principle elements of the camp was to have mentors that reflected the demographics of the student population. As such, the mentor demographics consisted of 12 URM male mentors and 2 URM female mentors. Upon conclusion of the summer camp all of the student mentors were asked to participate in an open-ended survey that inquired about their experiences as studentmentors. The research questions guiding this study were: What role does race and gender have on the development of student mentor relationships? What are the implications of those mentor relationships on STEM identity development of the student-mentors? These research questions were answered through the use of thematic analysis, yielding two main themes: 1) barriers and connections associated with race and gender and 2) development of role identity - specifically the sub-constructs of performance/competence and interest. The results of this study suggest that engaging in mentoring relationships, while motivated by altruistic desires, strengthened STEM role identity development of the student-mentors. Previous literature has demonstrated that salient STEM identity development can contribute to persistence in these fields.

The effects of remote laboratory implementation on freshman engineering students' experience,"Today, learning in the engineering laboratory takes place via face-to-face and distance modes, the latter via the internet. Learning of laboratory skills in any mode of laboratory is influenced by the interactions that occur between the students, instructors and the equipment in the laboratory. Recent innovations have focused on developing new remotely controlled laboratories for various disciplines in engineering studies. These laboratories focus purely on technical aspects and may struggle to provide an environment for the development of personal and professional skills that are also a critical part of an engineering student's education. In this research, quantitative and qualitative surveys were conducted at two Australian institutions to measure first-year students' interactions and capturing their experience in these two contrasting laboratory modes. Quantitative survey data showed that students were more satisfied and valued social interactions more in the remotely controlled laboratory than in the face-to-face laboratory. By contrast qualitative responses revealed that their first preference was still face-to-face laboratories because they valued the importance of gaining hands-on experience of the experiment, working in teams and under an instructor's guidance as an engineering student. Students also preferred remote laboratory work to be introduced at a later stage in their engineering studies when they are conceptually more capable and experienced.",Lal S.; Lucey A.; Lindsay E.; Treagust D.; Mocerino M.; Long J.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2018-06-23,Curtin University;Deakin University;Charles Sturt University,
MEERCat: A case study of how faculty-led research initiatives gave rise to a cross-departmental research center with potential to inform local policy,"This work-in-progress paper presents a case study at a large Midwestern university where two faculty-led initiatives resulted in the creation of a cross-departmental center, the Mechanical Engineering Education Research Center at Purdue University (MEERCat Purdue), with a goal of transitioning engineering education research advances into practice at scale. Other faculty engaged in innovation and research can use this case study to identify strategies to collect data and use the results to inform both the innovation itself and the broader departmental system (i.e., policies and practices) in which it operates. By systematically looking at the larger implications of their local innovation, faculty can create productive research-to-practice cycles that can improve the teaching practice and departmental culture and later inform policy decisions at the department and college level. Two signature initiatives under the MEERCat umbrella provide useful examples of such data collection and research strategies and connections to inform research-to-practice. In one research project, faculty in the School of Mechanical Engineering transformed the core undergraduate Dynamics course into an Active, Blended, and Collaborative (ABC) learning environment, now known as ""Freeform"". As the Dynamics course was taught in an iteratively-refined Freeform learning environment, the rate at which students received the non-passing D, F, and W grades decreased. The Revolutionizing Engineering Departments (RED) project is another faculty-led research effort, which evaluates the cultural factors that influence student academic and professional outcomes and engages faculty, staff, and students in conversations that span the pedagogical-to-departmental policy spectrum. The approaches adopted in the Freeform and RED projects are detailed in this paper, with a special emphasis on data collection, research, and specific partnerships that enable department-level policy and practice discussions to take place. MEERCat's mission is to put results from the research studies into large-scale practice. The center allows the Freeform and RED projects to work in parallel to align data collection and implementation efforts and to leverage the network of other researchers and professionals on our campus, including our Institutional Research Office and Center for Instructional Excellence. since its establishment, MEERCat has received visibility across the University and has demonstrated the potential to inform practice both in the School of Mechanical Engineering and across other Schools in the College of Engineering. This paper describes the process of how a faculty-driven pedagogical innovation and research around departmental culture laid the foundation for a University-level research center that has begun to show the potential to inform teaching and learning in the School of Mechanical Engineering.",Kandakatla R.; Goldenstein A.; Evenhouse D.; Berger E.; Rhoads J.; De Boer J.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2018-06-23,College of Engineering,

R&D and non-R&D in the innovation process among firms in ASEAN countries: Based on firm-level survey data,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify factors promoting innovation in the framework of R&D based on surveys conducted on firms in five ASEAN countries, Indonesia, Laos, Thailand, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Design/methodology/approach: The analytical method divided sample firms into two categories, namely, “the R&D group” and “non-R&D group.” The analysis attempts to identify which of the internal capabilities, consisting of technology, human factors and organization factors, promote innovation. Ordered probit analysis is employed. Findings: Findings from the estimations indicate that the two groups pursue product innovation differently. The R&D group promotes innovation by cross-functional teams of production, engineering, and marketing and IT use, whereas the non-R&D group promote product innovation by HRD programs for workers, group awards for suggestions or QC, and ISO9000 series. Research limitations/implications: The number of samples related to the non-R&D group is too small to conduct statistical analysis. External linkages played an important role in the authors’ previous studies. The introduction of external linkages into the model may yield different results, though the analysis would become more complex. Practical implications: The results of this paper provide the solid basis of policy to promote innovation and upgrading SMEs in the region. Social implications: Many ASEAN SMEs successfully achieve innovation without owning specified in-house departments or sections to conduct R&D. Originality/value: The features of this paper lie in the original firm-level survey data and rigorous estimation method using ordered probit analysis, which are new to this literature.",Tsuji M.; Ueki Y.; Shigeno H.; Idota H.; Bunno T.,Journal,European Journal of Management and Business Economics,2018-06-15,Faculty of Business Administration;Kindai University;Kobe International University;Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia,Cross-functional team ;  HRD ;  Learning process ;  MNCs ;  Ordered probit analysis ;  QC
Nano-engineering of construction materials using molecular dynamics simulations: Prospects and challenges,"In recent years, research articles involving molecular dynamics simulations of construction materials have grown significantly in number. The growth reflects an emerging need to understand microscopic physical and chemical processes, which are fundamental to further improve the macroscopic performance of construction materials.

Addressing the low-altitude airspace integration challenge - USS or UTM core?,"Advancements in unmanned aerial systems (UAS) technology are invigorating the aviation industry. Integrating these platforms into low-altitude airspace globally is challenging the conventional, safety-first culture of the aviation community. Ideas ranging from segregated airspace to integrating unmanned systems alongside manned aviation within national airspace systems have emerged. This paper will examine the many challenges and approaches to ensure the world's airspace systems can maintain exceptional levels of safety while accommodating and balancing the wave of aviation advancements that will disrupt low-altitude operations in both controlled and uncontrolled airspace. Globally, air navigation service providers (ANSPs) and civil aviation authorities (CAAs) generally agree that new, commercially viable approaches must be developed to promote the use of unmanned systems while ensuring the safety of the existing airspace structure. Safety has always driven advancements in aviation and must continue to do so in the new era of unmanned platforms. UAS Traffic Management (UTM) for low-altitude airspace reinforces this need and provides a path forward for safe integration of all vehicles. The unique nature of the UAS operating environment puts UTM in the position of balancing the safety-critical responsibilities associated with low-altitude airspace management with the commercial obligations connected to interfacing with UAS operators. One model being examined in the United States today is being driven from an operator perspective, or UAS Service Suppliers (USS). The USS function delivers both mission planning for UAS operators as well as serving as distributed airspace managers through some as-yet-defined peer-to-peer coordination process. This is referred to as the operator driven model. With no single USS being the authoritative system, the current concept relies on USS to USS communication and collaboration to share position information and mission planning elements to reduce the risks of conflicts in the airspace. This approach, if widely accepted beyond the research and development phase, could usher in a major shift in airspace integration and management philosophy. Longer-term, this could be a shift from ANSPs being the responsible authority for low-altitude airspace and allocating it to third-party commercial providers. The concept of an operator centric airspace management model is a major technological and philosophical shift from today's aviation industry approach and deserves close examination and consideration. An alternative approach proposed in this paper introduces the concept of a UTM Core platform to alleviate these challenges by allocating the safety-critical, airspace management functions from the collection of USSs to a centralized function. The UTM Core concept will reduce the need for excessive coordination and provide a centralized source for information exchange among all relevant stakeholders. It will address the challenges brought on by inter-USS communication and the collaborative structure the USS centric approach is built upon. As a result, the UTM Core will promote the innovation of new USS entrants by providing the airspace domain expertise required for maintaining the safety of the existing airspace structure. The UTM Core represents an intermediate approach in the progression of an emerging industry. It seeks to build off of the positive progress made towards large-scale UAS integration and introduce new solutions to the challenges it currently faces. This approach retains the possibility of competition for service provision, if desired, and the application of advanced automation to enable a dynamic and economically efficient solution. The UTM Core presents a reasonable path forward that should be considered to maintain the outstanding levels of safety that the aviation community enjoys and expects today.",Matus F.; Hedblom B.,Conference Proceeding,"ICNS 2018 - Integrated Communications, Navigation, Surveillance Conference",2018-06-13,Thales Group,

"Engineering and development in Brazil, challenges and prospects: a new perspective on the topic","Purpose: Engineering is a powerful instrument for promoting the social and economic development of nations. Its enhancement is a strategic element to accelerate Brazil’s progress. This paper aims to present a new perspective on the topic of “Engineering and Development in Brazil, Challenges and Prospects” (Guimarães et al., 2007). Its goal is to discuss the need for restructuring the Brazilian system for research, development and innovation (RD&I) and the training of human resources in engineering in the country. Design/methodology/approach: This article is designed to discuss the relations between the performance of the industrial sector and the maturation of engineering in Brazil by looking at the national scientific production in the area in comparison to the world production and to countries (South Korea and The Netherlands). Finally, in terms of training human resources, the Brazilian study abroad program Science without Borders program is discussed in the article as an important tool for the qualification of engineering students in Brazil. Findings: A few of the main findings in this research are as follows: despite being among the top 20 countries in scientific production in Engineering, Brazil still lacks turning this scientific-technological knowledge into products and patents; Brazilian universities and research institutes must build interorganizational collaborations with the industrial sector to increase innovation in the field of engineering; The distribution of the investment in RD&I in engineering must be strategically distributed among its various fields, taking into account national strategies and the technological interrelations between them. The article concludes that engineering is a powerful instrument for promoting a country’s social development while offering indications about Brazilian strategic orientation in the development of engineering. Originality/value: Despite already being well known that engineering is a powerful instrument for promoting a country’s social development, this article innovates by associating academic scientific production in engineering to other variables related to economic development, such as gross domestic product, human development index, industrial and manufactured production and the filing of patents. It comes at an important moment when the Brazilian Government is discussing new strategies to increase social and economic development in the country while controlling for the investment in RD&I. Therefore, it is the right moment to discuss national policies in science, technology and innovation, especially in the area of engineering.",Grochocki L.; Guimarães J.; Prata A.; Oliveira J.,Journal,Innovation and Management Review,2018-06-06,Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina;Stanford University;Universidade de São Paulo;Embrapii-Brazilian Association for Industrial Research and Innovation,Brazil ;  Engineering ;  Industrial development ;  Productive systems ;  Socioeconomic development
"Collective Intelligence Education, Enhancing the Collaborative Learning","Education continually maintains challenges evidenced by an evolution since its origins. The process of learning in education must be conceived in a decentralized and collaboration context of day-to-day, in addition, the rapid and deep technological transformation carried out at the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century, especially in the Information and Communications Technologies (ICT), confronts universities with greater pressure to demonstrate the effectiveness of their educational efforts and improvement of the teachinglearning environment. Collective intelligence (CI) is an emerging field that already has a significant impact in many areas and it will have great implications for education, not only from the side of new methodologies but also as a challenge for education, which is currently more focused on the individual that in the collective. This article proposes a model of Collective Intelligence Education with ICT, combining two strategies: the management of ideas and assessment in real time, in class. A collaborative platform called FABRICIUS has been created; it supports these two elements to encourage collaboration, empowerment and student engagement in the learning process.

Back to the future of women in technology: insights from understanding the shortage of women in innovation sectors for managing corporate foresight,"This paper investigates why there is a shortage of women in innovation, such as science, particularly technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) sectors and offers insights for managing corporate foresight. It acknowledges that traditional corporate foresight methodologies have their own inherent problems, but argues that greater inclusion of women brings in new dimensions not previously recognised within the predominantly male-dominated technology sector. While extant feminist research may look at the general disadvantages women have in the workplace, few have examined the genesis and constitution of femininity to understand what new input can be brought innovation management, and how these different views can change the conduct of corporate foresight in the technology sector. Interviews from five senior personnel in the technology sector were conducted, and responses to a concise questionnaire involving 365 participants were obtained. Three case-rich narratives are presented as a summary on the future of women in technology.",Chau V.; Quire C.,Journal,Technology Analysis and Strategic Management,2018-06-03,Kent Business School,Corporate foresight ;  innovation management ;  technology management ;  women in management
Hackathons in software engineering education: Lessons learned from a decade of events,"Hackathons are currently a hot topic in industrial learning settings. Like intensive collaborative courses (e.g. code camps), hackathons have been shown to be successful tools for learning. However, current research has failed to adequately compare the two approaches with respect to who benefits, which stakeholders are involved, and what the practical arrangement differences are. We used a literature review, our own multi-year learning experiences, and written and interview material from students and industry participants to present an overview of hackathons and code camps. Based on the results of our analysis, we present a taxonomy, based on our experiences, to help practitioners decide which kind of intensive event approach is suitable for them, depending on their industry and educational needs. This synthesis and the study results provide the first steps towards a functional definition that covers intensive collaborative working events involving real-life problems, such as code camps, hackathons, and 24-hour innovation workshops. Currently, the terminology is diverse, but there are commonalities and differences across each of these events and their purposes.",Porras J.; Khakurel J.; Ikonen J.; Happonen A.; Knutas A.; Herala A.; Drögehorn O.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering,2018-06-02,"Lero - The Irish Software Engineering Research Centre;LUT University;Hochschule Harz, Hochschule für angewandte Wissenschaften (FH)",Code camp ;  Hackathon ;  Industry collaboration ;  Learning ;  Outcomes ;  Software engineering ;  Stakeholder perspectives
Subsidiary Innovation in a Developing Economy: Towards a Comprehensive Model and Directions for Future Research,"With the internationalization of innovation, multinational enterprise (MNE) subsidiaries have been found to play a critical role in product and process innovation. Deriving from a rich and diverse subsidiary innovation (SI) literature, this article attempts to develop a comprehensive model to study the factors that impact SI in a developing economy by devising three macro constructs, namely, (a) local environment (LE), (b) subsidiary traits (ST) and (c) headquarters (HQ) strategy (HS). The 15 factors associated with these macro constructs identified through literature review are statistically validated through an ‘Idea Engineering’ exercise for their contextual relevance. Based on an expert survey carried out in the developing economy context of India, barring 2 HS factors, rest of them have been found to be statistically significant in the Indian context. Antecedents of SI, identified by this article, can be used by domain practitioners and experts in the field to improve their organization’s innovative capability. The proposed model in this study can be further empirically validated by researchers working in the area of SI.",Betaraya D.; Nasim S.; Mukhopadhyay J.,Journal,FIIB Business Review,2018-06-01,Intel Technology India Pvt Ltd.;Aligarh Muslim University;ThinkCorp Consultancy Services,competitive advantage ;  headquarters strategy ;  local environment ;  multinational enterprise ;  subsidiary innovation
Aperiodic tidal data resource assessment and LCOE analysis of selected areas in Nigeria,"Renewable energy is plentiful; we need only develop the technology to harness and distribute it efficiently and economically. The conversion of energy to electricity continues to be an area of interest for engineers and researchers. Tidal energy has been classified as one of five energy innovations that could transform our world—the others being fuel cells, lithium–air batteries, the smart grid, and space-based solar power (http://oilprice.com/Alternative-Energy/Renewable-Energy/5-Clean-Energy-Innovations-That-Could-Transform-Our-World.html). Resource engineering assessment constitutes the first step to the effective utilization of any resource. There are various candidate sites for tidal stream energy in Nigeria. The objective of this research is to examine the tidal stream resource potential of seven coastal sites using the modified continuous wavelet transform (CWT) method with a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) analysis. Foster’s method is newly applied to the aperiodic tidal series data. The results indicate that meaningful power is viable and could be economically extracted at each respective site, with peak mean approximate velocities at each site of ~10 m/s, and the LCOE estimate was found to be lower than that of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

Choice of leading industry of agro-product processing in Hebei Province based on improved industrial linkage analysis,"In order to guide the agricultural product processing industry in Hebei Province specifically in the high-quality and fast development track, we analyze the applicable conditions of the Deng's grey incidence model based on the Chinese scholar Deng Julong's grey system theory. When studying the correlation of behavior index sequence whose data order can be changed, we put forward the improved method by using interval value quantization algorithm instead of initial value or average value quantization algorithm, and using the data 1 and 0 instead of the absolute difference between maximum and minimum value. This can not only solve the problem of different results due to the change of starting point data sequence and reference sequence, but can also solve the problem of destroying the intrinsic relationship of data by dimensionless processing. In order to reflect the certain sector's impact on national economy and based on the input-output theory, this paper builds the forward and backward virtual optimal reference sequence and studies the correlation effect among this sector and others. The data come from the input-output tables of 139 sectors of Hebei Province in 2012 and other agricultural product processing industry statistical data from 2013 to 2016. According to the national economy industry classification standard and research needs, based on Hirschman industry relevancy criteria, Rostow industrial diffusion effect criteria and Ricardo's comparative advantage criteria, 17 categories of agricultural processing sectors are selected as the research objects, and 8 evaluation indices have been determined, including influence coefficient, response coefficient, main business income ratio, proportion of exports and domestic selling outside the province, economic benefit coefficient, economic growth rate, economic technology coefficient and the structure of the labor input coefficient. The high correlation coefficients such as economic benefit coefficient, economic technology coefficient and the structure of the labor input coefficient are processed based on the improved grey correlation analysis method and calculation of 8 categories of correlation indices. Then the optimization analysis on the influence coefficient and response coefficient is performed. Finally, 6 evaluation indices are determined to evaluate the 17 categories of agricultural processing sectors comprehensively. The results show that the comprehensive evaluation of the fur feather silk industry is the best, with main business income at the 1st place, and the total of exports and domestic selling outside Hebei Province at the 2nd place. The economic benefit coefficient, response coefficient and economic growth rate of this industry are all in the top 5. The comprehensive evaluation of cotton and jute products industry is at the 2nd place. Same as fur feather silk industry, it becomes the key part of business main income and export products of agricultural processing in Hebei Province. The Chinese medicine processing industry ranks the 4th with excellent economic growth rate and economic benefit. This result meets the strategic deployment of revitalizing the traditional Chinese medicine career and developing the Chinese medicine characteristic industry. The comprehensive evaluation of dairy products industry is at the 5th place with response coefficient, export or outflow outside province domestically and economic growth rate at the 5th, 6th and 2nd place respectively. This industry develops well. The comprehensive evaluation of grain and plant oil processing industry ranks the 6th and 7th respectively, which indicates large capacity of grain and oil production in Hebei Province. It has a good effect on the national economy and increases the income of main business. The fruits and vegetables processing industry ranks the 8th with 9.4% of the average annual main business revenue growth, which reflects the obvious effect on agriculture transformation and upgrading in Hebei Province as the second largest vegetable production province in China. The comprehensive evaluation of rubber manufacturing industry ranks the 9th with economic benefit, growth rate and main business income all at the 6th or 7th. It is concluded that the 5 edible agricultural processing industries and 3 traditional processing industries have high competitive advantages and should be supported as the leading industries. Although the comprehensive evaluation of the sugar industry is better, it is too small to be the leading industry.

Researches of fracture evolution induced by soft rock protective seam mining and an omni-directional stereo pressure-relief gas extraction technical system: a case study,"In the absence of a suitable coal seam to serve as the protective seam in deep mining, an innovative solution of using the soft rock seam as the protective seam mining has been put forward. Taking the Luling Coal Mine as the engineering background, theoretical analysis and similar simulation experiment were conducted to study the key technologies used in soft rock protective seam (SRPS) mining. This included the characteristics of the pressure-relief gas source and accumulation zone, and the pressure-relief gas extraction of the protected seam. The results show that after mining the SRPS, the pressure-relief gas rushing out of nearby coal seams has become the major gas source in SRPS mining. An omni-directional stereo pressure-relief gas extraction system was developed, which consisted of techniques such as buried pipes in the goaf, ground extraction wells, intercepting boreholes, and seam-crossing boreholes. During the investigation, the total pressure-relief gas extraction flow amounted to 29.5 m3/min, and the gas pre-extraction rate reached 66.6% for the overlying protected seams (seams 8 and 9). The investigation into the protective effects in the cut hole showed that the maximal gas pressure and content were 0.35 MPa and 4.87 m3/t, respectively. This indicated that drilling extraction boreholes in the gas accumulation zone played a key role in obtaining an improved pressure-relief gas extraction effect. Further, these findings suggested that SRPS mining (in combination with omni-directional stereo pressure-relief gas extraction technology) could turn dangerous coal seams into ones with much less gas content, and hence free from gas outburst.",Cheng X.; Zhao G.; Li Y.; Meng X.; Dong C.; Liu Z.,Journal,Arabian Journal of Geosciences,2018-06-01,Anhui University of Science and Technology,Coal and gas outburst ;  Gas extraction ;  Mining-induced fracture ;  Pressure-relief ;  Soft rock protective seam
Negative emissions - Part 3: Innovation and upscaling,"We assess the literature on innovation and upscaling for negative emissions technologies (NETs) using a systematic and reproducible literature coding procedure. To structure our review, we employ the framework of sequential stages in the innovation process, with which we code each NETs article in innovation space. We find that while there is a growing body of innovation literature on NETs, 59% of the articles are focused on the earliest stages of the innovation process, 'research and development' (R&D). The subsequent stages of innovation are also represented in the literature, but at much lower levels of activity than R&D. Distinguishing between innovation stages that are related to the supply of the technology (R&D, demonstrations, scale up) and demand for the technology (demand pull, niche markets, public acceptance), we find an overwhelming emphasis (83%) on the supply side. BECCS articles have an above average share of demand-side articles while direct air carbon capture and storage has a very low share. Innovation in NETs has much to learn from successfully diffused technologies; appealing to heterogeneous users, managing policy risk, as well as understanding and addressing public concerns are all crucial yet not well represented in the extant literature. Results from integrated assessment models show that while NETs play a key role in the second half of the 21st century for 1.5 °C and 2 °C scenarios, the major period of new NETs deployment is between 2030 and 2050. Given that the broader innovation literature consistently finds long time periods involved in scaling up and deploying novel technologies, there is an urgency to developing NETs that is largely unappreciated. This challenge is exacerbated by the thousands to millions of actors that potentially need to adopt these technologies for them to achieve planetary scale. This urgency is reflected neither in the Paris Agreement nor in most of the literature we review here. If NETs are to be deployed at the levels required to meet 1.5 °C and 2 °C targets, then important post-R&D issues will need to be addressed in the literature, including incentives for early deployment, niche markets, scale-up, demand, and - particularly if deployment is to be hastened - public acceptance.",Nemet G.; Callaghan M.; Creutzig F.; Fuss S.; Hartmann J.; Hilaire J.; Lamb W.; Minx J.; Rogers S.; Smith P.,Journal,Environmental Research Letters,2018-06-01,Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change;University of Wisconsin-Madison;Universität Hamburg;Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung;University of Aberdeen;University of Leeds;Technische Universität Berlin,carbon removal ;  geo-engineering ;  negative emissions ;  Paris agreement

Modern ironworks are characterized by their complicated industrial structure oriented to the engineering support of the complete manufacturing cycle. Apart from the introduction of innovations at the ironworks, new facilities are actively put into operation. During the performed research, it was revealed that the typical feature of the modern metallurgy in Russia was the decrease in the energy intensity of production.

"A ""dynamic form-finding"" approach to environmental-performance building design","Newly-designed high-rise buildings, both in China and abroad, have demonstrated new innovations from the creative concept to the creative method. from the creative concept to the creative method. At the same time, digital technology has enabled more design freedom in the vertical dimension. ""Twisting"" has gradually become the morphological choice of many city landmark buildings in recent years. The form seems more likely to be driven by the interaction of aesthetics and structural engineering. Environmental performance is often a secondary consideration; it is typically not simulated until the evaluation phase. Based on the research results of ""DigitalFUTURE Shanghai 2017 Workshop - Wind Tunnel Visualization"", an approach that can be employed by architects to design environmental-performance buildings during the early stages has been explored. The integration of a dynamic form-finding approach (DFFA) and programming transforms the complex relationship between architecture and environment into a dialogue of computer language and dynamic models. It allows the design to focus on the relationship between morphology and the surrounding environment, and is not limited to the envelope form itself. This new concept of DFFA in this research consists of three elements: 1) architectural form; 2) integration of wind tunnel and dynamic models; and 3) environmental response. The concept of wind tunnel testing integrated with a dynamic model fundamentally abandons the functional definition of the traditional static environment simulation analysis. Instead it is driven by integral environmental performance as the basic starting point of morphological generation.",Yao J.; Lin Y.; Zheng J.; Yuan P.,Journal,International Journal of High-Rise Buildings,2018-06-01,Tongji University,Dynamic models ;  Form-finding ;  Twisting building design ;  Wind environment ;  Wind tunnel
An EU without the UK: mapping the UK’s changing roles in the EU scientific research,"In science, technology and innovation, the consequences of Britain’s exit (Brexit) for both Britain and the Europe Union (EU) are still uncertain. However, there is no doubt that in the years to come, the UK will need to re-calibrate its scientific collaborations with other EU countries. In this research, we aim to identify which EU countries would suffer the greatest loss and which research fields would be most affected by Brexit. Based on the scientific output of each EU country, as indexed by the Web of Science, we demonstrate that international scientific collaboration frequently involves the UK. We also define four types of roles according to the UK’s performance in production and collaboration; these roles are of great significance to our understanding of the status of the UK in the EU. In this sense, the UK acted as a leader in health sciences, a pioneer in social sciences, an assistant in physical sciences, and a participant in engineering.",Hu Z.; Lin G.; Sun T.; Wang X.,Journal,Scientometrics,2018-06-01,Dalian University of Technology,Brexit ;  European Union ;  Scientific collaboration ;  United Kingdom
A matter-element method for risk identification of technology innovation,"With the rapid development of IT, technology innovation has attracted increasing attentions from governments, enterprises and researchers. It is notable that the failure rate of technology innovation is high and the risk cannot be ignored. Risk identification is a critical step of risk management and to identify risk accurately and effectively is important for technology innovation organizations. However, the extant risk identification approaches cannot be directly applied, due to the characteristics of technology innovation risk such as uncertainty and fuzziness. In this paper we introduce matter-element model, which is developed from extension theory, and can be employed to support the characteristics of technology innovation risk. On the basis of the traditional meta-model, this paper attempts to improve the schema, through constructing indicator system of technology innovation risk. We present a method of determining the weights of indicators based on minimum deviation, which integrates the AHP weight and entropy weight. Through the calculating process and sensitivity analysis, the risk factors of technology innovation with different features can be identified, and technology innovation organizations can formulate and perform targeted strategies toward different risk factors. Finally, based on an instance, we discuss the effectiveness of our method and draw the conclusions.",Xiao Q.,Journal,International Journal of System Assurance Engineering and Management,2018-06-01,Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics,Matter-element model ;  Minimum deviation weight ;  Risk identification ;  Technology innovation
"U.S. energy sector impacts of technology innovation, fuel price, and electric sector CO<inf>2</inf> policy: Results from the EMF 32 model intercomparison study","We study the impact of fuel prices, technology innovation, and a CO2 emissions reduction policy on both the electric power and end-use sectors by comparing outputs from four U.S. energy-economic models through the year 2050. Achieving innovation goals decreases CO2 emissions in all models, regardless of natural gas price, due to increased energy efficiency and low-carbon generation becoming more cost competitive. For the models that include domestic natural gas markets, achieving innovation goals lowers wholesale electricity prices, but this effect diminishes as projected natural gas prices increase. Higher natural gas prices lead to higher wholesale electricity prices but fewer coal capacity retirements. A CO2 electric power sector emissions cap influences electric sector evolution under reference technology assumptions but has little to no incremental influence when added to innovation goals. Long-term, meeting innovation goals achieves a generation mix with similar CO2 emissions compared to the CO2 policy but with smaller increases to wholesale electricity prices. In the short-term, the relative effect on wholesale prices differs by model. Finally, higher natural gas prices, achieving innovation goals, and the combination of the two, increases the amount of renewable generation that is cost-effective to build and operate while slowing the growth of natural-gas fired generation, which is the predominant generation type in 2050 under reference conditions.",Hodson E.; Brown M.; Cohen S.; Showalter S.; Wise M.; Wood F.; Caron J.; Feijoo F.; Iyer G.; Cleary K.,Journal,Energy Economics,2018-06-01,"National Renewable Energy Laboratory;United States Department of Energy;Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso;Pacific Northwest National Laboratory;HEC Montréal;OnLocation, Inc.",CO  policy 2 ;  Electric power sector ;  Energy modeling forum ;  Greenhouse gas emissions ;  Technology innovation ;  Wholesale electricity prices

Computational model of enterprise cooperative technology innovation risk based on nerve network,"Collaborative innovation has become the principal innovation method because of the puniness of the innovation strength of the enterprises. Due to the objective reality nature of the risk of enterprise collaborative technology innovation, it is necessary to take measures to prevent and indemnify the loss which the risk may bring. Because there is the complex nonlinear function mechanism between risk factors, the cooperative mode and control mechanism of enterprise collaborative innovation can be studied by nonlinear method. First, this paper analyzed the seeking method of enterprise collaborative innovation risk, and then the concept of controlling risk regulation gradient of the cooperating technological innovation under network environment was explained. And a complete controlling risk model of the cooperating technological innovation has been put forward, which is based on the wavelet and nerve network.

Creating a culture for radical innovation in a small mature business,"This article describes an approach in organizational development to develop an innovation culture for radical product development in a small mature engineering company. The research took place in a business based in the United Kingdom that designed and manufactured instrumentation and specialized packing machines. An initial study within the company’s new product development team identified key aspects that influenced a radical innovation culture. Nine key themes were found to be pertinent, following an iterative process with the development team. These themes were triangulated using the established Organization Culture Assessment Instrument and the Creative Climate Assessment Tool. A third assessment was developed that gauged the development team culture proximity to an ideal position. Seven interventions were developed in conjunction with the company development team, senior managers, the analysis of previous empirical case research and dialogue with UK companies that promote discontinuous innovation. The results of the interventions were evaluated 4 years after implementation. The culture was re-assessed using the same assessment tools and the changes were identified. The outcomes are described and they indicate the success of the company’s attempt to embed a sustainable radical innovation culture into the product development area.",McLaughlin P.,Journal,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture",2018-06-01,Cranfield University,ambidexterity ;  ambidextrous organization ;  culture change ;  New product development ;  radical innovation culture
Making an impact: The effects of game making on creativity and spatial processing,"For decades, researchers have tried to understand how to guide students to both pursue and excel in a career in the fields science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Recently, creativity has been recognized as being important in STEM-based fields and some researchers have even suggested a shift from STEM to STEAM to account for the artistic side of science (Boy, 2013; Henriksen, 2014). Creative capacities augment scientific endeavors given the role these capacities play in problem-solving and innovation. Our work focuses on identifying a method to improve both creativity and spatial abilities, as spatial ability predicts the likelihood to succeed in a STEM field (Wai et al., 2009). Some scientists found that making computer games provides students with an introduction to computer science and technology through an engaging, self-driven platform. While this technique has been successful in sparking interest in STEM careers (Javidi & Sheybani, 2010; Robertson & Howells, 2008), little research has been conducted on how it impacts STEM success. We examined if game-making could lead to cognitive improvement in creativity and spatial abilities in addition to its attitudinal effects. Using a longitudinal, pretest/post-test design, we found that making levels in Portal 2 improved creative and spatial abilities over a control. Participants who made levels also reported being more interested and confident in a variety of STEM-related activities. We conclude that game-making can be used as an engaging way to not only encourage students to pursue, but prepare them to succeed in STEM careers.",Gallagher D.; Grimm L.,Journal,Thinking Skills and Creativity,2018-06-01,The College of New Jersey,
3D-printed scaffolds with bioactive elements-induced photothermal effect for bone tumor therapy,"For treatment of bone tumor and regeneration of bone defects, the biomaterials should possess the ability to kill tumor cells and regenerate bone defect simultaneously. To date, there are a few biomaterials possessing such dual functions, the disadvantages, however, such as long-term toxicity and degradation, restrict their application. Although bioactive elements have been incorporated into biomaterials to improve their osteogenic activity, there is no report about elements-induced functional scaffolds for photothermal tumor therapy. Herein, the elements (Cu, Fe, Mn, Co)-doped bioactive glass-ceramic (BGC) scaffolds with photothermal effect and osteogenic differentiation ability were prepared via 3D-printing method. Moreover, the photothermal anti-tumor effect and osteogenic activity of these scaffolds were systematically investigated. The prepared elements-doped scaffolds possessed excellent photothermal performance, which displayed a trend, 5Cu-BGC > 5Fe-BGC > 5Mn-BGC > 5Co-BGC, in this study. The final temperature of elements-doped scaffolds can be well controlled by altering the doping element categories, contents and laser power density. Additionally, the hyperthermia induced by 5Cu-BGC, 5Fe-BGC and 5Mn-BGC effectively killed tumor cells in vitro and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. More importantly, 5Fe-BGC and 5Mn-BGC scaffolds could promote rabbit bone mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs) adhesion, and the ionic products released from elements-doped scaffolds significantly stimulated the osteogenic differentiation of bone-forming cells. These results suggested that 5Fe-BGC and 5Mn-BGC scaffolds possessed promising potential for photothermal treatment of bone tumor and at the same time for stimulating bone regeneration, representing a smart strategy for the treatment of bone tumors by combining dual functional bioactive ions with tissue engineering scaffolds. Statement of Significance: The major innovation of this study is that we fabricated the elements (Cu, Fe, Mn, Co)-doped bioactive scaffolds via 3D printing technique and found that they possess distinct photothermal performance and osteogenic differentiation ability. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report about elements-doped scaffolds for photothermal therapy of bone tumor. This is an important research advance by combining the photothermal effect and osteogenic differentiation activity of bioactive elements in the scaffold system for potential bone tumor therapy and bone reconstruction. We optimized the elements-doped scaffolds and found the photothermal effect of elements-doped scaffolds (5Cu-BGC, 5Fe-BGC, 5Mn-BGC) could effectively kill tumor cells in vivo. The photothermal performance of elements-doped scaffolds follows a trend: 5Cu-BGC > 5Fe-BGC > 5Mn-BGC > 5Co-BGC > BGC. Compared to traditional nano-sized photothermal agents, bioactive elements-induced functional scaffolds have better biosecurity and bioactivity. Furthermore, 5Fe-BGC and 5Mn-BGC scaffolds displayed excellent bone-forming activity by stimulating the osteogenic differentiation of bone-forming cells. The major significance of the study is that the elements-doped bioactive glass-ceramics (5Fe-BGC, 5Mn-BGC) have great potential to be used as bifunctional scaffolds for photothermal tumor therapy and bone regeneration, representing a smart strategy for the treatment of bone tumors by combining dual functional bioactive ions with tissue engineering scaffolds.",Liu Y.; Li T.; Ma H.; Zhai D.; Deng C.; Wang J.; Zhuo S.; Chang J.; Wu C.,Journal,Acta Biomaterialia,2018-06-01,"Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences",3D-printed scaffolds ;  Bioactive glass-ceramic ;  Osteogenic differentiation ;  Photothermal therapy ;  Transition metal elements
"Academia or enterprises: gender, research outputs, and employment among PhD graduates in China","PhD graduates play an important role in the national innovation system. However, only a few studies have explored Chinese PhD graduates’ employment and development prospects because of limited data. To fill in this gap, this study conducted a survey of doctoral recipients in 13 Chinese universities. The authors drew on the national survey data and in-depth interviews to critically analyze the PhD graduates’ job preferences, employment outcomes, and factors that affect their employment sectors. Results indicate a notable difference between the graduates’ job preferences and their employment outcomes. The proportion of employment in academia is substantially below expected, particularly among female graduates. This study specifically focuses on the impact of gender and scientific output (including articles and patents) on the employment outcomes of PhD graduates. Compared with graduates employed by the non-academic sectors, male graduates have a lower probability of employment in universities and research institutions. Compared with those working in enterprises, PhD graduates employed in universities and research institutions published more during their doctoral study. For graduates who majored in science, engineering, and agricultural sciences, having patents increases their probability of working in the enterprises.",Wenqin S.; Yao G.; Bin Z.; Jin J.,Journal,Asia Pacific Education Review,2018-06-01,"Peking University;Lingnan University, Hong Kong;Shaanxi Normal University",Employment ;  Gender ;  Graduation survey ;  Job preference ;  PhD graduates
Competition between academic journals for scholars’ attention: the ‘Nature effect’ in scholarly communication,"Here, we study readers’ choice in a context in which scholar’s attention is drawn to salient attributes of academic papers such as importance or accessibility. An article’s attribute is salient when it stands out among the paper’s attributes relative to that attribute’s average level in the choice set. In our model, scholars may attach disproportionately high consideration to salient attributes of academic articles. This paper shows that, depending on the writing complexity in determining article importance, scientific communication in some research fields exhibits accessibility–salient equilibria in which scholars are most attentive to accessibility and less sensitive to article importance. Generalist disciplines (the social and human sciences) with an abundance of multidisciplinary journals which publish research in several fields can be described in this way. In other academic disciplines, scholars are attentive to article importance and are to some extent insensitive to differences in accessibility. There, journals compete on article importance, which can be over-supplied relative to the efficient level of a scholarly paper. One academic discipline with an abundance of highly-specific journals within a sub-field of physics/mathematics/engineering can be described by such equilibria. We also explore the possibility of radical change in scholarly communication when the use of writing complexity in determining article importance changes drastically, whereby a journal acquires access to a revolutionary system of determining articles whose importance is at a much lower writing complexity that its competitor journal. There, when the marginal complexity in determining importance is low, a large improvement in importance entails only a small decrease in accessibility. This allows the academic journal to set a salient high article importance and to win the scholars’ attention, which is named as the ‘Nature effect’.",García J.; Rodriguez-Sánchez R.; Fdez-Valdivia J.,Journal,Scientometrics,2018-06-01,Universidad de Granada,Article importance ;  Innovation ;  Nature ;  Paper accessibility ;  Salience ;  Scholar’s attention ;  Scientific communication ;  Writing complexity
Building information modeling for energy retrofitting – A review,"Building Information Modeling (BIM), as a rising technology in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry, has been applied to various research topics from project planning, structural design, facility management, among others. Furthermore, with the increasing demand for energy efficiency, the AEC industry requires an expeditious energy retrofit of the existing building stock to successfully achieve the 2020 Energy Strategy targets. As such, this article seeks to survey the recent developments in the energy efficiency of buildings, combining energy retrofitting and the technological capabilities of BIM, providing a critical exposition in both engineering and energy domains. The result is a thorough review of the work done by other authors in relevant fields, comprising the entire spectrum from on-site data acquisition, through the generation of Building Energy Models (BEM), data transfer to energy analysis software and, finally, the identification of major issues throughout this process. Additionally, a BIM-based methodology centered on the acquired knowledge is presented. Solutions for as-built data acquisition such as laser scanning and infrared thermography, and on-site energy tests that benefit the acquisition of energy-related data are explored. The most predominant BIM software regarding not only energy analysis but also model development is examined. In addition, interoperability restrictions between BIM and energy analysis software are addressed using the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and Green Building Extensible Markup Language (gbXML) schemes. Lastly, the article argues the future innovations in this subject, predicting future trends and challenges for the industry.",Sanhudo L.; Ramos N.; Poças Martins J.; Almeida R.; Barreira E.; Simões M.; Cardoso V.,Journal,Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,2018-06-01,Instituto Politécnico de Viseu;Universidade do Porto,Authoring and energy analysis software ;  Building information modeling ;  Data acquisition methods ;  Energy retrofit ;  Interoperability
When neighboring disciplines fail to learn from each other: The case of innovation and project management research,"As knowledge production becomes more specialized, studying complex and multi-faceted empirical realities becomes more difficult. This has created a growing need for cross-fertilization and collaboration between research disciplines. According to prior studies, the sharing of concepts, ideas and empirical domains with other disciplines may promote cross-fertilization. We challenge this one-sided view. Based on an analysis of the parallel development of the neighboring disciplines of innovation studies and project management, we show that the sharing of concepts and empirical domains can have ambivalent effects. Under conditions of ideological distancing, shared concepts and domains will be narrowly assimilated − an effect we call ‘encapsulation’ – which creates an illusion of sharing, while promoting further self-containment. By comparison, reflexive meta-theories and cross-disciplinary community-building will enable a form of sharing that promotes cross-fertilization. Our findings inform research on research specialization, cross-fertilization and effectiveness of interdisciplinary collaboration.",Davies A.; Manning S.; Söderlund J.,Journal,Research Policy,2018-06-01,University of Massachusetts Boston;University College London;Handelshøyskolen BI,Community-building ;  Encapsulation ;  Ideological distancing ;  Interdisciplinarity ;  Knowledge specialization ;  Meta-theories
Food engineering and food science and technology: Forward-looking journey to future new horizons,"The overall objectives of this study were to assess the status of Food Engineering (FE), Food Science and Technology (FS&T) and related fields using a global web-survey and included: identifying the major challenges and opportunities; and making specific recommendations for future possible paradigm shifts. Respondents from academia, private research institutes, industry, government, consulting and others sectors participated. The most important topics selected were: ‘Innovation/open innovation,’ ‘Broad education and multidisciplinary capabilities,’ ‘Career development & prospects,’ and ‘Applied research.’ Lowest importance were ‘Basic science’ and ‘Salary.’ Highest possible impact on FE and FS&T future curricula were: ‘Food safety, waste reduction/management’ and ‘Environmental impact, food sustainability and security.’ Overwhelming majority (>68%) indicated that FE or FS&T should be integrated with other existing/evolving academic program. Principal component analysis yielded 3-new variables, offering insights on the relationships between geographical education location and sustainability, innovation and employability. The competitive landscape calls for reshaping of the domains vision. Industrial relevance: • Basic research and salary were selected by the respondents to have a very low importance. Enhancing applied research, agility, attractiveness of the field and strengthen research relevance and collaboration with industry are required.• Both government/state and food industry financial support is a clear indication of the significant role they play in the innovation ecosystem collaboration.• Significant difference between North America & Canada and Europe on addressing innovation, soft skills and employability offer new insights on enhancing utilization of innovation, science, technology and impact.• Innovation and open innovation offer FE and FS&T unique new horizons for spearheading change and opportunities to alleviate typical industrial and academic conservativeness and risk aversion.",Saguy I.; Roos Y.; Cohen E.,Journal,Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies,2018-06-01,UniSA Business;Ben-Gurion University of the Negev;University College Cork;Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"New curricula ;  Open and disruptive innovation ;  Paradigm shifts ;  Principal component analysis ;  Strategy, vision and missions"
Product innovation rumors as forms of open innovation,"Prior studies of open innovation have highlighted the effects of different flows of knowledge between firms and external partners—such as flows of software code, technical solutions, or new product ideas—and how firms face a “paradox of openness” about how open to be to external sources while also appropriating value. There are increasingly flows of more provisional knowledge as well, in the form of product innovation rumors exchanged within online technology blogs. Our study objective was to understand how product innovation rumors are used by firms as both inflows and outflows of provisional knowledge and their effect on the innovation process. Using interview data within a high-technology firm whose forthcoming products were the subject of rumor within technology blogs, we develop propositions regarding how inflows of product innovation rumors affect innovation decisions (while addressing concerns about appropriability and intrafirm knowledge flows) and how outflows from firms may affect stakeholders outside the firm (through selective revealing and influence of technology blog editors). Product innovation rumors in part address the paradox of openness by forming an informal means of open innovation alongside formal processes, and we suggest further research opportunities in this domain.",Hannigan T.; Seidel V.; Yakis-Douglas B.,Journal,Research Policy,2018-06-01,"King’s Business School;Alberta School of Business;University of Oxford, Saïd Business School;Harvard John A.

"Relationships among open innovation, innovative performance, government support and firm size: Comparing Brazilian firms embracing different levels of radicalism in innovation","This work extends knowledge concerning the relationships among open innovation, innovative performance and government support for innovation within Brazilian firms. Data were obtained from two different firm samples (Sample A, on incremental innovation, and Sample B, on radical innovation). The main research results are as follows. First, in considering government support for innovation, Sample B, based on radical innovation, played a superior and stronger role than Sample A. Secondly, for both samples, the cooperation of external firms has a positive effect on firms’ innovative performance, which was positively controlled by the size of the firms. Thirdly, in general, radical innovation requires synergy and a more intense focus regarding the constructs considered therein. This work also adds value in methodological terms, as this is the first research to have tested different models of samples with different levels of radicalism in innovation.",Jugend D.; Jabbour C.; Alves Scaliza J.; Rocha R.; Junior J.; Latan H.; Salgado M.,Journal,Technovation,2018-06-01,"Montpellier Recherche en Management (MRM);Aarhus Universitet;Universidade Estadual Paulista ""Júlio de Mesquita Filho"";STIE Bank BPD Jateng",Collaboration ;  Emerging economies ;  Innovation ;  Open innovation ;  Structural equation modeling

Pedagogical and technological replanning: a successful case study on integration and transversal skills for engineering freshmen,"Replanning is often used to optimize results of an activity in an ever changing world. To address the challenge of preparing future engineers for success, a special course was created for all engineering freshmen of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto, in Portugal. Presented as a case study, this special course underwent a careful replanning as a result of several years of experience in teaching practice alongside with a theoretical deepening in pedagogical and technological issues, under the aegis of the action-research methodology. Within the context of the case study course, the mentioned replanning was also based on a theoretical approach that clearly identifies teaching–learning-assessment methodologies that promote regulation from those that foster emancipation, using a specific instrument: a taxonomy of educational processes. The replanning was designed to globally boost results regarding the educational aims of the course such as furthering freshmen’s integration into work environment and preparing them for success by fostering transversal skills (needed for study and work). Technology is seen as a mean of education enrichment as well as a productivity tool. The introduced innovations include fun-but-educational activities, several types of assessment over time and specific technological tools which were critical for the educational impact/achievement of this course. Success is demonstrated by encouraging feedback from the stakeholders, high students’ classifications and a steady reduction in retention. It is advocated that large portions of the reasoning behind the replanning can be extrapolated to other courses.",Torres M.; Sousa A.; Torres R.,Journal,International Journal of Technology and Design Education,2018-06-01,Universidade do Porto;Manuel Firmino & Associados,Active learning ;  E-learning ;  Engineering ;  Integration ;  Pedagogical–technological innovations ;  Transversal skills
Australian enrolment trends in technology and engineering: putting the T and E back into school STEM,"There has been much political and educational focus on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) in Australian schools in recent years and while there has been significant research examining science and mathematics enrolments in senior high school, little is known about the corresponding trends in Technologies and engineering. Understanding these subjects is essential for educators and policy-makers alike if Australians are to embrace the challenges of an innovation economy. We have collected raw enrolment data from each of the Australian state and territory education departments from 1992 to 2014 and analysed this across five Technology and Engineering subject areas. We also consider some of the relationships between these subject areas and other areas of the STEM equation. The results of these analyses are discussed in terms of absolute enrolments, participation rates and sex balance. We have found that the total number of students in Year 12 increased year on year and that this growth is echoed, to a lesser extent, in the participation rates for design technology, food technology and engineering. Digital Technologies however, grew rapidly until 2000, after which time it has been in steady decline. We identify that while the trends mostly show growth, there is a concerning male bias to many of these subject areas. We suggest that the broadening of the upper high school curriculum, confusion surrounding vocational training enrolments, and gamesmanship of the university entrance system, may be contributing to the limited growth observed. Finally, we identify a number of important areas for further research in this key learning area.",Kennedy J.; Quinn F.; Lyons T.,Journal,International Journal of Technology and Design Education,2018-06-01,University of New England Australia;Queensland University of Technology,Digital technology ;  Engineering ;  Enrolment trends ;  Gender ;  High-school ;  STEM ;  Technology
Data science: A comprehensive overview,"The 21st century has ushered in the age of big data and data economy, in which data DNA, which carries important knowledge, insights, and potential, has become an intrinsic constituent of all data-based organisms. An appropriate understanding of data DNA and its organisms relies on the new field of data science and its keystone, analytics. Although it is widely debated whether big data is only hype and buzz, and data science is still in a very early phase, significant challenges and opportunities are emerging or have been inspired by the research, innovation, business, profession, and education of data science. This article provides a comprehensive survey and tutorial of the fundamental aspects of data science: the evolution from data analysis to data science, the data science concepts, a big picture of the era of data science, the major challenges and directions in data innovation, the nature of data analytics, new industrialization and service opportunities in the data economy, the profession and competency of data education, and the future of data science.

A concurrent design approach for model-based technology roadmapping,"Corporate research and technology (R&T) management needs reliable information for strategic planning. A commonly used tool are technology roadmaps, since they describe vision and corporate strategy for technology evolution. The process of creating a technology roadmap involves experts from engineering, product development and all support functions evaluating and comparing opportunities for incremental as well as disruptive innovation. This work describes an approach, where experts build and run models in a concurrent design environment allowing the evaluation of potential product architectures according to a defined set of figures of merit and at different time horizons. This mapping of the landscape can then inform the planning of technology investment and development. The process is illustrated using the example of a solar-electric aircraft technology roadmap.",Knoll D.; Golkar A.; De Weck O.,Conference Proceeding,"12th Annual IEEE International Systems Conference, SysCon 2018 - Proceedings",2018-05-30,MIT School of Engineering;Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology,Concurrent Design ;  Model Based Systems Engineering ;  Technology Evolution ;  Technology Management ;  Technology Roadmapping ;  Tradespace Exploration
Teacher's adoption and use of mobile devices outside the classroom for learning in Africa: A complementary case study of secondary school teachers in South Africa and Tanzania,"Teachers play a vital role in imparting knowledge and skills to students in secondary schools. Secondary schools in developing countries are characterised by a shortage of teaching materials which limits the provision of impactful knowledge on students. Researchers have suggested the use of a variety of technologies and approaches that teachers could employ to impart knowledge and enhance teaching practices. One such technology that is relevant in developing countries is mobile devices. Little is known about teacher's adoption and use of mobile devices outside the classroom in South Africa and Tanzania. For this research paper, the diffusion of innovation theory is used as a lens to explain teacher's adoption and use of mobile devices outside the classroom. This research discusses findings from questionnaires distributed to Form IV (Tanzania) and Grade 12 (South Africa) teachers. The findings propose that besides using mobile devices for socialization and recreational purposes, teachers also use mobile devices to search for information and other academic purposes. Teachers contact colleagues by calling, texting and sending instant messages to acquire knowledge or enquire on unclear academic issues. Teachers use cameras, videos, YouTube and maps on mobile devices to acquire or disseminate knowledge. Also, teachers observe colleagues use of mobile devices which assists during adoption. Teachers are divided on the complexity of using mobile devices for learning. The research contributes to the body of knowledge by explaining secondary school teacher's adoption and use of mobile devices outside the classroom in developing countries.",Dick Mwapwele S.; Roodt S.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 Conference on Information Communications Technology and Society, ICTAS 2018 - Proceedings",2018-05-29,University of Cape Town,complementary case study ;  education and mobile devices ;  education technology ;  ICT4D ;  informal use of mobile devices ;  Mobile learning ;  secondary school teachers in Africa ;  secondary schools ;  South Africa ;  Tanzania ;  teacher's adoption of mobile devices ;  technology-enhanced learning
Enhancing product and service capability through scaling agility in a global software vendor environment,"Agile software development has become increasingly common in software vendor organisations, and their impact on practices and roles is now extending beyond the project level across the entire organisation. In this study, we investigate how a major Australia-based multi-site global software vendor transitioned from a structured to a Scaled Agile approach. We demonstrate how practices and roles in a distributed software vendor evolved over time across the organisation in an on-going process of their global agile transformation. Through this elaboration, we identify three major agile transitions and the contribution of a scaled agile approach in the building of market driven capabilities. We theorised a relationship between increased dynamic capabilities of the firm and a scaled agile transition. Supporting our view, we noted that agile practices and roles across the organisation contributed as expected to improved internal process capability. More surprisingly, they were also found to increase our vendor's ability both to identify and take advantage of opportunities and to innovate in global product and service development and delivery.",Lal R.; Clear T.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering,2018-05-27,Auckland University of Technology,dynamic capabilities ;  global software engineering practice ;  global software engineering research ;  product and service innovation ;  scaled agile methods ;  software vendors
Interactive and automated debugging for big data analytics,"An abundance of data in many disciplines of science, engineering, national security, health care, and business has led to the emerging field of Big Data Analytics that run in a cloud computing environment. To process massive quantities of data in the cloud, developers leverage Data-Intensive Scalable Computing (DISC) systems such as Google's MapReduce, Hadoop, and Spark. Currently, developers do not have easy means to debug DISC applications. The use of cloud computing makes application development feel more like batch jobs and the nature of debugging is therefore post-mortem. Developers of big data applications write code that implements a data processing pipeline and test it on their local workstation with a small sample data, downloaded from a TB-scale data warehouse. They cross fingers and hope that the program works in the expensive production cloud. When a job fails or they get a suspicious result, data scientists spend hours guessing at the source of the error, digging through post-mortem logs. In such cases, the data scientists may want to pinpoint the root cause of errors by investigating a subset of corresponding input records. The vision of my work is to provide interactive, real-Time and automated debugging services for big data processing programs in modern DISC systems with minimum performance impact. My work investigates the following research questions in the context of big data analytics: (1) What are the necessary debugging primitives for interactive big data processing? (2) What scalable fault localization algorithms are needed to help the user to localize and characterize the root causes of errors? (3) How can we improve testing efficiency during iterative development of DISC applications by reasoning the semantics of dataflow operators and user-defined functions used inside dataflow operators in tandem? To answer these questions, we synthesize and innovate ideas from software engineering, big data systems, and program analysis, and coordinate innovations across the software stack from the user-facing API all the way down to the systems infrastructure.",Gulzar M.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering,2018-05-27,"University of California, Los Angeles",and data cleaning ;  Automated debugging ;  Big data ;  Data provenance ;  Data-intensive scalable computing (DISC) ;  Debugging and testing ;  Fault localization ;  Test minimization
Application of the SPOC instructional model supported by e-schoolbag teaching system,"The innovation of teaching mode based on information technology specially embodies deep integration of information technology and education. The emergence of massive open online courses (MOOCs) not only changes the ecology of education, but also facilitates a blended learning paradigm, known as small private online courses (SPOCs), which need the support of equipment, content and management provided by e-schoolbag teaching system. In this paper, the e-schoolbag teaching system is integrated with SPOC teaching. By introducing the e-schoolbag teaching system namely starC that our team developed, we then put forward an innovative SPOC instructional model supported by e-schoolbag teaching system starC. On the basis of this, we take ""Earth Movement"" course as an example and use design-based research methodology to carry out design as well as practice of SPOC teaching case. Results indicate that the model can not only well improve students' learning efficiency and all learners of the class can successfully complete SPOC learning tasks, but also improve students’ achievements in class.",Zhang Z.; Li Y.; Liu H.; Shu J.,Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2018-05-26,Central China Normal University,E-schoolbag teaching system ;  Instructional design ;  Smart classroom ;  SPOC ;  Teaching model
Perspectives of public understanding and awareness of science in China,"Technology innovation and public understanding of science are the two wings for innovation-driven development in China, and public understanding and awareness of science should be placed in the same important position as technology innovation. At present, socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered into a new era, innovation- driven development is the leading philosophy for development in China, and innovation is now the primary driving force for economic development. Public understanding of science or science popularization has thus also entered into a new era. From the perspective of scientific and technological progress, social development and policy support in the new era, a good foundation and conditions for science popularization now exists in a way that is unprecedented. At the same time, science popularization in the new era highlights new trends and characteristics: demand-oriented public awareness is more prominent; a deepening of networking and information technology continues to inject new impetus into science popularization; participants are becoming more and more diversified; and a new pattern of science popularization is being formed. Social capital is pouring in and diversified forms of science popularization are constantly emerging. Therefore, we must firmly seize the opportunity and accurately grasp the developing rules of science popularization to continuously improve its quality and level based on current demand and existing problems. We should implement informatization to improve the scope and influence of science popularization. We should adhere to both science and education to focus on cultivating the scientific consciousness and accomplishments of teenagers. Public understanding of science starts from childhood. We should perfect the system and mechanisms to construct a new pattern of science popularization with multi-faceted participation and social capital support. The interaction of technology innovation and public understanding of science (the two wings of innovation-driven development) is the call of our times for Chinese development, and constitutes an important matter as China marches on to develop into a science and technology giant. The path to the future of science popularization is still very long and we bear heavy responsibility for science public awareness. We should keep to our mission of disseminating scientific knowledge and methods, to promote the scientific spirit, to build scientific culture, to improve innovation-driven development and make our contributions to realize the China Dream of national rejuvenation.

Patent documents in STEM and PhD education: Open-source tools and some examples to open discussion,"Patents are an unused informational source in research and education. We state that patent documents are an information source opening a wide variety of usage (monitoring, strategic positioning, technical document for innovation and state of the art) for a wide variety of users (researchers, Small and medium Enterprises (SME) and start-ups). Hence, patents are a key resource in education but difficult to read. The European Patent Database (EspaceNet) offers 100 million of demands in free access mode, we consider it as a technological encyclopedia: most of its content is free of rights. As-it, Patent2Net, a free open-source patent analysis tool offers the potential to extract patents from the worldwide database and to explore huge sets of patents documents using several data mining tools and visualization techniques (dynamic networks, textometry application, classification). Scenarios of analysis are provided here to explore patent resources.

Interfaces and services for integrating games and game components into competence based courses within learning management systems,"Development of an educational game that can be integrated into a course within a Learning Management System (LMS) is a challenging task both from the didactic and from the technical point of view. A thorough evaluation of students' playing performance on LMS-side requires informative user-specific data that have to be collected during gameplay and then transferred to the LMS. Standardized interaction technologies like Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) specify mechanisms that can be applied for implementing functionality to exchange students' competence profiles and traces. The KnowledgeManagement Eco-System Portal of the European funded RAGE (Realizing an Applied Gaming Ecosystem) Research and Innovation Action project provides capable components, assets and related utility packs for developing such functionality: besides a toolkit for creating competence based games that meet the requirements of Qualifications Based Learning (QBL), assets for storing individual player profiles and traces are available. Furthermore, tools for creating game-specific analytics are provided that can be embedded by LTI-compatible LMSs like Moodle. This paper is concerned with the integration of QBL-compliant competence based games into LMS-courses.

Forming and transforming STEM teacher education: A follow up to pioneering STEM education,"This paper discusses the ongoing processes and challenges for designing an introductory undergraduate STEM Education course, as informed by the perspectives of two administrators and eleven instructors who have taught the course repeatedly, including its revisions and modifications. After four years of multiple iterations, we consider our course to be an innovative cornerstone of the undergraduate education program for several reasons including: 1) an intentional course design focus on deepening student's engagement in science, mathematics, engineering and technology content through innovations in pedagogy and inquiry approaches and, 2) a course planning process that engages instructors in continuous conversations about how to rethink and reshape current models of STEM education within authentic ecologies of research, design and connections with real-world sociotechnical contexts beyond the acquisition of technical skills. The course invites a rethinking of how STEM education can be envisioned as transdisciplinary inquiry approaches for understanding issues and problems in the inhabited world. Judging by the positive experiences of most students in the program and the increasing quality of student's final assignments and projects each year, our appraisal of the course, is very positive. Collectively, the instructional team's capacity as STEM educators has strengthened and deepened over time. We have successfully created a team of joint inquirers and developed an atmosphere of mutual support while still encouraging deep and critical engagement with the STEM Education course work. Now, we are beginning to turn our attention to the observed differences in attitudes between elementary and secondary student teachers towards STEM Education, as reported in this paper. In particular, we noticed how positive the student teachers for the early years and elementary cohorts were compared to the resistance encountered in the student teachers for the secondary cohorts. Unless this resistance is addressed, the secondary cohorts may not be able to align their future teaching in manners consistent with the goals of the education program. To gain insight into this difference, we begin to situate our observations in the traditional perspectives that frame disciplinary identity and systemic structures of schooling.",Francis K.; Yanez G.; Chapman O.; Cherkowski G.; Dodsworth D.; Friesen S.; Gereluk D.; Cockett P.; Babb A.; Shanahan M.; Takeuchi M.; Thomas C.; Turner J.,Conference Proceeding,"IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON",2018-05-23,University of Calgary,K to 12 ;  Pre-Service Teacher Education ;  STEM Education ;  STEM Identity
Entrepreneurial intentions in the field of IT: The role of gender typed personality and entrepreneurship education,"Entrepreneurship is considered as a major motor behind economic development and innovation. Tertiary students are one step away from taking serious career decisions and as a result, a large number of articles try to decipher the mechanisms behind the development of their entrepreneurial intentions. Personality traits, factors of the social environment and the role of entrepreneurship education are among the factors investigated by previous research. However, entrepreneurial intentions in the field of Information Technology remain understudied. In this research drawing from gender schemas theory and the theory of planned behavior, we investigate the impact of gender typed personality and social norms in conjunction with the role of entrepreneurial education. The sample consists of tertiary Information Technology students. In contrast to previous research, social norms have a significant impact on entrepreneurial intentions, in comparison to entrepreneurial education which has a marginally weaker effect.

Implementation of active learning method in transportation engineering seminar course: Case study at San Diego State University,"The challenges of retiring workforce, attracting new students, and high educational requirements for dealing with transportation systems complexities have been highlighted in the past decades. In response, transportation engineering (TE) education has been developing both curricula and teaching practices. However, the need for further development and implementation of active leaning techniques remains, especially with regard to specific learning context of the graduate level education. The meaningful implementation of known active learning techniques can make effective use of opportunities arising from information-communication technologies. In particular, this research focuses on development of writing-based in-class activity in a seminar graduate course at San Diego State University. The research builds upon the theoretical framework of learning in engineering education, emphasizing the learner-centered methods. Implementation of in-class activity explains the writing tool deployed and the details of the learning context. Evaluation methodology includes mid-and end-Term student survey as well as assessment rubric. Overall, results indicate that this innovation is instrumental in evaluating students' learning in the class, and in helping them with development of motivation and metacognition practices. Concluding implications provide lessons for further implementation and development of active-learning techniques in TE and engineering graduate education in general.",Machiani S.; Mladenovic M.,Conference Proceeding,"IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON",2018-05-23,College of Engineering;Aalto University,in-class activity ;  learner-centered education ;  seminar course ;  transportation engineering education
Industry-university collaboration on IoT cyber security education: Academic course: 'Resilience of Internet of Things and cyber-physical systems',"Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are an expansive heterogeneous field, where technologies are replaced faster than the engineering staff. As a consequence, traditions for education and graduation of engineers of IoT and CPS are not yet established. Cybersecurity is essential for new innovations, economic growth and public safety. On the other hand, Center for Cyber Safety and Education estimates that by 2022 there is a deficit of 350 000 cybersecurity specialists in the private sector in Europe. This paper has two contributions: First, it presents an example how an industry-university collaboration on IoT cyber security education could be organized. Then, the data be produced during the collaboration course is analyzed and compared to literature for answering to the main research question: How can future educational competences with regard to resilient cyber-physical systems be understood? Due to the multifaceted nature of the cybersecurity, previous development of degree programmes tend to synthesize either technical or societal subjects. Real multi-disciplinary synthesis has remained complicated. Our main conclusion is that future competences with regard to CPS are multidisciplinary including many industrial sectors and academic disciplines as well as multiple theories. On the other hand, traditional security thinking is not possible within new heavily interconnected systems of systems, and we should move towards resilience thinking.",Rajamaki J.,Conference Proceeding,"IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON",2018-05-23,Laurea-ammattikorkeakoulu,cyber-physical systems ;  higher education ;  Internet of things ;  research and technological development ;  resilience
A remote mode high quality international master degree program in environomical pathways for sustainable energy systems (SELECT)-pilot program experiences during first year of studies,"Remote mode study programs at master degree level are becoming more popular than undergraduate level programs. Students after graduation with Bachelors degree very often are employed and the most appropriate mode for them to pursue higher studies is the remote mode. Postgraduate programs with one or two year duration mostly focus on specific areas of research based industrial application. Traditional remote education is thought to be more centered on web based on-line programs with a little opportunity for teacher student interaction and interaction with peers. In such programs motivation for studies has been a problem and as a result many students drop off and also those remain in the program for prolonged periods do not show good performance. One of the reasons for failures of students in remote studies is the isolation leading to discouragement for the completion studies. A remote mode Master Degree Program in Environomical Pathways for Sustainable Energy Systems (MSc-SELECT), consisting of a number of innovative features aimed at improved student engagement, motivation, exposure to experiences in multi-national setting and team work, was developed and implemented by the Master School of the EIT-InnoEnergy, as a pilot project. The program was offered, collaboratively and simultaneously to students in three locations, Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya in Spain and the Open University of Sri Lanka. The students in Sweden and Spain each followed 50% of the courses on-campus and 50% in remote mode depending upon the university they registered with. The students in Sri Lanka followed the entire 1st year fully remotely. All the students (from KTH, OUSL and UPC) will spend the 2nd year on-campus at another university in the consortium. This paper discusses, from the perspective of the fully remote site, the remote program with its innovative aspects, student performance and experience together with future tasks for making the program viable and beneficial to all partner countries.",Abeyweera R.; Senanayake N.; Jayasuriya J.; Fransson T.,Conference Proceeding,"IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON",2018-05-23,The Open University of Sri Lanka;The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH);EIT InnoEnergy,Challenge Driven Education ;  Energy Technology ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Innovation ;  Remote Education ;  Sustainability
An industry-Academia model for research,"This study presents a simple projectized organization used in the Research Center on Microsystems and Biodesign at Tecnologico de Monterrey. The proposed work model aims to increase the interaction between undergraduate and postgraduate students in a project-management based industrial model applied to research. The main purpose of this study is to demonstrate how this organizational structure helps to increase innovation, speed-up research, and increase the students' skills. The roles assigned to students and advisors in multidisciplinary groups create a synergic interaction among members that allows for an interruption-free working environment. The strengths of this model and the methodology to implement it are presented. The model adds value to the curricula and helps to comply with the metrics established by national and international accreditation institutions. Knowledge transfer is an important aspect in the development of projects because of the high turnover rate in academia during the development of global products. Therefore, it is important to avoid repetitive tasks to save time. The implementation of this model has provided the development of functional prototypes, the graduation of participating students with project management experience, and a global increase in scientific production.",Reyes J.; Ramirez-Mendoza R.; Rogelio Bustamante Bello M.,Conference Proceeding,"IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON",2018-05-23,Tecnológico de Monterrey,heritage of knowledge (key words) ;  industry model ;  project-management ;  Projectized organization
The use of WhatsApp in design-based modules,"WhatsApp is used by 1.2 billion users worldwide. This social media platform is also used as an educational tool and has been the focus of many studies in higher education. WhatsApp was used as an educational tool to improve communication, to promote student engagement and to provide better student support in two design-based modules, namely Projects II and Design Project III, at the Central University of Technology (CUT) in South Africa. The purpose of this paper is to present a case study with descriptive statistics of quantitative data regarding student perceptions on the use of WhatsApp in these design-based modules. Student perceptions are important when new technologies are introduced and can be used to assess such teaching innovations. The research question thus arises, what are the perceived advantages and disadvantages of using WhatsApp in design-based modules at CUT? The results suggest that students have a generally positive view of WhatsApp as an educational tool that helps them to connect with others and collect information in a quicker and easier fashion (these are identified advantages). Disadvantages, listed by a minority of respondents, included the cost of airtime in South Africa, limited bandwidth and being distracted by using WhatsApp for other purposes. Although this study has focused on the use of WhatsApp in design-based modules, it will be interesting to investigate the use of several social media platforms over a range of modules offered at CUT.",Hertzog P.; Swart A.,Conference Proceeding,"IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON",2018-05-23,"Central University of Technology, Free State",Design-based learning ;  Project-based learning ;  WhatsApp

Water Disasters and Their Countermeasures in Mountains,"Big natural disasters worldwide are deeply affecting survival and development of humankind. How to effectively deal with various types of natural disasters is particularly important. After the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, public awareness about disasters in China has increased considerably and people's understanding of disasters has been greatly improved. That "" People on the Earth must have disaster awareness and disaster education"" has already become the common sense. Owing to its particular regional geological structure, topographic conditions, hydro-meteorology and other factors, the Western China is a region with frequent water-related disasters. Prevention of and reduction in water disasters have been important for overall development of the region and the country. As a high-level research national university in West China, building on the wisdom of water management of the historical Dujiangyan project, Sichuan University has made many innovations. Through engineering and research projects, such as flood discharge and flood control of high dams, structural safety of high dam projects, prevention of mountain torrents,sediment disasters,and landslides, and ecological environmental protection in river basins, Sichuan University has made a series of important achievements. They include: 1) development of meso-scale experiments and simulation techniques to reveal the meso-mechanism of complex water flow phenomena of high dam hydraulics, to establish more reliable criteria and calculation methods, to form a systematic meso-mechanical system, and to innovatively propose multi-level flood discharge mechanism and techniques; 2) new technology of geomechanical model destruction simulation and comprehensive test, which can reveal the overall structural safety response mechanism of high dam engineering, and establishment of a high dam-foundation-reservoir safety evaluation system capable of accurately reflecting the influence of complex geological environments and excessive floods; 3) revealing the "" little water with big disaster"" mechanism under joint action of mountain floods and sedimentation, and development of the "" reduction of scale control and prevention"" technology for extreme flood and sediment disasters that can make the uncertainty of the disasters caused by floods and sediments to a preventable scale; 4) introduction of new equipment and technologies such as the three-dimensional laser scanners for landslide deformation monitoring and expansion from "" points, lines, and surfaces"" to three-dimensional space as a whole, which improves the level of disaster monitoring and early warning of water-powered landslides and disaster emergency response capabilities; 5) a categorized emergency and comprehensive treatment technology for landslide-barrier lakes suitable to various material composition and structural characteristics of landslides and dams; 6) a complete set of methods for ecological water requirement allocation and prediction of water temperature for fish and cascade reservoirs, low-temperature water control, and prediction and regulation of over-saturated total dissolved gas of high dams aiming at characteristics of geography, ecology and environment in southwest region, which has expanded research on ecological and environmental protection from the local engineering and single water environment areas to the overall system of mountain river basins and formed an integrated scientific and technological system that intersects multiple disciplines. At last, aiming at characteristics of water disasters in mountainous rivers in Western China and the general needs for national disaster prevention, mitigation and relief, this paper proposes a series of scientific and technological questions for future research, which will facilitate development of research work in related disciplines for disaster prevention and reduction in the future. The issues include impacts of global climate change on water disasters, coupled disaster environments and regional evolution laws, dynamic processes and catastrophes of water disasters, habitat-biological interaction mechanisms of mutant rivers, ecological evolution mechanism of catastrophic rivers, water disaster risk theory, water disaster monitoring and early warning, collaborative management of water and disaster basins, basic large databases and cloud platforms, and others.",Xie H.; Xu W.; Liu C.; Yang X.; Xie H.; Nie R.; Zhou J.; An R.; Tian Z.; Xiao M.,Journal,Gongcheng Kexue Yu Jishu/Advanced Engineering Sciences,2018-05-20,Sichuan University,Disaster prevention and mitigation ;  Ecological environment protection in river basins ;  Flood discharge and control safety ;  Mountain floods and sediment disasters ;  Mountain rivers ;  Structural safety of high dam projects ;  Water disasters

Adoption and implementation of BIM – case study of a Saudi Arabian AEC firm,"Purpose: The adoption of building information modeling (BIM) technology in the global architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industries is steadily increasing. However, developing countries such as Saudi Arabia are still lagging behind. The purpose of this paper is to present a framework for BIM adoption in the AEC industry in Saudi Arabia through a case study. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted a two-pronged approach. First, the various stages, benefits and challenges of BIM implementation in a local AEC firm’s pilot project were documented. Then, a BIM maturity measurement of the pilot project was conducted, and identification of the areas where improvements can be made. Findings: BIM implementation provided several benefits and efficiency gains. These include a faster design processes, effective reuse of information and overall client satisfaction. Challenges faced include a lack of interest by clients and industry stakeholders, inadequate experience of the BIM team, and lack of mentorship from a BIM champion. The findings of the BIM maturity measurement were presented as an implementation framework in the five process areas and ten subject areas of the Project Management Institute’s (PMI) project management framework. Originality/value: Though, frameworks, guidelines and protocols have been developed to facilitate the successful adoption of BIM, the issue is not a case of “one size fits all.” This study thus introduces the much needed awareness in the research and professional domain in Saudi Arabia. It also presents the proposed framework in the PMI framework, which is an incremental innovation to previous work.",Almuntaser T.; Sanni-Anibire M.; Hassanain M.,Journal,International Journal of Managing Projects in Business,2018-05-17,Dammam Community College;King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals,BIM maturity ;  Case study ;  Framework ;  Implementation ;  Life cycle ;  Saudi Arabia
Nanostructured superhard materials,"Superhard materials play irreplaceable roles in the industry areas including mechanical processing, oil exploration, geological exploration, etc., as well as in the scientific fields such as earth science and high pressure science. Developing high-performance superhard materials with extraordinary hardness, fracture toughness, and thermal stability has been a long-lasting goal for both scientific and industrial communities. Natural diamond has been thought of the hardest material in nature since it was discovered in ancient India more than 6000 years ago. Ever since the successful synthesis of diamond in the laboratory in 1955, finding artificial materials with hardness exceeding that of the natural diamond has been a pursued dream of human beings. However, this is truly a challenge to materials science, and many researchers have argued that it is impossible to fulfill this dream. In 2003, we proposed a microscopic understanding of the indentation hardness as the combined resistance of chemical bonds in a material to indentation, and established a microscopic hardness model for covalent single crystals. This model reveals several key factors, such as short and strong chemical bonds, high valence electron density or high bond density, and strongly directional bonds, which are beneficial to enhance the hardness. On the base of the hardness model for covalent single crystals, we systematically investigated the hardening mechanisms in polycrystalline covalent materials, and established a hardness model for polycrystalline covalent materials. Two main hardening effects in polycrystalline covalent materials are identified, namely the Hall-Petch effect and the quantum confinement effect, both of which contribute increasingly to hardness with decreasing microstructural characteristic size. As a result, polycrystalline covalent materials can be continually hardened with the microstructural characteristic size down to the deep nanoscale, which is significantly different from the nanostructured metals and designates a brand-new direction to greatly enhance the hardness of covalent materials. Nanograining and nanotwinning are two popular strategies to minimize the microstructures. Twin boundaries possess excess energy typically one order of magnitude lower than that of grain boundaries. Nanowinning thus provides a more effective mechanism to achieve smaller microstructural characteristic size compared with nanograining. We proposed a novel idea to significantly enhance the performance of diamond and cubic boron nitride (cBN) through forming ultrathin nanotwinned microstructures, and synthesized nanotwinned diamond and cBN bulks from onion-structured carbon and boron nitride precursors, respectively, via martensitic phase transformations under high pressure and high temperature. Nanotwinned diamond and cBN both shows greatly enhanced hardness, fracture toughness and thermal stability compared with the corresponding single crystals due to the formation of ultrathin nanotwins. The hardness of nanotwinned diamond reaches 200 GPa, twice as high as that of natural diamond and turning the dream of synthesizing a material harder than natural diamond into reality. In addition, there is no hardness anisotropy or cleavage features typical for single crystals due to the randomly oriented nanograins and nanotwins. The successful synthesis of nanotwinned ultrahard materials is a great promotion to the high-performance superhard materials research. With these advantages in performance, nanotwinned ultrahard materials can produce technological innovations in industry and high pressure science.",Tian Y.,Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2018-05-15,Yanshan University,Fracture toughness ;  Hardening mechanism ;  Nanostructuring ;  Nanotwin ;  Superhard materials ;  Thermal stability
Storylab lessons: A collaborative project between courses in journalism and media technology,"This article examines Storylab, a collaborative learning project between the journalism programme at Stockholm University and the engineering programme in media technology at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, designed to combine journalistic storytelling with pervasive media technology. The aim of the study is to identify and reflect on the challenges associated with the approach. The methods used are a survey and semi-structured interviews with the students. The analyses draw on research concerning the current main challenges for the news industry and journalism educators. The results show that Storylab was highly appreciated, and provided students with useful skills for their professional lives. However, not all groups worked well together, and some students wished that the collaboration had been more extensive. Differences in motivations and priorities were mentioned as restraining factors. Therefore, it is argued that for a sustainable media landscape, journalists and engineers must collaborate, and that this cooperation can be brought about during professional training.",Hultén G.; Picha Edwardsson M.,Journal,Nordicom Review,2018-05-15,Stockholms universitet;The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH),Collaborative learning ;  Higher education ;  Innovation ;  Professional training ;  Storytelling
Exploring coastal development scenarios for Zanzibar: A local microcosm-inspired Delphi survey,"Tropical coastal systems are undergoing rapid change, which impacts people and natural resources, and that requires innovative governance processes to be turned into an opportunity for sustainable management. Focusing on Unguja, the main island of the Zanzibar archipelago in Tanzania, this study explores the current state of the island's coastal systems, as well as probable and desirable scenarios for the future. Based on a two-round iterative Delphi survey aimed at coastal science & management experts, research priorities are identified, and explorative scenarios are proposed. The findings indicate that demographic pressure is expected to have a high impact, and that competing coastal land use claims balancing between tourism infrastructure development and local fisheries-related land are to be expected. Sustainable alternative livelihood strategies are however expected to be part of the solution, for a resilient coastal system, if inclusive governance and management strategies are put in place, e.g. regarding access to coastal resources. This study combines the predictive and normative components of explorative scenarios and its approach and findings can be inspiring in the whole Western Indian Ocean region, beyond the Zanzibar case study.",Hugé J.; Van Puyvelde K.; Munga C.; Dahdouh-Guebas F.; Koedam N.,Journal,Ocean and Coastal Management,2018-05-15,Technical University of Mombasa;Universiteit Gent;Vrije Universiteit Brussel;Universiteit Hasselt;Université Libre de Bruxelles,Coastal management ;  Delphi ;  Scenarios ;  Sustainability assessment ;  Zanzibar

Routing at compile time,"The rapid evolution of modern C++ programming language has completely changed the way developers write high-performance and robust applications. By modern, we mean C++17, which has revolutionized the 'old-fashion' C++98 in many aspects such as meta-programming, concurrency controls, and functional programming. Despite the tremendous progress in language innovation, research on how these advanced features can improve EDA programs is still nascent. In this paper, we introduce a novel routing framework using the technique of generalized constant expression in C++17. Our framework allows a router to take advantage of compile-time computation and thus can save a significant amount of engineering effort that would otherwise be issued every time the program runs. By prescribing computation at compile time, the compiler is able to further produce more optimized codes to run faster than ever before. We have evaluated our framework on classic routing problems and have demonstrated promising performance gain over which is done solely at runtime. Our framework has the potential to change many fundamental EDA building blocks and thus can achieve better tool performance and engineering productivity.",Lin C.; Huang T.; Wong M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design, ISQED",2018-05-09,The Grainger College of Engineering,

Managing Foreign R&D in China: Managers of international R&D and innovation in China relate the lessons they have learned—what works and what doesn’t,"OVERVIEW: China has become one of the most desired locations in which to do R&D. However, it has little innovation of its own, and intellectual property protection is weak. This raises questions: Is China R&D more hype than reality? Do cost advantages really outweigh the risk of losing technology to Chinese competitors?

Full-scale accelerated pavement testing with the MLS30 on innovative testing infrastructures,"Germany is one of the most important networks to cope the commercial transport on the continent due to its central geographic position in Europe. Therefore, there is a need for the assessment of innovations in pavement design and construction materials. Full-scale accelerated pavement tests (APT) are one of the most powerful tools to close the gap between laboratory testing and in situ tests under real traffic loads. Therefore, the German Federal Highway Research Institute (BASt) decided to get an APT device Pave®MLS30, which loads test sections with a rolling wheel. Several initial projects have been successfully completed. In 2016, the construction of the new testing and reference areal duraBASt will be completed. duraBASt is located inside of a large motorway cross section.

Innovation and employee injury risk in automotive disassembly operations,"Engineering innovations in car disassembly systems are studied for affects on system operators’ risk of repetitive strain injury (RSI). Objective instrumented measures of injury risk factors with synchronised video-based task analyses were used to examine changes in operators’ RSI risk during two cases of engineering innovation: (1) a shift in industrial model from traditional extracting saleable parts to line-based full material recovery, and (2) the prospective effects of a simulated ‘Lean’-inspired process improvement in the line system. Both cases of innovation showed significantly increased movement speeds and reduced muscular recovery opportunities, implying increased RSI risk. This case study reveals a mechanism by which innovation may increase RSI risks for operators. Managers responsible for engineering innovation should ensure their teams have the tools and mandate necessary to control injury hazards as part of the development and design process. These cases suggest how failure to manage RSI hazards in the innovation process may allow increases of injury risks that can compromise operational performance. This ‘innovation pitfall’ has implications for operator health and organisational sustainability. Alternative pathways are discussed.",Neumann W.; Winkel J.; Palmerud G.; Forsman M.,Journal,International Journal of Production Research,2018-05-03,Hogskolan i Gavle;Toronto Metropolitan University;Göteborgs Universitet;Karolinska Institutet;Technical University of Denmark,back-track factory ;  corporate social sustainability ;  engineering design ;  ergonomics ;  human factors ;  manufacturing ;  physical workload ;  rationalisation

Understanding the scope for a product design education discourse on additive manufacturing,"Background Additive manufacturing has the potential to disrupt conventional manufacturing. The argument presented in this article is that because product design students need to be achieving an advanced level of design for additive manufacturing to effectively utilise the technology in the near future, product design academics need to be researching the development of more advanced, discipline specific, learning objectives for designing to their constraints and opportunities. These need to address designing for complex technical applications and critically engage with implications for the future of design for manufacturing. The rationale underpinning this argument is based on a systematic quantitative literature review of research addressing design for additive manufacturing education. Methods The systematic quantitative literature review provides a survey view of a sample data-base (Scopus), focussing on peer reviewed journal articles and conference papers, and also analysis of two leading design research journals, Design Studies and Design Issues based on searches capturing data on additive manufacturing or 3D printing, product design and education. These were refined by date, authority (based on publication source) and relevance. The analysis provides an overview of the product design discipline's response to the topic and highlights issues. Results An initial scoping search of the terms for title, abstract or keywords in Scopus identified 3720 published articles, from 2009-2017 rising each year: 59, 67, 84, 125, 192, 358, 666, 949, 1220. The data from a systematic quantitative literature review was analysed through the lens of sociotechnology theory, to foster a perspective on educational research at the intersection of technology and society. The results showed the majority of peer reviewed publications were written by engineering and architecture researchers, rather than product design academics (11%). Analysis of design publications showed an emphasis on 3D printing as a prototyping tool supporting other learning activities, rather than a focus in itself. A small proportion of publications advanced design for additive manufacturing education, both technically and in a broader economic, environmental and social context. Conclusions Overall, product design academics are not demonstrating the same level of engagement with research into additive manufacturing other discipline faculty members are, for example engineering and architectural. The implications are that a body of knowledge specific to product design is not being developed at the same pace and the potential disruption of design for manufacturing principles, practice and organization by additive manufacturing not yet addressed.",Loy J.,Journal,Archives of Design Research,2018-05-01,University of Technology Sydney,3D printing ;  Digital ;  Disruption ;  Innovation ;  Technology
Rawls’s Wide Reflective Equilibrium as a Method for Engaged Interdisciplinary Collaboration: Potentials and Limitations for the Context of Technological Risks,"The introduction of new technologies in society is sometimes met with public resistance. Supported by public policy calls for “upstream engagement” and “responsible innovation,” recent years have seen a notable rise in attempts to attune research and innovation processes to societal needs, so that stakeholders’ concerns are taken into account in the design phase of technology. Both within the social sciences and in the ethics of technology, we see many interdisciplinary collaborations being initiated that aim to address tensions between various normative expectations about science and engineering and the actual outcomes. However, despite pleas to integrate social science research into the ethics of technology, effective normative models for assessing technologies are still scarce. Rawls’s wide reflective equilibrium (WRE) is often mentioned as a promising approach to integrate insights from the social sciences in the normative analysis of concrete cases, but an in-depth discussion of how this would work in practice is still lacking. In this article, we explore to what extent the WRE method can be used in the context of technology development. Using cases in engineering and technology development, we discuss three issues that are currently neglected in the applied ethics literature on WRE. The first issue concerns the operationalization of abstract background theories to moral principles. The second issue concerns the inclusiveness of the method and the demand for openness. The third issue is how to establish whether or not an equilibrium has been reached. These issues should be taken into account when applying the methods to real-world cases involving technological risks. Applying the WRE method in the context of engaged interdisciplinary collaboration requires sensitivity for issues of power and representativeness to properly deal with the dynamics between the technical and normative researchers involved as well as society at large.",Doorn N.; Taebi B.,Journal,Science Technology and Human Values,2018-05-01,"Faculteit Techniek, Bestuur en Management, TU Delft",engaged interdisciplinary collaboration ;  moral acceptability ;  responsible innovation ;  social acceptance ;  sociotechnical integration ;  technological risks ;  wide reflective equilibrium
Frugal innovation: A review and research agenda,"This study aims to review the frugal innovation literature in order to understand the main sources, theories, and overlapping concepts, as well as the input, success factors, impeding factors, and output of frugal innovations (FIs). A systematic research approach was applied in this study to synthesize the frugal innovation literature. Using a standard research review protocol, 101 relevant articles were extracted from 11 publication databases. We found that even though frugal innovation literature is in an embryonic stage there are over a dozen of definitions of it. This study analyses various definition of frugal innovation. The FI concept overlaps with a large number of other concepts, thus hindering the pace of FI research. Combining many overlapping concepts into one - frugal innovation - would help to develop frugal innovation as a well-established discipline. The theoretical development of frugal innovation discipline is still in an early stage. Hence, theory-driven studies are necessary. FIs are emerging from numerous sources as such exploring it from various levels and units of analysis are important. FI requires a significant change in a firm's approach to innovation. It plays an important role in sustainability. Based on the analysis of the extant frugal innovation literature, this study points out research agenda.",Hossain M.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2018-05-01,Aalto University,Frugal innovation ;  Impeding factors ;  Input ;  Outcomes ;  Success factors ;  Theoretical perspectives

Absorptive capacity for need knowledge: Antecedents and effects for employee innovativeness,"Innovation occurs when knowledge about unmet customer needs intersects with knowledge about technological solutions. Both knowledge types are often located outside the firm and need to be absorbed in order for innovation to occur. While there has been extensive research into absorptive capacity for solution knowledge, a necessary complement − absorptive capacity for new customer needs − has been neglected. In an individual-level study of 864 employees from a home appliance firm, we show that need absorptive capacity is theoretically and empirically distinct from solution absorptive capacity, and that both are positively associated with employee innovativeness. Interestingly, we find asymmetric extra-domain effects: prior solution knowledge is positively related to need absorptive capacity (cross-pollination effect), while prior need knowledge is negatively related to solution absorptive capacity (attenuation effect). We contrast the cognitive underpinnings of the two absorptive capacity types, contributing to emerging scholarly thinking on the domain-specificity and micro foundations of absorptive capacity.",Schweisfurth T.; Raasch C.,Journal,Research Policy,2018-05-01,"TUM School of Management, Munich;Kühne Logistics University;Institut für Weltwirtschaft an der Universität Kiel;University of Southern Denmark, Sønderborg",Absorptive capacity ;  Individual level ;  Innovativeness ;  Need knowledge ;  Quantitative ;  Solution knowledge
Radiation resistant fiber Bragg grating in random air-line fibers for sensing applications in nuclear reactor cores,"This paper reports the testing results of radiation resistant fiber Bragg grating (FBG) in random air-line (RAL) fibers in comparison with FBGs in other radiation-hardened fibers. FBGs in RAL fibers were fabricated by 80 fs ultrafast laser pulse using a phase mask approach. The fiber Bragg gratings tests were carried out in the core region of a 6 MW MIT research reactor (MITR) at a steady temperature above 600°C and an average fast neutron (>1 MeV) flux >1.2 × 1014 n/cm2/s. Fifty five-day tests of FBG sensors showed less than 5 dB reduction in FBG peak strength after over 1 × 1020 n/cm2 of accumulated fast neutron dose. The radiation-induced compaction of FBG sensors produced less than 5.5 nm FBG wavelength shift toward shorter wavelength. To test temporal responses of FBG sensors, a number of reactor anomaly events were artificially created to abruptly change reactor power, temperature, and neutron flux over short periods of time. The thermal sensitivity and temporal responses of FBGs were determined at different accumulated doses of neutron flux. Results presented in this paper reveal that temperature-stable Type-II FBGs fabricated in radiation-hardened fibers can survive harsh in-pile conditions. Despite large parameter drift induced by strong nuclear radiation, further engineering and innovation on both optical fibers and fiber devices could lead to useful fiber sensors for various in-pile measurements to improve safety and efficiency of existing and next generation nuclear reactors.",Zaghloul M.; Wang M.; Huang S.; Hnatovsky C.; Grobnic D.; Mihailov S.; Li M.; Carpenter D.; Hu L.; Joshua D.; Laffont G.; Nehr S.; Chen K.,Journal,Optics Express,2018-04-30,Swanson School of Engineering;Massachusetts Institute of Technology;National Research Council Canada;Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives;Idaho National Laboratory;Corning Incorporated,
Understanding how engineering identity and belongingness predict grit for first-generation college students,"Increasing the participation of underrepresented students, including first-generation college students, in engineering plays a central role in sustaining the U.S. research and innovation capacity. Diversity continues to be recognized as an asset in engineering. However, we also know that the culture of engineering has an implicit assumption about who can be and who is recognized as an engineer. There is also a complex relationship between participation in a community of practice and identity. Diverse students must not only author an identity as an engineer but also must grapple with how that identity, historically constructed as white and masculine, becomes a part of how they see themselves. This research study uses structural equation modeling to examine how first-generation college students' engineering identity and sense of belongingness in engineering serve as mediators for students' grit in terms of persistence of effort and consistency of interest. Results reveal that engineering identity has a positive direct effect on students' sense of belongingness. Both engineering identity and belongingness have a positive direct effect on persistence of effort but were not significant predictors of consistency of interest. Additionally, belongingness is a mediator between engineering identity and persistence of effort. These results begin to uncover how grit is not a stand-alone measure and defies the idea that some students have it while others do not. Persistence of effort is present for first-generation college students when they see themselves as the kinds of people that can do engineering and feel a sense of belongingness within the field. The results of this work highlights ways to support grit development in first-generation college students.",Verdín D.; Godwin A.; Kirn A.; Benson L.; Potvin G.,Conference Proceeding,CoNECD 2018 - Collaborative Network for Engineering and Computing Diversity Conference,2018-04-29,"College of Engineering;Clemson University;Florida International University;University of Nevada, Reno",
Cyber-physical laboratories in engineering and science education,"This volume investigates a number of issues needed to develop a modular, effective, versatile, cost effective, pedagogically-embedded, user-friendly, and sustainable online laboratory system that can deliver its true potential in the national and global arenas. This allows individual researchers to develop their own modular systems with a level of creativity and innovation while at the same time ensuring continuing growth by separating the responsibility for creating online laboratories from the responsibility for overseeing the students who use them. The volume first introduces the reader to several system architectures that have proven successful in many online laboratory settings. The following chapters then describe real-life experiences in the area of online laboratories from both technological and educational points of view. The volume further collects experiences and evidence on the effective use of online labs in the context of a diversity of pedagogical issues. It also illustrates successful online laboratories to highlight best practices as case studies and describes the technological design strategies, implementation details, and classroom activities as well as learning from these developments. Finally the volume describes the creation and deployment of commercial products, tools and services for online laboratory development. It also provides an idea about the developments that are on the horizon to support this area.",Auer M.; Azad A.; Edwards A.; de Jong T.,Book,Cyber-Physical Laboratories in Engineering and Science Education,2018-04-26,Universidad de Colima;Universiteit Twente;Fachhochschule Kärnten;Northern Illinois University,
Product-service systems business models for circular supply chains,"Shifting supply chains from linear to closed-loop models is an important step towards circular economy. This paper investigates business model innovation for circular supply chains, and proposes that product-service systems (PSS) business models can enhance the circularity of supply chains through value creation in inner circles, circling long and cascading use circles. It adopts an exploratory case study method of a large Chinese manufacturing firm operating a traditional product-based business model and three types of PSS business models (i.e. product-, use- and result-oriented PSSs). The supply chain operations of the four distinct business models are analysed and their associated circularities are discussed. The findings show that business models akin to result-oriented PSS, have tighter and more efficient cycles of supply chain operations; which means, the repair, reuse and remanufacturing system is faster and the rate is higher. This research contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between business model innovation and supply chain circularity.",Yang M.; Smart P.; Kumar M.; Jolly M.; Evans S.,Journal,Production Planning and Control,2018-04-26,University of Cambridge;University of Exeter;University of Bristol;Cranfield University,business model innovation ;  circular business models ;  circular economy ;  Circular supply chains ;  product-service systems
Technology foresight at a University Research Center in Mexico: Design and first results,"Technology and corporate foresight has gained recognition as an instrument to aid the identification, construction and support of technological strategic decisions in organizations. Research and Development Centers (RDC)-a part of the National System of Science Technology and Innovation (SNCTI) in Mexico-could benefit from the results of a foresight process. One of the aims of technology foresight is to ""identify areas of strategic research"" (Martin, 1995). The main purpose of this paper is to present the progress and preliminary results of the application of a technology foresight process in a university research and development center in Mexico. The technology foresight process was designed based on a literature review-foresight, strategic planning and knowledge management- and is being applied in the Engineering Institute of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (IIUNAM), one of the main research centers in the country. A systems thinking approach is being used in order to identify the mayor stakeholders involved in the strategic planning of the IIUNAM. Research topics of interest (TI) for the IIUNAM were identified to guide the foresight process. For each TI selected, specific research topic (ST) were stablished which will be used to guide the scenario analysis in a next stage of the work. The methodology applied and first results of the technology foresight process is shown. The TI analysed is called: Natural Hazards in Civil Engineering and the ST corresponds to Structural Reliability.",Castillo-Camarena N.; Lopez-Ortega E.; Garcia-Cano E.,Conference Proceeding,"Towards Sustainable Technologies and Innovation - Proceedings of the 27th Annual Conference of the International Association for Management of Technology, IAMOT 2018",2018-04-25,Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México,Corporate foresight ;  Mexico ;  Strategic planning ;  Technology foresight ;  University research and development centers
Technology adoption: Factors influencing the adoption decision of the internet of things in a business environment,"The Internet of things (IoT) represents a new paradigm of integration of various technologies and communication solutions, and finds applications in many different domains. This topic has had little exploration in the social sciences and this study helps bridge that gap by investigating the challenge of adopting innovations based on the Internet of Things (IoT), more specifically factors that affect the adoption decision. The realization of the vision of IoT still requires more investment in research and development because of its novelty and complexity. Beyond the technical issues, large-scale adoption is also hampered by the lack of clarity regarding which factors influence the adoption decision of these technologies. The theme adoption of innovation is relevant to those who develop an innovation and want it to be adopted as well as to those who have to decide whether to adopt an innovation or not. As the adoption rate is influenced by factors and decisions that lie both on the side of the supplier as well as the adopter of a technological innovation, this work is based on studies that seek to integrate variables from both sides in order to reflect the systemic nature of this process. Given the nature and novelty of the technology whose adoption is the object of this study, the chosen methodology was multiple case studies, exploratory and qualitative in nature. For the case studies, a total of 8 interviews were conducted and the collection of data was complemented with internal documentation which included executive summaries and detailed information on project execution. The proposed model looked at 4 dimensions: external, internal, technological, and supplier. The first objective was to apply the model to both case studies in order to identify and analyze the key factors influencing the adoption decision for the Internet of things in each company. The second objective was to do a deeper analysis on how the factors related to the technological dimension affected the adoption decision. A comparative analysis was also developed for a deeper understanding of how nuances related to each case may have contributed to the findings, whether these were similar or divergent. What the research has shown is that the model and its factors helped to organize the key issues for analysis in the adoption decision process, serving as support for future studies related to business modelling of IoT solutions. Given the case study methodology, the results cannot be generalized. The proposed model can be applied to both suppliers and adopters of the technological innovation, integrating factors that are external and internal to the company, as well as factors of the IoT technology and factors of the supplier. The model can be easily adapted to serve as a tool in the evaluation and eventual selection of technological innovations.",Lobo F.; Vasconcellos E.; Guedes L.,Conference Proceeding,"Towards Sustainable Technologies and Innovation - Proceedings of the 27th Annual Conference of the International Association for Management of Technology, IAMOT 2018",2018-04-25,Universidade de São Paulo,Innovation ;  Internet of Things ;  IoT ;  Technology adoption
Innovation and intellectual property management - Integrative approach for competitiveness,"With development of science and technology, the world has seen shifts in economy from farming to industry to knowledge. To protect this knowledge, intellectual property (IP) regimes are evolved. It is not just IP generation that helps in growth and development but its efficient management also determines its role for wealth creation and well being of the society. IP management requires expertise in law, technology and management. Many organizations especially organizations from developing countries face IP management issue due to lack of availability of expertise in the domain. There are various IP management audit models available but they are either sector specific or IP specific and lack holistic approach. Hence there is a need of holistic IP management approach and IP management audit model which will help IP and technology managers to handle IP management without much involvement of IP experts. This paper introduces an IP management (IPM) audit model which is easy to implement and does not require any specific IP expertise. The study adopted qualitative and exploratory research methodology. Type 3 case study method and data triangulation are followed. The focus of the research is limited to 8 types of IP. The proposed model with systematic categorization of IPM activities focuses on reducing the complexity of the IPM system (IPMS) of an organization. The validation of the proposed IPM audit model confirmed potential IP identification and helped to reveal the gaps in the current IPMS of an organization. This IP model will be useful to IP and technology managers to map the current IP management practices and improve the IPM system based on it. The research is limited to electrical engineering sector. Although the study can be expanded further for other sectors.",Gargate G.,Conference Proceeding,"Towards Sustainable Technologies and Innovation - Proceedings of the 27th Annual Conference of the International Association for Management of Technology, IAMOT 2018",2018-04-25,,Intellectual property management ;  Intellectual property management audit model ;  Intellectual property management system
Technology management education: A global perspective,"Technology management is a dynamic and evolving profession, driven by changes in technology, globalization, sustainability, and the increasing importance of the service economy. Technology management professionals must be better prepared for the challenges they will face in the future due to rapidly changing technologies and increased globalization. The purpose of this paper is to present findings of an international study on technology management education. The study was designed to identify the optimal curricular elements for effective technology management programs in today's rapidly changing environment. Much of the research on technology management education occurred more than ten years ago and focused on regional or limited populations. The importance of this study is its relevance to today's academic concerns and its global perspective. An online quantitative survey was used to solicit feedback from technology professionals to identify the knowledge, skills, abilities and behaviours necessary for technology managers. Management of technological change, project management, and management of information, quality management, innovation and product development as well as strategic management of technology competencies were addressed. Over 1,500 technology management professionals and technology management graduates were surveyed. Upon completion of the survey respondents were asked to forward a survey link to other technology professionals using a snowball sampling method to garner input from a larger population. Over 350 surveys were completed by respondents from 30 different countries. Almost 86% of the respondents indicated that they were employed full-time in a variety of industry sectors; including aerospace, chemicals, computers and information technology, education, energy, manufacturing, and research and development.

"A case study of science, technology and innovation networks: The triple helix at Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru","In this paper we present an exploratory research to analyze the case of the innovation networks at Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru (PUCP), which is a promotor of the Triple Helix Model formed by government, industry and academy. After ten years of experience with government financing instruments, and private investment, the internal research and innovation system at PUCP has been capable to generate a network based on the Triple Helix Model. The methodology used in the present research combines: i) the revision of secondary sources related to university, industry and government documentation; ii) the revision of primary sources, from interviews to stakeholders, and the management of research and innovation office at PUCP, iii) analysis of social networks of innovation at PUCP with the Graphos Method, in order to find relationships and results from the stakeholders. We analyze the results obtained from the period 2008-2016 with one of the financing instruments from the Peruvian government, where the industry associates with the university. From the results obtained, it was possible to identify the principal funding resources, the type of relationships of the innovation networks at PUCP, how the internal and external financial instruments are used by the stakeholders, and the attitude towards future developments and improvements. Finally, a proposal to improve and strengthen the management of the Triple Helix Model at PUCP is presented. The aim is to strengthen its actual network, and provide information to other institutions for replication, in order to achieve social and economic development based on science, technology and innovation (STI) in the region.",Cuellar F.; Gonzalez D.,Conference Proceeding,"Towards Sustainable Technologies and Innovation - Proceedings of the 27th Annual Conference of the International Association for Management of Technology, IAMOT 2018",2018-04-25,Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru,Innovation networks ;  Knowledge management ;  Triple helix
Support of process improvement activities to products and processes innovation: Cases in innovative companies,"The Process Improvement (PI) is associated with the support of incremental innovations only, it is important to consider that PI can support radical process and product innovations. The aim of this paper is to verify whether and how PI can help product and process innovation and the main practices that allow this support. To verify how PI can help product and process innovation were used a Systematic Literature Review to identify which practices allow PI assists innovation and through multiple case studies were confirmed, detailed and identified new practices and the difficulties to PI assists innovation. The case studies were performed in four Brazilian companies, classified as the most innovative in their industry. Three of the analyzed companies indicated that the PI can assist in product innovation. The main practices identified are: sharing goals; stimulate the PI during product development; information sharing; participation of people from PI in product innovation team; and involvement of PI in product development activities. All the analyzed companies indicated that the PI can assist in process innovation. The practices identified are: encouraging the generation of innovative ideas of people from PI; free flow of ideas and information sharing and transformation of PI ideas into process innovation projects. Future research can explore in more depth how companies can foster the relationship between PI and innovation by identifying factors that may influence this relationship and performance outcomes, single-industry studies and a larger number of firms enable greater understanding of the theme. The paper allows a reflection on the role of PI in relation to radical innovation of products and processes. The managerial implications involve the promotion of interaction between PI and radical innovation projects. And the results show that the PI can foster and encourage radical innovations. The research contributes to the management and theoretical fields, discussing new advantages to the use of PI. Although it is a relevant topic with managerial implications, there are no studies on what practices can be used to foster the contribution of PI to product and process innovation.",Lizarelli F.; De Toledo J.; Ishizaka A.; Allipradini D.,Conference Proceeding,"Towards Sustainable Technologies and Innovation - Proceedings of the 27th Annual Conference of the International Association for Management of Technology, IAMOT 2018",2018-04-25,Universidade Federal de São Carlos;FEI University,Multiple case studies ;  Process improvement ;  Process innovation ;  Product innovation
Modelling the dynamics of renewable energy technologies: A review of past experience and future opportunities,"This paper reviews the use of formal quantitative models, i.e. simulation modeling that have been used to explore and explain emergent dynamics of the development and diffusion of renewable energy technologies under three different systems frameworks namely the technological innovation system (TIS), innovation ecosystems (IE) and multi-level perspective (MLP). Specifically, we aim to explore the main similarities and differences on the use of these three systems frameworks by using the following analytical dimensions: i) core elements, building blocks and organizing principles; ii) dynamics and iii) modelling approaches and applications. As main result, we find the dominant use of system dynamics modeling and agent-based modeling on all three frameworks, however, with differences in their goals, modelling purpose and approaches.

Element of a systems dynamics simulation model for requirements engineering,"The main aim of technology development and innovation is to deliver a new or improved product or service that will allow a company to maintain or increase its market share. This improvement in market share will only occur if the companies truly understand the customers' needs. This need is expressed as requirements that will form the basis of the product or service development and improvement specification. Care must also be taken not to over-specify the product or service since each of the selected requirements represents a cost to the company and eventually to the customer. The selection of the correct set of requirements are the first steps on the road to delivering a successful product or service. The elicitation of the requirements or specifications for a new or improved product or service forms part of the domain of requirements engineering. The requirements engineering domain is a complex, socio-technical system that is the result of the human element interacting with the technical element in the design and operation of the system of interest. This complexity could lead to the incorrect set of requirements being elicited if it is not understood and treated correctly. One of the methods for performing research within a complex, socio-technical system is by following a design science research approach to increase understanding of the problem domain. Previous research has identified elements that describes the problem domain within the context of the design science research approach. This paper proceeds to present a system dynamics model that can act as the investigating artefact, simulating the interaction between the identified elements with the aim of reducing requirements volatility.",Scribante N.; Pretorius L.; Benade S.,Conference Proceeding,"Towards Sustainable Technologies and Innovation - Proceedings of the 27th Annual Conference of the International Association for Management of Technology, IAMOT 2018",2018-04-25,University of Pretoria,Complex socio-technical systems ;  Design science research ;  Requirements engineering ;  System dynamics modelling ;  Technology and innovation management
Fuzzy Quality Function Deployment (fuzzy-QFD) applied to new defense product development,"The Quality Function Deployment (QFD) tool integrated with multicriteria decision-support methods has been widely applied to new product design, particularly with the support of fuzzy logic. The objective of this paper is to propose a conceptual model based on an integrated fuzzy-ANP-QFD approach to determine and prioritize engineering requirements of new defense products in light of future users' perspective. The research can be considered descriptive, applied, and methodological. Based on the results of the bibliographic and documentary review on the central themes of the research, a conceptual model was developed to determine and prioritize engineering requirements of new defense products, seeking to fill gaps identified during the literature review covering the period of 1987-2017. The paper emphasizes the opportunity to explore an integrated fuzzy-ANP-QFD approach in projects of new defense products since applications in this area were not identified during the literature review. The applicability of the model was demonstrated by an empirical case study having as experimental context the COBRA 2020 Project, a strategic initiative of the Brazilian Army. For this study, one of the new products to be developed within this Project was selected - a new thermal vision monocular. This work provides a conceptual model based on an integrated fuzzy-ANP-QFD approach for academicians and researchers to determine and prioritize engineering requirements of new defense products in a more efficient way compared with current practices. The research findings have the potential to be replicated in other projects of new defense products - at the Army Technology Center (CTEx) - and other military institutions dealing with research, development, and innovation (RD&I) activities in Brazil and abroad.",De Almeida M.; Silva Da Luz C.; De Andrade Martins G.,Conference Proceeding,"Towards Sustainable Technologies and Innovation - Proceedings of the 27th Annual Conference of the International Association for Management of Technology, IAMOT 2018",2018-04-25,Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro;Army Technology Center (CTEx),COBRA 2020 project ;  Defense ;  Fuzzy-ANP-QFD ;  New product design ;  Quality Function Deployment
A transformation in global business and engineering: The renaissance of multi-polarity in innovation,"The renaissance of non-Occidental cultural spheres recreates the historical normalcy of multi-polarity in engineering innovation. The purpose of this paper is to assess the impact of the renaissance of multi-polarity and the decline of the Occidental engineering innovation. Multi-polarity is a counterproposal of the implicit assumption of a continued Occidental dominance. This paper explicitly addresses the implicit assumption of continued Occidental dominance in the literature and research. It offers reasons for the reestablishment of multi-polarity. It contains a discussion of the ramifications of multi-polarity on engineering innovation. It assesses the implications of multi-polarity on the environment and health. Firms need to enhance their engineering innovation by a broader cognitive and cultural foundation.

Reshaping touch communication: An interdisciplinary research agenda,"This workshop aims to generate an interdisciplinary research agenda for digital touch communication that effectively integrates technological progress with robust investigations of the social nature and significance of digital touch. State-of-the-art touch-based technologies have the potential to supplement, extend or reconfigure how people communicate through reshaping existing touch practices and generating new capacities. Their possible impact on interpersonal intimacy, wellbeing, cultural norms, ways of knowing and power relations is far-reaching and under-researched. Few emerging devices and applications are embedded into everyday touch practices, limiting empirical exploration of the implications of digital touch technologies in everyday communication. There is, thus, a real need for methodological innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration to critically examine digital touch communication across social contexts and technological domains, to better understand the social consequences of how touch is digitally remediated. This agenda-setting workshop will bring together HCI researchers and designers with colleagues from sociology, media & communications, arts & design to address key research challenges and build the foundations for future collaborations.",Price S.; Mackley K.; Jewitt C.; Huisman G.; Petreca B.; Berthouze N.; Prattichizzo D.; Hayward V.,Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2018-04-20,UCL Knowledge Lab;Institut des Systèmes Intelligents et de Robotique;University College London;Universiteit Twente;Delft University of Technology;Università degli Studi di Siena,Affective haptics ;  Communication ;  Digital touch ;  Haptic ;  Methods ;  Sensory embodiment
Designing recipes for digital food futures,"Digital food technologies such as diet trackers, food sharing apps, and 'smart' kitchenware offer promising yet debatable food futures. While proponents suggest its potential to prompt efficient food lifestyles, critics highlight the underlying technosolutionism of digital food innovation and limitations related to health safety and data privacy. This workshop addresses both present and near-future digital food controversies and seeks to extend the existing body of Human-Food Interaction (HFI) research. Through scenarios and food-tech prototyping navigated by bespoke Digital Food Cards, we will unpack issues and suggest possible design approaches. We invite proposals from researchers, designers, and other practitioners interested in working towards a complex framework for future HFI research.",Ferdous H.; Dolejšová M.; Khot R.; Davis H.; Quitmeyer A.,Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2018-04-20,Swinburne University of Technology;University of Melbourne;National University of Singapore;RMIT University,Digital food cultures ;  Food design ;  Food sharing ;  Human-food interaction ;  Kitchenware ;  Quantified diets
(Un)Acceptable!?! – re-thinking the social acceptability of emerging technologies,"A central viewpoint to understanding the human aspects of interactive systems is the concept of technology acceptance. Actual, or imagined disapproval from other people can have a major impact on how information technological innovations are received, but HCI lacks comprehensive, up-to date, and actionable, articulations of “social acceptability”. The spread of information and communication technologies (ICT) into all aspects of our lives appears to have dramatically increased the range and scale of potential issues with social acceptance. This workshop brings together academics and practitioners to discuss what social acceptance and acceptability mean in the context of various emerging technologies and modern human-computer interaction. We aim to bring the concept of social acceptability in line with the current technology landscape, as well as to identify relevant research steps for making it more useful, actionable and researchable with well-operationalized metrics.",Koelle M.; Boll S.; Profita H.; Kane S.; Olsson T.; Williamson J.; Mitchell R.,Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2018-04-20,"Universität Oldenburg;University of Southern Denmark, Kolding;Tampere University;University of Glasgow;University of Colorado Boulder",Emerging Technologies ;  Social Acceptability ;  Social Computing ;  Technology Acceptance
The 2<sup>nd</sup> Workshop on hacking and making at time-bounded events: Current trends and next steps in research and event design,"Hackathons or Hackathon-style events, describe increasingly popular time-bounded intensive events across different fields and sectors. Often cited examples of hackathons include the demanding overnight competitive coding events, but there are many design variations for different audiences and with divergent aims. They offer a new form of collaboration by affording explicit, predictable, time-bounded spaces for interdependent work and engaging with new audiences. This one-day workshop will bring together researchers, experienced event organizers, and practitioners to share and discuss their practical experiences.

"Maker movements, do-it-yourself cultures and participatory design: Implications for HCI research","Falling costs and the wider availability of computational components, platforms and ecosystems have enabled the expansion of maker movements and DIY cultures. This can be considered as a form of democratization of technology systems design, in alignment with the aims of Participatory Design approaches. However, this landscape is constantly evolving, and long-term implications for the HCI community are far from clear. The organizers of this one-day workshop invite participants to present their case studies, experiences and perspectives on the topic with the goal of increasing understanding within this area of research.

General data protection regulation: An opportunity for the HCI community?,"With HCI, researchers conduct studies in interdisciplinary projects involving massive volume of data, artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities. Awareness of the responsibility is emerging as a key concern for the HCI community. This Community will be impacted by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [5], that will enter into force on the 25th of May 2018. From that date, each data controller and data processor will face an increase of its legal obligations (in particular its accountability) under certain conditions. The GDPR encourages the adoption of Soft Law mechanisms, approved by the national competent authority on data protection, to demonstrate the compliance to the Regulation. Approved Guidelines, Codes of Conducts, Labeling, Marks and Seals dedicated to data protection, as well as certification mechanisms are some of the options proposed by the GDPR. There may be discrepancies between the realities of HCI fieldwork and the formal process of obtaining Soft Law approval by Competent Authorities dedicated to data protection. Given these issues, it is important for researchers to reflect on legal and ethical encounters in HCI research as a community. This workshop will provide a forum for researchers to share experiences about Soft Law they have put in place to increase Trust, Transparency and Accountability among the shareholders. These discussions will be used to develop a white paper of practical Soft Law mechanisms (certification, labeling, marks, seals…) emerging in HCI research with the aim to demonstrate that the GDPR may be an opportunity for the HCI community.",Thelisson E.; Sharma K.; Salam H.; Dignum V.,Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2018-04-20,University of Fribourg;Delft University of Technology;Sorbonne Université;Université de Lausanne (UNIL),Codes of conduct ;  Design ;  Labeling ;  Privacy ;  Quality Standards ;  Responsible Innovation ;  Soft Law

Designing and evaluating mHealth interventions for vulnerable populations: A systematic review,"Diverse disciplines, including Human-Computer Interaction have explored how mobile health (mHealth) applications can transform healthcare and health promotion. Increasingly, research has explored how mHealth tools can promote healthy behaviors within vulnerable populations-groups that disproportionately experience barriers to wellness. We conducted a systematic review of 83 papers from diverse disciplines to characterize the design and impact of mHealth tools in low-socioeconomic (low-SES) and racial/ethnic minority individuals. Our findings highlight that the diversity within low-SES and racial/ethnic minority groups was not reflected in the populations studied. Most studies focused on improving the health of individuals, often neglecting factors at the community and society levels that influence health disparities. Moreover, few improvements in health outcomes were demonstrated. We further discuss factors that acted as barriers and facilitators of mHealth intervention adoption. Our findings highlight trends that can drive critically needed digital health innovations for vulnerable populations.",Stowell E.; Lyson M.; Saksono H.; Wurth R.; Jimison H.; Pavel M.; Parker A.,Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2018-04-20,Northeastern University;Tufts Medical Center,Ethnicity ;  MHealth ;  Minority ;  Race ;  Socioeconomic status ;  Systematic review ;  Vulnerable populations
Mapping machine learning advances from HCI research to reveal starting places for design innovation,"HCI has become particularly interested in using machine learning (ML) to improve user experience (UX). However, some design researchers claim that there is a lack of design innovation in envisioning how ML might improve UX. We investigate this claim by analyzing 2,494 related HCI research publications. Our review confirmed a lack of research integrating UX and ML. To help span this gap, we mined our corpus to generate a topic landscape, mapping out 7 clusters of ML technical capabilities within HCI. Among them, we identified 3 under-explored clusters that design researchers can dig in and create sensitizing concepts for. To help operationalize these technical design materials, our analysis then identified value channels through which the technical capabilities can provide value for users: self, context, optimal, and utility-capability. The clusters and the value channels collectively mark starting places for envisioning new ways for ML technology to improve people's lives.",Yang Q.; Banovic N.; Zimmerman J.,Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2018-04-20,School of Computer Science,Bibliometric ;  Data mining ;  Machine learning ;  Research transfer ;  Sensitizing concept ;  User experience
Bottom-up imaginaries: The cultural-technical practice of inventing regional advantage through IT R&D,"Recent HCI research on social creativity and bottom-up innovation has highlighted how concerted efforts by the government policy and business communities to develop innovation ecosystems are increasingly intertwined with IT research and development. We note that many such efforts focus on cultivating regional advantage [20] in the form of innovation hubs that are situated in and leverage distinct sociocultural histories and geographies. Cultivating regional advantage entails achieving broad consensus about what that region's advantage might be, that is, the construction of a regional advantage imaginary beyond the policies, IT supports, and practices to make it happen. Here, we document how an ongoing public debate among makers and manufacturers in Taiwan as a region-distinguished by direct engagement with design, fabrication, prototyping, and manufacturing processes-are proposing pathways toward a regional advantage that both reflects Taiwan's recent sociocultural and economic histories and also its near future aspirations.",Freeman G.; Bardzell S.; Bardzell J.,Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2018-04-20,University of Cincinnati;Indiana University Bloomington,Asia ;  Innovation ;  Internet of things ;  Iot ;  Makers ;  Making ;  Policy ;  Regional advantage ;  Taiwan
Infrastructuring the Solidarity economy: Unpacking strategies and tactics in designing social innovation,"Solidarity organizations in Europe are committed to building a more socially just society through a better configuration of democracy, politics and economy. In this paper, we describe our efforts to contribute to the sociopolitical designed innovation of solidarity movements through the establishment of a research lab embedded in, and operating within, the solidarity economy. We describe three cases that span the polarities of everyday and expert design, and contribute to the scaling out of social innovations. We use these cases to exemplify the strategies and tactics that emerge from the ongoing negotiation of'infrastructuring' work with solidarity organizations. Finally, we discuss how guerilla infrastructuring, designing coalitions, and spanning design polarities can contribute to HCI and design for social innovation more generally.",Vlachokyriakos V.; Crivellaro C.; Wright P.; Olivier P.,Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2018-04-20,Newcastle University,Social innovation ;  Social movements ;  Solidarity economy
[Un]breaking news: Design opportunities for enhancing collaboration in scientific media production,"Contemporary scientific media production requires a complex socio-technical infrastructure we call the ""Media Production Pipeline"" (MPP). Media professionals engage with researchers along the MPP to disseminate science news to the lay public. However, differing incentive structures and professional contexts frequently set researchers' values and needs at odds with those of media professionals, resulting in problematic or failed interactions. We ask the research question: what pain points in scientific media production afford opportunities for future HCI innovation? We then present a grounded theory analysis of 24 interviews with researchers and media professionals, yielding several key contributions. First, we describe two collaborative domains in scientific media production between research advocates and media outlets. Second, we characterize discrete technological gaps and pain points in both domains. Finally, we discuss implications for design and propose solutions from HCI areas like peer production, online communities, recommender systems, and online collaboration.",Smith C.; Wang X.; Karumur R.; Zhu H.,Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2018-04-20,University of Minnesota Twin Cities,Journalism ;  Mass media ;  Misinformation ;  News production ;  Online collaboration ;  Science communications
Everybody's hacking: Participation and the mainstreaming of Hackathons,"Hackathons have become a popular tool for bringing people together to imagine new possibilities for technology. Despite originating in technology communities, hackathons have now been widely adopted by a broad range of organisations. This mainstreaming of hackathons means they encompass a very different range of attendees and activities than they once did, to the extent that some events billed as hackathons may involve no coding at all. Given this shift away from production of code, they might instead be seen as an increasingly popular participatory design activity, from which designers and researchers in HCI can learn. Through fieldwork at six hackathons that targeted non-technical communities, we identify the types of activities and contributions that emerge through these events and the barriers and tensions that might exist. In doing so, we contribute a greater understanding of hackathons as a growing phenomenon and as a potential tool for participatory research.",Taylor N.; Clarke L.,Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2018-04-20,University of Dundee,Co-design ;  Hackathons ;  Innovation ;  Jams ;  Making ;  Participatory design
Social affordances at play: Game design toward socio-technical innovation,"In this paper we propose that game design strategies and theories can be useful tools for supporting the design of innovative socio-technical systems aimed at supporting social co-presence. We support this proposal with an annotated portfolio of a series of research prototype games that investigate sensor affordances and configurations to sustain and enhance social co-presence. We introduce relevant theory from game studies (the magic circle; the MDA (mechanics/dynamics/aesthetics framework)) to help ground and guide the use of game design in HCI practice. We conclude with recommendations for adopting game design as a supplementary research technique, with caveats about the limits of the approach.",Isbister K.; Segura E.; Melcer E.,Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2018-04-20,"University of California, Santa Cruz;New York University",Annotated portfolio ;  Game design ;  Magic circle ;  MDA framework ;  Research through design ;  Social affordances
Intelligent Autonomous Vehicles in digital supply chains: A framework for integrating innovations towards sustainable value networks,"The principal objective of this research is to provide a framework that captures the main software architecture elements for developing highly customised simulation tools that support the effective integration of Intelligent Autonomous Vehicles (IAVs) in sustainable supply networks, as an emerging field in the operations management agenda. To that end, the study's contribution is fourfold including: (i) a review of software simulation tools and platforms used in assessing the performance of IAVs interlinked with sustainability ramifications in supply chain (SC) ecosystems, (ii) an integrated software framework for monitoring and assessing the sustainability performance of SCs defined by the utilisation of innovative IAVs in operations, (iii) a translation of the proposed SC framework into a corresponding software application through a robust five-stage stepwise process, and (iv) a demonstration of the developed software tool through its application on the case of an IAV system operating in a customisable warehouse model. Our analysis highlights the flexibility resulting from a decentralised software management architecture, thus enabling the dynamic reconfiguration of a SC network. In addition, the developed pilot simulation tool can assist operations managers in capturing the operational needs of facilities and assessing the performance of IAV systems while considering sustainability parameters.",Bechtsis D.; Tsolakis N.; Vlachos D.; Srai J.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2018-04-20,University of Cambridge;Alexander Technological Educational Institute of Thessaloniki;Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,Digital supply chains ;  Innovation ;  Intelligent Autonomous Vehicles ;  Mobile industrial robots ;  Simulation software framework ;  Simulation tool ;  Sustainability

Understanding social and behavioral drivers and impacts of air quality sensor use,"Background Lower-cost air quality sensors (hundreds to thousands of dollars) are now available to individuals and communities. This technology is undergoing a rapid and fragmented evolution, resulting in sensors that have uncertain data quality, measure different air pollutants and possess a variety of design attributes. Why and how individuals and communities choose to use sensors is arguably influenced by social context. For example, community experiences with environmental exposures and health effects and related interactions with industry and government can affect trust in traditional air quality monitoring. To date, little social science research has been conducted to evaluate why or how sensors, and sensor data, are used by individuals and communities, or how the introduction of sensors changes the relationship between communities and air quality managers. Objectives This commentary uses a risk governance/responsible innovation framework to identify opportunities for interdisciplinary research that brings together social scientists with air quality researchers involved in developing, testing, and deploying sensors in communities. Discussion Potential areas for social science research include communities of sensor users; drivers for use of sensors and sensor data; behavioral, socio-political, and ethical implications of introducing sensors into communities; assessing methods for communicating sensor data; and harnessing crowdsourcing capabilities to analyze sensor data. Conclusions Social sciences can enhance understanding of perceptions, attitudes, behaviors, and other human factors that drive levels of engagement with and trust in different types of air quality data. New transdisciplinary research bridging social sciences, natural sciences, engineering, and design fields of study, and involving citizen scientists working with professionals from a variety of backgrounds, can increase our understanding of air sensor technology use and its impacts on air quality and public health.",Hubbell B.; Kaufman A.; Rivers L.; Schulte K.; Hagler G.; Clougherty J.; Cascio W.; Costa D.,Journal,Science of the Total Environment,2018-04-15,University of Oxford;United States Environmental Protection Agency;Drexel University;NC State University,Air pollution ;  Citizen science ;  Exposure ;  Monitoring ;  Social science

"No one size fits all - The development of a theory-driven intervention to increase in-hospital mobility: The ""wALK-FOR"" study","Background: There is growing evidence that mobility interventions can increase in-hospital mobility and prevent hospitalization-associated functional decline among older adults. However, implementing such interventions is challenging, mainly due to site-specific constraints and limited resources. The Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS 2.0) model has the potential to guide a sustainable, site-tailored mobility intervention. Thus, the aim of the current study is to demonstrate an adaptation process guided by the SEIPS 2.0 model to articulate site-specific, culturally based interventions to improve in-hospital mobility among older adults. Methods: Six consecutive phases addressed each of the model's elements in the research setting. Phase-1 aimed to determine a measurable outcome: steps/d, measured with accelerometers, associated with functional decline. Phase-2 included interviews with key persons in leadership positions in the hospital to explore organizational factors affecting in-hospital mobility. Phases-3 and 4 aimed to identify attitudes, knowledge, barriers, and current behaviors of medical staff (n = 116) and patients (n = 203) related to patient mobility. Phase-5 included four focus-groups with unit staff aimed at developing an action plan while adapting existing intervention strategies to site needs. Phase-6 relied on a steering committee that developed intervention-adaptation and implementation plans. Results: Nine hundred steps/d was defined as the intervention outcome. 40% of patients walked fewer than 900 steps/d regardless of capability. Assessing or promoting mobility did not exist as a separate task and thus was routinely overlooked. Several barriers to patients' mobility were identified, specifically limited knowledge of practical aspects of mobility. Consequently, staff adopted practical steps to address them. Nurses were designated to assess mobility, and nursing assistants to support mobility. Mobility was defined as a quality indicator to be documented in electronic medical records and closely supervised by hospital and unit management. Preliminary analyses of the ""Walk FOR"" protocol demonstrates its' ability to reduce barriers, to re-shape staff attitudes and knowledge, and to increase in-hospital mobility of older adults. Conclusions: The SEIPS-2.0 model can serve as a useful guide for implementing a site-tailored comprehensive mobility intervention. This process, which relies on local resources, may promise sustainable practice change that may support early effective rehabilitation and recovery.",Zisberg A.; Agmon M.; Gur-Yaish N.; Rand D.; Hayat Y.; Gil E.,Journal,BMC Geriatrics,2018-04-13,Clalit Health Services;Emek Medical Center;Tel Aviv University;University of Haifa,Functional decline ;  Hospitalization ;  Mobility ;  Older adults ;  Step count ;  Theory-driven intervention

Innovation in healthcare services - Creating a Combined Contingency Theory and Ecosystems Approach,"The purpose of this conceptual paper is to develop an analytical framework used for process development in healthcare services. Healthcare services imply a form of operations management demanding an adapted research approach. This study therefore highlights first in the introduction challenges of healthcare services as a reasoning of this study. It is a type of service that has high societal and therefore ethical concern, but at the same time needs to be carried out efficiently to economise service production resource use. Combined business and ethics concerns need to be balanced in this service supply system. In the literature review that is the bulk of this paper, first, particularities of the service industry processes are considered. This is followed by considering literature on contingency theory to consider the nature of the supply chain context of the healthcare service processes highlighting interdependencies and appropriate technology use. This developed view is then expanded to consider an ecosystems approach to encompass the environment expanding analyses to considering in balanced manner features of business, society and nature.

Model of urban water management towards water sensitive city: A literature review,"Nowadays, many cities are facing with complex issues such as climate change, social, economic, culture, and environmental problems, especially urban water. In other words, the city has to struggle with the challenge to make sure its sustainability in all aspects. This research focuses on how to ensure the city sustainability and resilience on urban water management. Many research were not only conducted in urban water management, but also in sustainability itself. Moreover, water sustainability shifts from urban water management into water sensitive city. This transition needs comprehensive aspects such as social, institutional dynamics, technical innovation, and local contents. Some literatures about model of urban water management and the transition towards water sensitivity had been reviewed in this study. This study proposed discussion about model of urban water management and the transition towards water sensitive city. Research findings suggest that there are many different models developed in urban water management, but they are not comprehensive yet and only few studies discuss about the transition towards water sensitive and resilience city. The drawbacks of previous research can identify and fulfill the gap of this study. Therefore, the paper contributes a general framework for the urban water management modelling studies.",Maftuhah D.; Anityasari M.; Sholihah M.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2018-04-10,Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember,
Critical operations capabilities in a high cost environment: A multiple case study,"Operations capabilities have been a popular research area for many years and several frameworks have been proposed in the literature. The current frameworks do not take specific contexts into consideration, for instance a high cost environment. This research gap is of particular interest since a manufacturing relocation process has been ongoing the last decades, leading to a huge amount of manufacturing being moved from high to low cost environments. The purpose of this study is to identify critical operations capabilities in a high cost environment. The two research questions were: What are the critical operations capabilities dimensions in a high cost environment? What are the critical operations capabilities in a high cost environment? A multiple case study was conducted and three Swedish manufacturing firms were selected. The study was based on the investigation of an existing framework of operations capabilities. The main dimensions of operations capabilities included in the framework were: cost, quality, delivery, flexibility, service, innovation and environment. Each of the dimensions included two or more operations capabilities. The findings confirmed the validity of the framework and its usefulness in a high cost environment and a new operations capability was revealed (employee flexibility).",Sansone C.; Hilletofth P.; Eriksson D.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2018-04-10,Jönköping University,
Cities as forces for good in the environment: Asystems approach,"Background: The various elements of infrastructure in cities and their systems of governance-for transport, buildings, solid waste management, sewerage and wastewater treatment, and so on-may be re-worked such that cities may become forces for good (CFG, for short) in the environment. The chapter is a study in the lessons learned from implementing and pursuing research into how a systems approach can be employed to meet the challenges of achieving CFGs. Methodology: Four case studies in CFG are presented within the framework of the methods and computational models of Systems Dynamics (SD): transport infrastructure for the Kanyakumari city-region in India, resource recovery from wastewater infrastructure in the city of Harare, Zimbabwe, environmental injustice in the handling of solid municipal wastes in, Democratic Republic of Congo, and improving the use of energy in university campus buildings in Bloemfontein, South Africa. Application/ Relevance to systems analysis: The chapter presents the successes and the difficulties of undertaking Applied Systems Analysis (ASA) in demanding urban contexts. Policy and practice implications: Policy for CFG derived from ASA often appears to be a matter of determining better technological innovations and engineering interventions in the infrastructure of cities, while practice often demands that infrastructure improvements follow from social and institutional improvements. Conclusion: The first of three conclusions is that combining the rigorous, logical, non-quantitative, more discursive and more incisive style of thinking derived from the humanities, particularly, social anthropology, with better computational modelling will yield better outcomes for ASA. Secondly, in a global context, cities-as opposed to nation-states-are increasingly becoming the locations and scale at which today's environmental, economic, and social ""problems"" might best be ""solved"". Third, and last, we conclude that South Africa, while it may not have a long tradition of problem-solving according to ASA, has for us emphasised (through our experience of the South African YSSPs) the limitations of an historical over-reliance on hard, quantitative methods of systems analysis.",Beck B.; Das D.; Thompson M.; Chirisa I.; Eromobor S.; Kubanza S.; Rewal T.; Burger E.,Book,Systems Analysis Approach for Complex Global Challenges,2018-04-09,"University of Zimbabwe;Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee;International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, Laxenburg;University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg;Imperial College London;Central University of Technology, Free State",
Indicators for monitoring undergraduate STEM education,"Science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) professionals generate a stream of scientific discoveries and technological innovations that fuel job creation and national economic growth. Ensuring a robust supply of these professionals is critical for sustaining growth and creating jobs growth at a time of intense global competition. Undergraduate STEM education prepares the STEM professionals of today and those of tomorrow, while also helping all students develop knowledge and skills they can draw on in a variety of occupations and as individual citizens. However, many capable students intending to major in STEM later switch to another field or drop out of higher education altogether, partly because of documented weaknesses in STEM teaching, learning and student supports. Improving undergraduate STEM education to address these weaknesses is a national imperative. Many initiatives are now underway to improve the quality of undergraduate STEM teaching and learning. Some focus on the national level, others involve multi-institution collaborations, and others take place on individual campuses. At present, however, policymakers and the public do not know whether these various initiatives are accomplishing their goals and leading to nationwide improvement in undergraduate STEM education. Indicators for Monitoring Undergraduate STEM Education outlines a framework and a set of indicators that document the status and quality of undergraduate STEM education at the national level over multiple years. It also indicates areas where additional research is needed in order to develop appropriate measures. This publication will be valuable to government agencies that make investments in higher education, institutions of higher education, private funders of higher education programs, and industry stakeholders. It will also be of interest to researchers who study higher education.",Rosenberg M.; Hilton M.; Dibner K.,Book,Indicators for Monitoring Undergraduate STEM Education,2018-04-08,Florida International University,
Pipeline crack detection using mathematical morphological operator,"A pipeline crack is a major hazard to any type of liquid transportation. Oil industry depends mainly on human detection of these cracks, which leads to many problems from health to environment disaster. To detect a crack, pipelines' inner layers are X-rayed, and these X-rays were later manually evaluated for cracks and holes. This technique evolves lot of time and resources. This proposed research work helps to diminish this problem by analyzing the cracks and holes through a computerized solution. A pipeline with crack is analyzed using image analysis and processing which comprises of various pattern recognition techniques. Image analysis and processing is one of the most powerful innovations in today's world. It brings all kinds of pattern recognition together and solves the problem of data identification and misuse of data. This is achieved by applying the method of pattern analysis and recognition. As a result, this technique of image analysis and processing is used to detect the holes and cracks which occur in a pipeline that carries any type of liquids and gases. This paradigm helps in environmental safety. As in the pipeline industry there are many man-made equipments and methods, computer application to carry out these process is lacking. To make a shift over to the computerized image recognition, high-frequency filter (HFF) with Gate Turn off thyristor (GTO) using unsupervised-based learning algorithm is implemented. Mathematical morphological operator and edge detection principles are used for image evaluation. Initially a digital camera with fiber optic cable is passed inside a pipeline to capture the cracked images. These images are converted as raster images and stored as bits. Later, these images are processed to view for hidden points using unsupervised cluster algorithm; after evaluating the hidden points, the crack has to be measured for its length and to identify the location where it occurs and this is achieved by developing mathematical morphological operator. Images are always not clear, so the dataset formed is always unclear; in order to smooth the images, the edge detection principle is applied. The captured images are read as pixel groups, after converting into raster images. If the pixels grouped as clusters are clear with no zero bit values, it denotes that the pipeline is without any crack else even a small relapse in any one of the pixel will make the image vague. The blurred picture denotes that there is a defect in the pipeline. This helps to locate the image with defect, which is rectified and thus it results in an effective, defect-free passage that will carry any type of liquid or gas. The extraction of hidden patterns from a large quantity of data recognition activities seems to be a major conflict in image detection. Usually, the size of a pipeline is 22 m; in order to avoid the problem of large data, the length to capture an image can be reduced to 10 m and later the rest. The safety of the environment and the manual operator is very important during the transportation of any substance in a pipeline; this major security concern has made image detection to become a popular component in the area of image analysis and processing. In traditional manual detection systems, the manual operator needs to spend much time in analyzing the data and also it generates high false data rates. There is an urgent need for effective and efficient methods to discover both the unknown and unexpected novel image display over a pipeline network from those that are extremely large in size and high in dimensionality and complexity. So the pattern recognition-based image analysis detection systems have been chosen which are more precise and require less manual processing time and input from human experts. This research focuses on solving the issues in image detection communities that can help the system operator to make processing, classification, labeling of data and to mitigate the outcome of image data. The system administrator finds it difficult to preprocess the data. Even though it has been done successfully, the overwhelming output of the images makes the task a failure and even sometimes images go unidentified. To overcome this situation, frequent updating of data is needed. In order to reduce the workload of the administrator, four major image analysis and processing techniques involving pattern recognition task have been introduced. Image detection datasets have been used in this research, and the proposed algorithms will be implemented in MATLAB. In this research, for classification of network data, several existing algorithms like Kohonen-cluster algorithm, Canny's edge detection algorithm, and mathematical morphological operator algorithm for the simulation of images are proposed. The crack is measured using mathematical morphological operator. Mathematical morphology is evaluated using the concept of geometric measurements. Set theory is applied to evaluate morphological-based geometric measurements. An important technical goal is to provide sufficient information so that the readers can apprehend and possibly implement the technique that has been derived. The result of this study will build a system, for identifying the defects in an oil pipe, by matching to an image database. This system can be implemented or replaced with the existing manual one. Need of this topic: Engineers pursuing mechanical stream and who would like to have a career from normal mechanical to oil pipeline can refer the topic through this book for their career enhancement. The chapters on erosion, corrosion, and dilation will help them to make a more effective study on cracks and holes which can be applied through robotics. This book will focus more on detecting the cluster cracks that are neglected during an inspection of an oil pipeline. This concept of detecting a hole or a crack can be applied to any type of pipeline that is going to transport any type of substances. The topic of the book can be the same or it can be altered according to the needed definition of the engineering society. The opportunity to write these chapters will help to learn more about the mathematical operators to detect a clustered crack.",Prema Kirubakaran A.; Murali Krishna I.,Book,Knowledge Computing and its Applications: Knowledge Computing in Specific Domains,2018-04-03,Indian Institute of Technology Madras;Indian Space Research Organisation;Annai Veilankanni's College for Women (Arts and Science),
Domain framework for implementation of open IoT ecosystems,"The current Internet-of-things (IoT) hype, pushed by the unprecedented rate of the technological enablers’ innovation, is threatening to leave behind some major, not so obvious, unresolved issues. IoT platforms will extend existing enterprise information systems (EIS) infrastructures to encompass cross-domain sensing and actuating capabilities, thus introducing additional complexity and major risks to the implementation. Furthermore, IoT platforms are typically driven by models of the trivial complexity; they support very simple data structures and almost no business logic implementation. Finally, IoT systems are today managed centrally, which often means less openness, less flexibility and greater change management costs. In this article, we provide the overview of the scientific disciplines which could contribute to the resolution of the IoT implementation problem, namely requirements engineering, change management/continuous improvement, model-based systems engineering, system architecture design, interoperability and policy and regulatory aspects. Then, we identify the challenges of these contributions in the context of IoT and finally make an attempt to identify research directions which could have a significant impact. The discussion of the challenges and opportunities is illustrated by the proposed domain framework for implementation of open IoT ecosystems.",Zdravković M.; Zdravković J.; Aubry A.; Moalla N.; Guedria W.; Sarraipa J.,Journal,International Journal of Production Research,2018-04-03,Décision et Information Pour les Systèmes de Production;Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology;CRAN Centre de Recherche en Automatique de Nancy;University of Niš;Stockholms universitet;Instituto de Desenvolvimento de Novas Tecnologias,Internet of things ;  interoperability ;  maturity assessment ;  model-based systems engineering ;  multi-agent systems ;  requirements engineering
X-pinch plasma generation testing for neutron source development and nuclear fusion,"Nuclear fusion is a sought-out technology in which two light elements are fused together to create a heavier element and releases energy. Two primary nuclear fusion technologies are being researched today: magnetic and inertial confinement. However, a new type of nuclear fusion technology is currently being research: multi-pinch plasma beams. At the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, there is research on multi-pinch plasma beam technology as an alternative to nuclear fusion. The objective is to intersect two plasma arcs at the center of the chamber. This is a precursor of nuclear fusion using multi-pinch. The innovation portion of the students' work is the miniaturization of this concept using high energy electrical DC pulses. The experiment achieved the temperature of 2300 K at the intersection. In comparison to the simulation data, the temperature from the simulation is 7000 K at the intersection. Additionally, energy harvesting devices, both photovoltaics and a thermoelectric generator, were placed in the chamber to observe the viable energy extraction.",Gabbar H.; Stoute C.; Bondarenko D.; Tarsitano N.; Rihem A.; Sirakov S.; Jani S.; Menashi S.,Journal,Energies,2018-04-01,Ontario Tech University,Engineering design of fusion reactor ;  Fusion energy ;  Plasma generation ;  X-pinch
Technology transfer projects in the UK: An analysis of university - Industry collaboration,"This article examines how technology transfer has operated in university-company projects undertaken in small to medium sized enterprises via the UK Knowledge Transfer Partnership scheme. It adopts a qualitative case study approach, focusing on three companies drawn from an initial review of fourteen technology transfer projects. This provides the foundation for the development of a model of 12 key factors that underpinned successful outcomes in these projects. The fourteen projects are reviewed in terms of their impact on either process change, service improvement or product development, drawing upon the post-project assessments of the funding body and the developed model. Findings suggest that using new technology to innovate internal processes and services is likely to prove more successful than projects focusing on new product development.

What Drives Engineering Students To Be Entrepreneurs? Evidence of Validity for an Entrepreneurial Motivation Scale,"Background: Educators and policymakers are increasingly interested in making entrepreneurship education accessible to engineering students given engineers' potential contributions to innovation and the economy. However, what motivates engineering students to choose entrepreneurial careers and how this could be influenced through education have not been fully explored in the literature. Purpose: The study develops and tests an entrepreneurial motivation scale for engineering students. It required providing initial evidence of validity for the scale based on guidelines for developing educational and psychological tests. Design/Method: Following a comprehensive literature review, we chose to modify an existing scale and administer it to engineering students. Here we present two sources of evidence of validity for examining how entrepreneurial motivation relates to variables commonly used to measure the impact of entrepreneurship education. They were developed by examining factor structure and psychometric properties as well as conducting mediation analysis. Results: Data obtained from 460 engineering students supported three factors underlying the construct of entrepreneurial motivation: Motivation for Creation and Solution (MCS), Motivation for Personal Interests (MPS), and Managerial Motivation (MM). MCS and MM effectively explained intention to become an entrepreneur with mediation effects of venturing and technology self-efficacy. Conclusion: These findings resulted in a more parsimonious categorization of factors underlying the construct of entrepreneurial motivation than identified in prior studies, providing a foundational understanding of entrepreneurial motivation among engineering students. The results can be useful in assessment, research, and/or policy decisions related to delivering entrepreneurship education to engineering students.",Yi S.; Duval-Couetil N.,Journal,Journal of Engineering Education,2018-04-01,Purdue University,entrepreneurship ;  factor analysis ;  motivation ;  structural equation modeling ;  validity

"Remote biomonitoring of temperatures in mothers and newborns: Design, development and testing of a wearable sensor device in a tertiary-care hospital in southern India","Objective Newer technologies such as wearables, sensors, mobile telephony and computing offer opportunities to monitor vital physiological parameters and tackle healthcare problems, thereby improving access and quality of care. We describe the design, development and testing of a wearable sensor device for remote biomonitoring of body temperatures in mothers and newborns in southern India. Methods Based on client needs and technological requirements, a wearable sensor device was designed and developed using principles of 'social innovation' design. The device underwent multiple iterations in product design and engineering based on user feedback, and then following preclinical testing, a techno-feasibility study and clinical trial were undertaken in a tertiary-care teaching hospital in Bangalore, India. Clinical trial phases I and IIa for evaluation of safety and efficacy were undertaken in the following sequence: 7 healthy adult volunteers; 18 healthy mothers; 3 healthy babies; 10 stable babies in the neonatal care intensive unit and 1 baby with morbidities. Time-stamped skin temperature readings obtained at 5 min intervals over a 1-hour period from the device secured on upper arms of mothers and abdomen of neonates were compared against readings from thermometers used routinely in clinical practice. Results Devices were comfortably secured on to adults and neonates, and data were efficiently transmitted via the gateway device for secure storage and retrieval for analysis. The mean skin temperatures in mothers were lower than the axillary temperatures by 2°C; and in newborns, there was a precision of -0.5°C relative to axillary measurements. While occasional minimal adverse events were noted in healthy volunteers, no adverse events were noted in mothers or neonates. Conclusions This proof-of-concept study shows that this device is promising in terms of feasibility, safety and accuracy (with appropriate calibration) with potential for further refinements in device accuracy and pursuit of further phases of clinical research for improved maternal and neonatal health.",Mony P.; Thankachan P.; Bhat S.; Rao S.; Washington M.; Antony S.; Thomas A.; Nagarajarao S.; Rao H.; Amrutur B.,Journal,BMJ Innovations,2018-04-01,St. John's National Academy Of Health Sciences India;Indian Institute of Science,mother ;  newborn ;  remote monitoring ;  vital signs ;  wireless sensors

Managerial preparation of engineers with eyes of students,"The development of the economy at the present stage causes an increase in the requirements for the management training of future engineers. A graduate of engineering specialty should possess a complex of managerial skills and skills related to the management of the process of creation and operation of new products and systems, participation in various projects and effective communications. The purpose of the study is to study the attitude of graduates of engineering specialties to managerial skills and skills in the professional activities of an engineer. The research was carried out using the method of questioning graduates of management specialties of the University of Minin in 2016-2017. The study made it possible to assess the graduates' degree of mastery of managerial skills in the course of training at a university, to identify areas of managerial training, to which graduates of engineering specialties are interested, to describe the motives for mastering managerial skills and skills after graduation, to determine priority forms of additional managerial training from the positions of graduates of managerial specialties. Conclusions are drawn due to the need to form a comprehensive understanding of the specifics of managerial activities within the engineering profession, the high demand for managerial disciplines related to project management, quality management and innovation, the interest of graduates in formal ways of obtaining additional managerial training.

Certus: an organizational effort towards research-based innovation in software verification and validation,"What is gratifying to a software engineering researcher? Three of many possible answers to this question are (a) the intellectual exercise in developing/disseminating approaches that address emerging and existing challenges, (b) recognition from impact in a community of researchers and (c) widespread use of novel ideas, including software, in the society at large leading to enhancement of human ability and job creation. A culmination of these sources requires an organizational effort. This article presents a detailed account of a research-based innovation centre, Certus, to facilitate such a culmination for software engineering researchers. Certus has established a body of knowledge, methods and tools for the validation and verification of software systems in the Norwegian private and public sector. Certus works in close cooperation with five founding user partners and is hosted by the Simula Research Laboratory. We present the organizational structure of Certus and describe how Certus’s life and health is planned and evaluated on a regular basis as a research-based innovation centre. We expound two successful collaborations, with (a) the private sector entity Cisco systems, Norway and (b) the public sector entity the Norwegian Customs and Excise. We hope that this document will serve as a basis to encourage national/international funding schemes to create call for proposals for long-term research-based innovation centres.

Theoretical model for the bond–slip relationship between ribbed steel bars and confined concrete,"This paper conducts a theoretical research into bond–slip relationship between ribbed steel bars and concrete. According to whether the concrete is cracked or not, the ascending part of the bond–slip curve is divided into two sections which are calculated by two different mechanical models. Based on the wedging action mechanism, the slip is introduced as displacement boundary conditions into the model, which is the main innovation of this study. The boundary conditions of the model are changed by the changing slip, so the bond stress values corresponding to all levels of slip are obtained. According to the rebar geometrical parameters specified in National Standard GB1499-2007, the spacing of the adjacent ribs is fitted as a linear function of the rebar diameter. Then characteristic slip with the rib spacing as the main parameter is adopted in this study. Also, a negative exponential function is proposed for the descending part of the bond–slip curve. Specially, parameters of slipping path are therefore suggested for engineering applications. Comparison between calculated values and test results shows that the theoretical model can reasonably predict the local bonding problems with different steel bar diameters and concrete strength grades.",Zhao W.; Zhu B.,Journal,Structural Concrete,2018-04-01,"China University of Mining & Technology, Beijing;China Electric Power Research Institute",bond–slip ;  elasticity ;  reinforced concrete ;  ribbed bars ;  wedging action

Quantifying the Impact of Scientific Research on Agriculture,"With the growing importance of science and innovation for farming, the scope for summary monetary estimates of the impact of agricultural research on productivity suggests internal rates of return of between 7 and 15 per cent, and time lags in maximum impact of around nine years. However, the extent to which the transmission process can be regarded as a ‘black box’ for econometric purposes is considered increasingly inappropriate, since the intermediate steps between research and the impacts of resulting technology adoption are increasingly complex and involve growing numbers of actors, actions and a wider set of policy objectives. Significant difficulties are encountered in quantifying research impacts, including gaps in data for dependent and explanatory variables. New features of the agricultural sector also need to be accounted for, which relate to the role of knowledge engineering, globalisation and the establishment of new impact pathways which are affecting the speed of transmission of innovations. Public support for agricultural research funding is generally justified but returns are not sufficiently high, thus requiring careful reflection on priorities for research investment. Combined use of qualitative and quantitative evaluation approaches can be complementary and more effective than relying on either alone.",Viaggi D.,Journal,EuroChoices,2018-04-01,Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna,
"China's science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) research environment: A snapshot","In keeping with China's President Xi Jinping's 'Chinese Dream,' China has set a goal of becoming a world-class innovator by 2050. China's higher education Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) research environment will play a pivotal role in influencing whether China is successful in transitioning from a manufacturing-based economy to an innovation-driven, knowledge-based economy. Past studies on China's research environment have been primarily qualitative in nature or based on anecdotal evidence. In this study, we surveyed STEM faculty from China's top 25 universities to get a clearer understanding of how faculty members view China's overall research environment. We received 731 completed survey responses, 17% of which were from individuals who received terminal degrees from abroad and 83% of which were from individuals who received terminal degrees from domestic institutions of higher education. We present results on why returnees decided to study abroad, returnees' decisions to return to China, and differences in perceptions between returnees and domestic degree holders on the advantages of having a foreign degree. The top five challenges to China's research environment identified by survey respondents were: A promotion of short-term thinking and instant success (37% of all respondents); research funding (33%); too much bureaucratic or governmental intervention (31%); the evaluation system (27%); and a reliance on human relations (26%). Results indicated that while China has clearly made strides in its higher education system, there are numerous challenges that must be overcome before China can hope to effectively produce the kinds of innovative thinkers that are required if it is to achieve its ambitious goals. We also raise questions about the current direction of education and inquiry in China, particularly indications that government policy is turning inward, away from openness that is central to innovative thinking.",Han X.; Appelbaum R.,Journal,PLoS ONE,2018-04-01,"Science and Technology Policy Institute;University of California, Santa Barbara",
Innovative analysis of a buried operating pipeline subjected to strike-slip fault movement,"Earthquake induced Permanent Ground Deformation (PGD), such as landslides, lateral spreading due to liquefaction and faulting, seriously threaten the safety of buried pipelines, highlighting the need to accurately evaluate their seismic performance within the engineering design practice. Over the last decades, this problem has been addressed numerically using the simplistic beam on Winkler foundation and the more complex continuum model. While the former is unable to model the realistic soil-pipeline interaction for large scale deformations and to capture the pipeline local instabilities, the latter presents significant disadvantages in terms of elevated computational demands and required engineering expertise. This paper presents a parametric analysis of a buried pipeline crossing a strike-slip fault, using the continuum modelling approach, where both soil and pipe contact surfaces are meshed with a similar mesh size guaranteeing solution convergence. Moreover, the introduced submodeling technique allows to focus with a finer mesh on the limited part of the model susceptible to local buckling, permitting to accurately evaluate the critical fault displacement corresponding to this performance limit state. To optimize computational costs, each end of a limited pipe segment crossing the fault is suitably connected to an equivalent-boundary spring, representing the interaction with the rest of the soil-pipeline system. The seismic performance of the buried pipeline is evaluated in function of different critical parameters, such as the fault inclination angle and the pipe internal pressure. The obtained numerical results are accurately compared with data reported in recent research publications and analytical solutions, giving a better insight into the mechanical behaviour of soil-pipeline system under strike-slip faulting. In conclusion, the proposed modelling procedure, including the submodeling technique, can be suitably used to accurately and efficiently analyse the seismic performance of buried pipelines subjected to similar PGD.",Banushi G.; Squeglia N.; Thiele K.,Journal,Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering,2018-04-01,Università di Pisa;Technische Universität Braunschweig,
A project management issue of new technology developments: A case study on lack of human factors’ attention in human–robot interaction,"The complexity of today’s sociotechnical systems has prompted researchers and practitioners to advocate new holistic approaches to safety. However, many engineering standards, methods and processes for addressing technical, human and organizational factors do not fully reflect this. This article investigates known project management challenges and how they can explain the lack of attention to human factors issues in the design and development of new technology. As such, the work contributes to a research stream investigating why the human factors discipline is repeatedly marginalized in engineering projects. This article reports on findings from a case study – a research and innovation project developing technology and concepts for human–robot collaboration.

Climbing plants: attachment adaptations and bioinspired innovations,"Climbing plants have unique adaptations to enable them to compete for sunlight, for which they invest minimal resources for vertical growth. Indeed, their stems bear relatively little weight, as they traverse their host substrates skyward. Climbers possess high tensile strength and flexibility, which allows them to utilize natural and manmade structures for support and growth. The climbing strategies of plants have intrigued scientists for centuries, yet our understanding about biochemical adaptations and their molecular undergirding is still in the early stages of research. Nonetheless, recent discoveries are promising, not only from a basic knowledge perspective, but also for bioinspired product development. Several adaptations, including nanoparticle and adhesive production will be reviewed, as well as practical translation of these adaptations to commercial applications. We will review the botanical literature on the modes of adaptation to climb, as well as specialized organs—and cellular innovations. Finally, recent molecular and biochemical data will be reviewed to assess the future needs and new directions for potential practical products that may be bioinspired by climbing plants.",Burris J.; Lenaghan S.; Stewart C.,Journal,Plant Cell Reports,2018-04-01,"Tickle College of Engineering;The University of Tennessee, Knoxville",Adhesion ;  Biomimicry ;  Engineering ;  Hooks ;  Nanoparticles ;  Robotics ;  Tendrils
Reflections on work as done (WAD) and work as imagined (WAI) in an emergency response organization: A study on firefighters training exercises,"Emergency response organizations need to be resilient to cope with escalating events resulting from dynamic, unexpected, or complex situations. In Brazil, the Firefighter Corps are military hierarchal organizations with a culture based on fixed structures, well defined norms and procedures. These push against innovations which are necessary to be resilient. This research describes how firefighter captains in the 30–35-year age range managed an emergency response escalation in light of standard operating procedures (SOPs) during a training exercise. The study used ethnographic methods to find and discuss gaps between the instructions and the activities carried out during the exercise, highlighting the differences between work as done (WAD) and work as imagined (WAI), as it was instantiated in the SOP prescriptions. The aim was to produce reflections on WAI and WAD as a way to raise awareness of the need for a cultural change toward resilience in firefighter organizations. This was achieved through firefighter engagement with a comprehensive visualization of the analysis results which afforded easy interaction between the experts, the data, and the researchers.",Carvalho P.; Righi A.; Huber G.; Lemos C.; Jatoba A.; Gomes J.,Journal,Applied Ergonomics,2018-04-01,Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz;Comissão Nacional de Energia Nuclear Rio de Janeiro;Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,Emergency response ;  Resilience engineering ;  Simulation exercises ;  WAI and WAD
The human resource dimension of science-based technology transfer: lessons from Russian RTOs and innovative enterprises,"This study addresses ‘science-based’ technology transfer by research and technology organizations (RTO) whose mission is to combine intramural R&D and technology extension for industrial application. The paper is based on a unique database of Russian RTOs relating their science-based activity to technology transfer performance, on the one hand, and the contribution of R&D personnel sourced from universities to R&D output, on the other. The outcomes suggest a positive relationship between RTO scientific publication and technology transfer activity. Moreover, science-based outputs are contributed mostly by researchers coming to RTOs from academia. Such results are important to countries like Russia with many RTOs that play an important intermediary role between science and technological innovation. The study offers more fine-grained results regarding the differential impact of various types of academic personnel inflows in public versus private RTOs.",Zaichenko S.,Journal,Journal of Technology Transfer,2018-04-01,HSE University,Innovation ;  R&D human resources ;  Research and technology organizations ;  RTOs ;  Russia ;  Science-based regime ;  Technology transfer
The impact of convergence between science and technology on innovation,"This study investigates the effects of convergence of science and technology on innovation impact, specifically how convergence helps R&D organizations to apply scientific knowledge to their R&D activities. In addition to direct effects of convergence, we address the moderating effects of scientific capacity, knowledge spillover, and knowledge maturity from the knowledge side. The empirical analysis, which employs a zero inflated negative binomial regression model uses data on 2074 patents granted to US organizations from the pharmaceutical industry. The results show that an increase in the proportion of scientific knowledge in convergence has a positive and curvilinear relationship with innovation impact. Also, we find that the organization’s scientific capacity, regional scientific knowledge spillover, and knowledge maturity positively moderate the relationship between convergence and innovation impact. Our findings underline the importance of convergence between science and technology as well as provide implications on how to improve the outcome of an organization’s research and development process.",Lee C.; Park G.; Kang J.,Journal,Journal of Technology Transfer,2018-04-01,Samsung SDS;Seoul National University,Convergence ;  Innovation ;  Knowledge ;  R&D ;  Science ;  Technology

Ecologically sustainable technologies for management of highland banana pests in East and Central Africa,"East African highland cooking banana (EAHB; AAA-EA) is one of the most important staple and cash crops in the Great Lakes region of Eastern and Central Africa (ECA). The region has countries with the highest per capita consumption of bananas in the world. Most bananas are planted in low-input, small-scale systems for local markets and household consumption. Farmers use numerous cultivars in different cropping associations under diverse ecological conditions and under different levels of management. They face a range of constraints including pests, diseases, declining soil fertility and increasing costs of inputs. The banana weevil and root-parasitic nematodes are the major pests of bananas in ECA. Available technologies for the control of these pests include cultural control, clean planting material, biological control and chemical control which are either costly, labour intensive or ecologically unsustainable. Recent research efforts have provided innovations for the management of the pests, including conventional breeding, somaclonal selection, development of resistant banana cultivars through genetic engineering, microbial agents, pheromone trapping enhanced by integrating with microbial agents and use of botanicals. This article provides a review of the current banana pest management innovations which are ecologically sustainable and discusses the role of integrating the different pest management options into control packages for increased impact on pest populations and yield.

A Patent Analysis of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) Innovations for Electrical Systems,"The use of reliability assessment and prediction in product design, manufacture, and operation has been an evolutionary process. Physics-based modeling and root-cause analysis of failure sites, failure modes, and failure mechanisms have proven to be effective in the prevention and fault detection of product failures over the past decades. Nevertheless, prognostics and health management (PHM) is now the focus of recent activity as noted by the amount of books, articles, and patents. This three-part review aims to give a comprehensive overview of PHM patents from three aspects: PHM for electrical systems, PHM for mechanical systems, and general PHM methodologies. This series of survey papers reviews the history of PHM research in industry and its current status based on U.S. patents from 2000 to 2015; discusses the application of PHM in the design, manufacture, and deployment of equipment in various industries; and presents some of the key research questions which remain to be addressed, with particular attention on the results reported in the last decade.

Experiments in interdisciplinarity: Responsible research and innovation and the public good,"In Europe, responsible research and innovation (RRI) has emerged as a science policy measure that demands the early integration of a broad range of social actors and perspectives into research and development (R&D). More collaboration of the social sciences and humanities (SSH) with science and engineering appears within this policy framework as a crucial element that will enable better technological development. However, RRI is new to both natural scientists and SSH scholars, and interdisciplinary collaborations are challenging for many reasons. In this paper, we discuss these challenges while suggesting that what RRI can be in a particular project is not a given but remains an empirical question. Natural scientists and SSH scholars need to coresearch RRI in an experimental mode.",Delgado A.; Åm H.,Journal,PLoS Biology,2018-03-26,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet;Universitetet i Oslo,

"Academic scientists with military funding - who are they, what are their working practices, and are they engaged in technology commercialization","Military investments in academic Research & Development (R&D) have a significant impact on technological innovation and the competitiveness of the U.S. firms. This chapter reports key insights from a national survey of academic scientists based at the U.S. research universities. We found that only 12.8% of scientists in a representative sample of 1,526 academic scientists received Department of Defense (DoD) funding and can characterize this unique group of scientists as follows. This DoD funding is likely originating from the DoD SBIR program. First, scientists that are tenured, older, and affiliated with primarily selected engineering departments have higher odds of receiving military R&D funding. Second, scientists funded by the military spent less time doing research alone, with scientists in other U.S. universities and with scientists in other countries and more time doing research with their own research group and industrial firms, than their peers without military funding. Third, academic scientists sponsored by military funds have significantly higher odds of co-patenting a technology with industry and commercializing novel technologies with industry personnel than scientists without military funding. Adopting an open innovation perspective, we contrast the outcomes of a DoD policy of shielded innovation with that of a shared innovation policy for the development and commercialization of dual-use technologies.",Libaers D.,Book,World Scientific Reference On Innovation,2018-03-20,Muma College of Business,Department of defense funding ;  Dual-use technologies ;  Technology commercialization
Interim report of the committee on a strategic plan for U.S. Burning Plasma Research,"In January 2003, President George W. Bush announced that the United States would begin negotiations to join the ITER project and noted that ""if successful, ITER would create the first fusion device capable of producing thermal energy comparable to the output of a power plant, making commercially viable fusion power available as soon as 2050."" The United States and the other ITER members are now constructing ITER with the aim to demonstrate that magnetically confined plasmas can produce more fusion power than the power needed to sustain the plasma. This is a critical step towards producing and delivering electricity from fusion energy. Since the international establishment of the ITER project, ITER's construction schedule has slipped and ITER's costs have increased significantly, leading to questions about whether the United States should continue its commitment to participate in ITER. This study will advise how to best advance the fusion energy sciences in the United States given developments in the field, the specific international investments in fusion science and technology, and the priorities for the next ten years developed by the community and the Office of Fusion Energy Sciences (FES) that were recently reported to Congress. It will address the scientific justification and needs for strengthening the foundations for realizing fusion energy given a potential choice of U.S. participation or not in the ITER project, and develops future scenarios in either case. This interim report assesses the current status of U.S. fusion research and of the importance of burning plasma research to the development of fusion energy as well as to plasma science and other science and engineering disciplines. The final report will present strategies that incorporate continued progress toward a burning plasma experiment and a focus on innovation.",,Book,Interim Report of the Committee on a Strategic Plan for U.S. Burning Plasma Research,2018-03-19,,
Manufacture of mold of polymeric composite water pipe reinforced charcoal,"In general, household wastewater pipelines currently use thermoplastic pipes of Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC). This material is known to be not high heat resistant, contains hazardous chemicals (toxins), relatively inhospitable, and relatively more expensive. Therefore, researchers make innovations utilizing natural materials in the form of wood charcoal as the basic material of making the water pipe. Making this pipe requires a simple mold design that can be worked in the scale of household and intermediate industries. This research aims to produce water pipe mold with simple design, easy to do, and making time relatively short. Some considerations for molding materials are weight of mold, ease of raw material, strong, sturdy, and able to cast. Pipe molds are grouped into 4 (four) main parts, including: outer diameter pipe molding, pipe inside diameter, pipe holder, and pipe alignment control. Some materials have been tested as raw materials for outer diameter of pipes, such as wood, iron / steel, cement, and thermoset. The best results are obtained on thermoset material, where the process of disassembling is easier and the resulting mold weight is relatively lighter. For the inside diameter of the pipe is used stainless steel, because in addition to be resistant to chemical processes that occur, in this part of the mold must hold the press load due to shrinkage of raw materials of the pipe during the process of hardening (polymerization). Therefore, it needs high pressure resistant material and does not blend with the raw material of the pipe. The base of the mold is made of stainless steel material because it must be resistant to corrosion due to chemical processes. As for the adjustment of the pipe is made of ST 37 carbon steel, because its function is only as a regulator of the alignment of the pipe structure.",Zulfikar.; Misdawati M.; Idris M.; Nasution F.; Harahap U.; Simanjuntak R.; Jufrizal J.; Pranoto S.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,2018-03-19,Universitas Medan Area;Institut Teknologi Medan;Sekolah Tinggi Teknologi Pekanbaru;Universitas Muhammaddiyah Sumatera Utara;Universitas Al Azhar Medan;Sekolah Tinggi Teknik Harapan,

Communication of creativeness in business media,"Creativity has been traditionally associated and even identified with artistry. However, it is being perceived as an impetus for the development of leadership and technologies innovation, and is characteristic of activities that for long have not been recognized creative. The current article presents results of the quantitative content analysis of the Business News (in Lithuanian Verslo žinios) daily business newspaper of Lithuania. The instances of the creativity concept and its synonyms use, i.e. novelty, modernity and originality, in the Lithuanian daily newspaper texts, published in 1994–2017, were calculated. The context in which these words were mentioned has been analyzed. The research results demonstrate the consistent increase in the use of the creativity concept and the related notions in texts from the chosen period. At the beginning of the period under examination, the analyzed concepts were employed in the fields traditionally related to creation and arts, such as fine arts, fashion, interior design, and advertising. Later, these concepts have entered the fields of civil engineering and information technology, i.e. the fields that had been based on knowledge and skills. Moreover, creativity notions have been used to describe inter-sectoral areas that are often initiated by project based activities. Creativity has linked entrepreneurship, information technology, innovations, and culture, and has gradually become important in texts, describing politics, education and science. The fields that had traditionally been perceived creative, have now been transformed and changed the concept of creativity, expanding the diversity of creative activities by merging them. It was found that the importance of the perception of creativity in the society, analyzed through the media content, changed in 2003, 2007, and 2014, when creativity became crucial not only in activities traditionally related with arts, but also in business, leadership, information technology, and technology sectors, and has promoted inter-disciplinarity, collaboration among sectors, as well as the pursuit of novelty, utility, and applicability.",Sederevičiūtė-Pačiauskienė Ž.; Adomaitytė G.; Žilinskaitė-Vytienė V.; Navickienė V.; Valantinaitė I.,Journal,Creativity Studies,2018-03-01,Vilniaus Gedimino Technikos Universitetas,Business media ;  Creativity ;  Creativity discourse ;  Media analyses ;  Modernity ;  Novelty ;  Originality
Formation of readiness of future engineers-builders to innovative activity,"In this article, the essence of the effective structure of the components of the readiness for innovative activity of future civil engineers in the conditions of information development of society is considered. The author noted the immediate actual task of modernity, which consists in the high-quality professional training of engineers and construction personnel on a scientific basis using the latest teaching technologies. In the process of research, there is a special need for the formation of elements of popularization and motivation among students to produce their own achievements, as well as creating a bias in the teaching of career-oriented innovation. As shown in the current study, the literature analysis of sources, the current economic situation in Russia, marked the particular urgency of training highly qualified technical specialists, among which a special place is occupied by the engineering and construction industry. According to the author, the goal of higher professional education is to ensure the readiness of a specialist to perform not only professional tasks, but also the correspondence of students' knowledge to the requirements of modern dynamic informatization processes and globalization of all economic spheres of activity. In addition, the future engineers of the builders should be able to make innovative decisions on the result of training, quickly adapt to changes, forecast and implement organizational innovation in the implementation of construction projects. In the article, in order to achieve this goal, an analytical review was also used of psychological and pedagogical literature in the designated aspect, the result of which was the determination of integral professional readiness as an actual category of the theory of innovation activity. The author considers the issues of the urgency of introducing innovative developments and products in the construction sector in the current globalization processes of the Russian market.

Efficient use of clickers: A mixed-method inquiry with university teachers,"With the advancement of information technology and policies encouraging interactivities in teaching and learning, the use of students’ response system (SRS), commonly known as clickers, has experienced substantial growth in recent years. The reported effectiveness of SRS has varied. Based on the framework of technological-pedagogical-content knowledge (TPACK), the current study attempted to explore the disparity in efficiency of adopting SRS. A concurrent mixed method design was adopted to delineate factors conducive to efficient adoption of SRS through closed-ended survey responses and qualitative data. Participants were purposefully sampled from diverse academic disciplines and backgrounds. Seventeen teachers from various disciplines (i.e., tourism management, business, health sciences, applied sciences, engineering, and social sciences) at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University formed a teacher focus group for the current study. In the facilitated focus group, issues relating to efficient use of clickers, participants explored questions on teachers’ knowledge on various technologies, knowledge relating to their subject matters, methods and processes of teaching, as well as how to integrate all knowledge into their teaching. The TPACK model was adopted to guide the discussions. Emergent themes from the discussions were extracted using NVivo 10 for Windows, and were categorized according to the framework of TPACK. The survey, implemented on an online survey platform, solicited participants on teachers’ knowledge and technology acceptance. The close-ended survey comprised 30 items based on the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework and 20 items based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). Participating teachers concurred with the suggestion that use of clickers is instrumental in engaging students in learning and assessing formative students’ progress. Converging with the survey results, several major themes contributing to the successful implementation of clickers, namely technology, technological-pedagogical, technological-content, technological-pedagogical-content knowledge, were identified from the teacher focus groups. The most and second most frequently cited themes were technological-pedagogical-content Knowledge and the technological knowledge respectively. Findings from the current study triangulated with previous findings on TPACK and use of clickers, particularly, the influence of technological-pedagogical-content Knowledge and technological knowledge on successful integration of innovations in class. Furthermore, the current study highlighted the impact of technological-pedagogical and technological-content knowledge for further research to unfold technology adoption with these featured TPACK configurations, as well as rendering support to frontline academics related to integration of technology and pedagogy.",Cheung G.; Wan K.; Chan K.,Journal,Education Sciences,2018-03-01,The Hong Kong Polytechnic University,eLearning ;  Hong Kong ;  Student response system
The construction of the Crystal Houses façade: challenges and innovations,"A novel glass brick façade has been designed and engineered to reproduce the original brick façade of a former townhouse in Amsterdam. Based on the original design the resulting façade comprises more than 6500 solid glass bricks, reinterpreting the traditional brick pattern, and elaborated cast glass elements for the replication of the window and door frames. To achieve unhindered transparency, the 10 by 12 m glass block façade has to be self-supporting. Previous experimental work by Oikonomopoulou et al. (J Facade Design Eng 2(3–4):201–222, 2015b. doi:10.3233/fde-150021) concluded that it was necessary to use a clear, UV-curing adhesive of high stiffness as bonding material. Experimental work on prototype elements indicated that the desired monolithic structural performance of the glass masonry system, as well as a homogeneous visual result, are only achieved when the selected adhesive is applied in a 0.2–0.3 mm thick layer. The nearly zero thickness of the adhesive together with the request for unimpeded transparency introduced numerous engineering challenges. These include the production of highly accurate glass bricks and the homogeneous application of the adhesive to achieve the construction of the entire façade with remarkably tight allowable tolerances. This paper presents the main challenges confronted during the construction of the novel façade and records the innovative solutions implemented, from the casting of the glass units to the completion of the façade. Based on the conclusions of the research and the technical experience gained by the realization of the project, recommendations are made on the further improvement of the presented glass masonry system towards future applications.",Oikonomopoulou F.; Bristogianni T.; Veer F.; Nijsse R.,Journal,Glass Structures and Engineering,2018-03-01,"Faculteit Bouwkunde van de TU Delft;Faculteit Civiele Techniek en Geowetenschappen, TU Delft",Adhesive glass connections ;  Cast glass ;  Crystal Houses façade ;  Glass masonry ;  Solid glass bricks ;  Structural glass
Social sharing institution of SMEs' technology innovation risk,"The social Sharing of SMEs' technological innovation risks is to solve the problem: the failure of the SMEs' technological innovation market mechanism, the inefficiency of SMEs' technological innovation resource allocation, and the lack of SMEs' technological innovation social responsibility. From the perspective of the causes and paths of SMEs' technological innovation risks, it is difficult to effectively solve the problem of the allocation of SMEs' technological innovation risks simply by relying on the developing laws of technology itself and the economic behaviors and market mechanisms of SMEs themselves.

Prospective improvements in cost and cycle life of off-grid lithium-ion battery packs: An analysis informed by expert elicitations,"This paper presents probabilistic estimates of the 2020 and 2030 cost and cycle life of lithium-ion battery (LiB) packs for off-grid stationary electricity storage made by leading battery experts from academia and industry, and insights on the role of public research and development (R&D) funding and other drivers in determining these. By 2020, experts expect developments to arise chiefly through engineering, manufacturing and incremental chemistry changes, and expect additional R&D funding to have little impact on cost. By 2030, experts indicate that more fundamental chemistry changes are possible, particularly under higher R&D funding scenarios, but are not inevitable. Experts suggest that significant improvements in cycle life (eg. doubling or greater) are more achievable than in cost, particularly by 2020, and that R&D could play a greater role in driving these. Experts expressed some concern, but had relatively little knowledge, of the environmental impact of LiBs. Analysis is conducted of the implications of prospective LiB improvements for the competitiveness of solar photovoltaic + LiB systems for off-grid electrification.",Few S.; Schmidt O.; Offer G.; Brandon N.; Nelson J.; Gambhir A.,Journal,Energy Policy,2018-03-01,Imperial College London,"Electricity storage ;  Expert elicitation ;  Innovation ;  Lithium ion batteries ;  Off-grid ;  Research, development, and demonstration"

"Design, learning networks and service innovation","This paper has three main aims. It argues that education is a surprisingly neglected sector of activity in research on service design and innovation and that greater attention to education as a service can shed new light on theoretical and methodological issues in service design and innovation research. It shows how a novel reframing of education activity – as networked learning – can enrich some critical areas of thinking about the analysis, design and evolution of co-produced services more generally. Finally, it identifies a family of participatory design approaches that are particularly well-tuned to the needs of service innovation. The paper shows how contemporary ideas on individual, group and network-wide learning can benefit research on services and service innovation.",Carvalho L.; Goodyear P.,Journal,Design Studies,2018-03-01,Massey University Auckland;The University of Sydney,design practice ;  learning ;  participatory design ;  service design ;  service innovation
IPV6 diffusion on the Internet reaches a critical point,"Every device communicating on the Internet requires a unique Internet Protocol (IP) address which is used to identify that device and to facilitate communication. There are two standards of IP addresses in use today, IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 was the first version of the protocol and has been in use on the Internet since its inception. IPv6 was developed in the mid-1990s as a successor to IPv4 in order to manage the exponential growth of IP addresses required to support new technology. The problem facing the Internet is that there is only a very limited number of unallocated/available IPv4 addresses remaining today, and the entire Internet infrastructure will need to transition to IPv6 if it is to continue to grow. IPv6 represents a virtually unlimited number of addresses to support Internet growth. However, according to Google's IPv6 adoption statistics report (""Google IPv6 Statistics,"" n.d.), usage of IPv6 by devices connecting to the Internet has only reached the 15% mark. IPv6 adoption, or lack thereof, has been a major research topic over the past 20 years as conventional wisdom established the need to transition beyond IPv4. This paper investigates the trend of global IPv6 adoption using six metrics for empirical analysis to evaluate adoption based on Rogers' diffusion of innovation theory. The results show that IPv6 adoption is just entering the early majority phase of Rogers' diffusion curve. Further, the analysis predicts that IPv6 diffusion on the Internet has reached a point of critical mass in the latter half of 2017 and will reach the point of 50% adoption in early 2021. Industrial organizations considering a transition to IPv6 need to act now, and institutions of higher education with technology management curriculum must include IPv6 content to meet the coming technology demand.",Pickard J.; Angolia M.; Chou T.,Journal,"Journal of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering",2018-03-01,East Carolina University,Internet ;  Internet Protocol ;  IPv6 ;  Technology diffusion ;  Technology management
Construction Engineering Research: Integration and Innovation,"Construction engineers play a major role in the built environment by designing construction facilities and field operations and supplying materials. This paper summarizes and synthesizes the results of a research program to increase understanding and effectiveness of two key construction engineering focus areas: integration of project activities, and increasing innovation. Key findings related to project integration include planning activities to improve constructability and foster use of major construction methods. The integration research also included identifying constructability knowledge and using project models to increase its availability for designers. The second main theme of the research is process and product innovation. This investigation used case studies of innovative projects to identify major differences. This increased understanding led to overall findings regarding innovative design and construction organizations and projects and to highlight recommendations for practical applications to increase the scope and rate of innovation in practice. Both parts of the paper contribute to the core body of knowledge regarding construction engineering activities and their vital role in improving project performance in meeting cost, schedule, safety, quality, and sustainability objectives.",Tatum C.,Journal,Journal of Construction Engineering and Management,2018-03-01,Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering,Case studies ;  Construction technology ;  Integration champion ;  Organization and management for innovation ;  Process integration ;  Product innovation ;  Project integration
Intellectual property policies for solar geoengineering,"Governance of solar geoengineering is important and challenging, with particular concern arising from commercial actors’ involvement. Policies relating to intellectual property, including patents and trade secrets, and to data access will shape private actors’ behavior and regulate access to data and technologies. There has been little careful consideration of the possible roles of and interrelationships among commercial actors, intellectual property, and intellectual property policy. Despite the current low level of commercial activity and intellectual property rights in this domain, we expect both to grow as research and development continue. Given the public good nature of solar geoengineering, the relationship between the public and private sectors would likely assume a procurement structure. Innovative policy approaches to intellectual property and data access that are specific to solar geoengineering are warranted. These current circumstances also present opportunities for the development of policy and norms that might soon be lost. We consider some possible approaches, and recommend a bottom-up, primarily nonstate, voluntary “research commons” for patents and data that are related to solar geoengineering. This would facilitate information sharing and limit data fragmentation and trade secrecy. It would also provide an incentive for commons members to pledge to limit some forms of intellectual property acquisition and to assure access on reasonable terms, thereby limiting the need for enforcement. This should help reduce downstream barriers to innovation and to encourage the potential development of technologies at reasonable cost. Such a research commons might also catalyze the adoption of best practices in research and development.

"Green Public Procurement, missing concepts and future trends – A critical review","Green Public Procurement (GPP) is an increasingly debated “demand side” environmental policy instrument. The aim of this paper is to take stock of the related literature, with the twofold aim of developing a conceptual model of the relevant phases of GPP and to identify the related research gaps in detail. The literature analyzed here comprises English language papers, which are focused on GPP during the time period from 2000 to 2016. By means of a systematic literature review and content analysis, we provide both a quantitative and qualitative viewpoint. As our analysis reveals, GPP discussion has mostly focused so far on the specific impacts of GPP implementation, while the discussion on GPP as compared to other environmental policy tools, in terms of efficiency and innovation, is still lagging behind; this is coupled with a limited geographical coverage. Finally, by disaggregating the 17 years period under scrutiny into four sub-periods allows us to outline the changes in research trends over time.",Cheng W.; Appolloni A.; D'Amato A.; Zhu Q.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2018-03-01,"Facoltà di Economia;Antai College of Economics and Management;Università degli Studi di Roma ""Tor Vergata"";Shanghai Jiao Tong University",Content analysis ;  Environmental policy ;  Green Public Procurement (GPP) ;  Leximancer ;  Literature review
"R&D, foreign ownership, and corporate groups: Evidence from Japanese firms","This study empirically examines whether the research and development (R&D) activities of foreign-owned firms in Japan differ notably from the R&D activities of domestically-owned firms based on a firm-level panel dataset. Our study carefully disentangles the significant differences in R&D investment behavior of subsidiaries due to three different reasons: having a foreign parent, corporate group affiliation, and the degree of relatedness between business units. The results reveal the following. First, firms that are majority-owned by another firm are less active in R&D than independent firms. Second, foreign ownership does not matter if the parent firm is from a G7 country, but R&D intensity is significantly and positively associated with foreign ownership if the parent firm is from a non-G7 country. Finally, for subsidiaries whose business is related to that of their parent firm, the R&D intensity is lower if the parent is a domestic firm, but higher if it is a foreign firm. These findings imply that globalization and the integration of firms may not only affect production patterns and global supply chains, but may also have an important impact on the level of domestic R&D activities.",Kwon H.; Park J.,Journal,Research Policy,2018-03-01,Sogang University;Nihon University,Corporate groups ;  Foreign direct investment ;  Foreign ownership ;  Knowledge spillovers ;  R&D

"The future of fish passage science, engineering, and practice","Much effort has been devoted to developing, constructing and refining fish passage facilities to enable target species to pass barriers on fluvial systems, and yet, fishway science, engineering and practice remain imperfect. In this review, 17 experts from different fish passage research fields (i.e., biology, ecology, physiology, ecohydraulics, engineering) and from different continents (i.e., North and South America, Europe, Africa, Australia) identified knowledge gaps and provided a roadmap for research priorities and technical developments. Once dominated by an engineering-focused approach, fishway science today involves a wide range of disciplines from fish behaviour to socioeconomics to complex modelling of passage prioritization options in river networks. River barrier impacts on fish migration and dispersal are currently better understood than historically, but basic ecological knowledge underpinning the need for effective fish passage in many regions of the world, including in biodiversity hotspots (e.g., equatorial Africa, South-East Asia), remains largely unknown. Designing efficient fishways, with minimal passage delay and post-passage impacts, requires adaptive management and continued innovation. While the use of fishways in river restoration demands a transition towards fish passage at the community scale, advances in selective fishways are also needed to manage invasive fish colonization. Because of the erroneous view in some literature and communities of practice that fish passage is largely a proven technology, improved international collaboration, information sharing, method standardization and multidisciplinary training are needed. Further development of regional expertise is needed in South America, Asia and Africa where hydropower dams are currently being planned and constructed.",Silva A.; Lucas M.; Castro-Santos T.; Katopodis C.; Baumgartner L.; Thiem J.; Aarestrup K.; Pompeu P.; O'Brien G.; Braun D.; Burnett N.; Zhu D.; Fjeldstad H.; Forseth T.; Rajaratnam N.; Williams J.; Cooke S.,Journal,Fish and Fisheries,2018-03-01,SINTEF Energi AS;Instream Fisheries Research Incorporated;University of Alberta;Durham University;Trondheim hovedkontor;Simon Fraser University;Universidade Federal de Lavras;Carleton University;University of Washington;Technical University of Denmark;United States Geological Survey;University of KwaZulu-Natal;Charles Sturt University;Katopodis Ecohydraulics Ltd.;Narrandera Fisheries Centre,dams ;  ecohydraulics ;  fish conservation ;  fish migration ;  fishway ;  standardization
Continuous and collaborative technology transfer: Software engineering research with real-time industry impact,"Context: Traditional technology transfer models rely on the assumption that innovations are created in academia, after which they are transferred to industry using a sequential flow of activities. This model is outdated in contemporary software engineering research that is done in close collaboration between academia and industry and in large consortia rather than on a one-on-one basis. In the new setup, research can be viewed as continuous co-experimentation, where industry and academia closely collaborate and iteratively and jointly discover problems and develop, test, and improve solutions. Objective: The objective of the paper is to answer the following research questions: How can high-quality, ambitious software engineering research in a collaborative setup be conducted quickly and on a large scale? How can real-time business feedback to continuously improve candidate solutions be gained? Method: The proposed model has been created, refined, and evaluated in two large, national Finnish software research programs. For this paper, we conducted thematic interviews with representatives of four companies who participated in these programs. Results: The fundamental change is in the mindset of the participants from technology push by academia to technology pull by companies, resulting in co-creation. Furthermore, continuous cooperation between participants enables solutions to evolve in rapid cycles and forms a scalable model of interaction between research institutes and companies. Conclusions: The multifaceted nature of software engineering research calls for numerous approaches. In particular, when working with human-related topics such as company culture and development methods, many discoveries result from seamless collaboration between companies and research institutes.",Mikkonen T.; Lassenius C.; Männistö T.; Oivo M.; Järvinen J.,Journal,Information and Software Technology,2018-03-01,Aalto University;F-Secure Corporation;Oulun Yliopisto;Helsingin Yliopisto,Collaborative research ;  Public–private partnership ;  Software engineering research ;  Technology transfer
Exploring the transformative impacts of service design: The role of designer–client relationships in the service development process,"Based on a multiple case study on Service Design (SD) projects, we discuss different levels of SD's transformative impacts, associated with three types of designer–client relationships. In the ‘delivering’ relationship, SD informs service planning and development practices based on user-centred insights, while affecting physical service resources/technologies. In the ‘partnering’ relationship, SD aligns actors with the target users' experience while extending the SD impact, beyond physical resources/technologies, to human actors. Finally, in the ‘facilitating’ relationship, SD helps client organisations build their own capabilities for sustainable user-centred innovation, while achieving a wider impact on physical resources/technologies, human actors, processes, and routines. The contextual factors and implications of the designer–client relationships for SD practices are also discussed, based on expert interviews.",Yu E.; Sangiorgi D.,Journal,Design Studies,2018-03-01,Politecnico di Milano;Seoil University,case study research ;  designer–client relationships ;  new service development ;  service design
Video content authentication techniques: a comprehensive survey,"In this digital day and age, we are becoming increasingly dependent on multimedia content, especially digital images and videos, to provide a reliable proof of occurrence of events. However, the availability of several sophisticated yet easy-to-use content editing software has led to great concern regarding the trustworthiness of such content. Consequently, over the past few years, visual media forensics has emerged as an indispensable research field, which basically deals with development of tools and techniques that help determine whether or not the digital content under consideration is authentic, i.e., an actual, unaltered representation of reality. Over the last two decades, this research field has demonstrated tremendous growth and innovation. This paper presents a comprehensive and scrutinizing bibliography addressing the published literature in the field of passive-blind video content authentication, with primary focus on forgery/tamper detection, video re-capture and phylogeny detection, and video anti-forensics and counter anti-forensics. Moreover, the paper intimately analyzes the research gaps found in the literature, provides worthy insight into the areas, where the contemporary research is lacking, and suggests certain courses of action that could assist developers and future researchers explore new avenues in the domain of video forensics.

Learning design and technology through social networks for high school students in China,"The subject of design and technology was introduced to the curriculum for high schools in China 10 years ago. However, the teaching and learning of this subject have become difficult for both teachers and students because there is a lack of qualified teachers with design background to deliver this subject in a way to stimulate the learning interests of the students. This paper presents a research that is aimed at improving this situation by integrating the teaching and learning of design and technology within a computational environment as part of social networks sites. The purpose is to enable the collaboration among the students and interaction between teachers and students. In this research, a series of investigations were conducted, by following through several taught subjects in design and technology in prominent high schools in China. Based on these investigations, a theoretical framework for web-based design learning and teaching system in the style of social networking is developed, implemented and tested, emphasizing three features of design: innovation, collaboration, and interaction. This framework has been tested among high school students and teachers in a high school in Nanjing. It identified and validated necessary techniques and design features required to make an education-related social networking site effective and affective for the students and teachers. The results of this research indicated that social networking sites have significantly positive values in design education, especially for the collaboration and interaction on the subject of design and technology.",Jiang H.; Tang M.; Peng X.; Liu X.,Journal,International Journal of Technology and Design Education,2018-03-01,The Hong Kong Polytechnic University;Shenzhen University,Collaborative design ;  Design education ;  Interaction ;  Learning skill ;  Social networking
Continuous clarification and emergent requirements flows in open-commercial software ecosystems,"Software engineering practice has shifted from the development of products in closed environments toward more open and collaborative efforts. Software development has become significantly interdependent with other systems (e.g. services, apps) and typically takes place within large ecosystems of networked communities of stakeholder organizations. Such software ecosystems promise increased innovation power and support for consumer-oriented software services at scale and are characterized by a certain openness of their information flows. While such openness supports project and reputation management, it also brings requirements engineering-related challenges within the ecosystem, such as managing dynamic, emergent contributions from the ecosystem stakeholders, as well as collecting their input while protecting their IP. In this paper, we report from a study of requirements communication and management practices within IBM®’s Collaborative Lifecycle Management® product development ecosystem. Our research used multiple methods for data collection, including interviews within several ecosystem actors, on-site participatory observation, and analysis of online project repositories. We chart and describe the flow of product requirements information through the ecosystem, how the open communication paradigm in software ecosystems provides opportunities for “just-in-time” RE—and which relies on emergent contributions from the ecosystem stakeholders—, as well as some of the challenges faced when traditional requirements engineering approaches are applied within such an ecosystem. More importantly, we discuss two tradeoffs brought about by the openness in software ecosystems: (1) allowing open, transparent communication while keeping intellectual property confidential within the ecosystem and (2) having the ability to act globally on a long-term strategy while empowering product teams to act locally to answer end users’ context-specific needs in a timely manner. A sufficient level of openness facilitates contributions of emergent stakeholders. The ability to include important emergent contributors early in requirements elicitation appears to be a crucial asset in software ecosystems.",Knauss E.; Yussuf A.; Blincoe K.; Damian D.; Knauss A.,Journal,Requirements Engineering,2018-03-01,University of Victoria;Chalmers University of Technology,Mixed method ;  Requirements engineering ;  Software ecosystem
The experiential domain: developing a model for enhancing practice in D&T education,"Creativity and innovation are leading topics for the twenty-first century, not only in individual, cultural or social contexts but also within a wider perspective in business or economic development. For that reason, creative and innovative activities have started to feature in many design-based programs in second level education. Design and Technology (D&T) education has a special importance in promoting creativity and innovation, particularly when conceptual and material aspects of the design process reciprocally support one another. In the classroom, it is common for pupils to take part in creative and innovative activities in pairs or small groups. However, the complex and non-linear nature of these design-based activities calls for dynamic, collaborative problem solving. While collaborative settings and virtual learning environments in D&T education are receiving considerable attention in current research literature, we know very little about shared interactions in design-based activity. Accordingly, there is a need to examine both the collaborative and individual evidence of design-based activity by turning our attention to the interactions around that evidence as teachers and pupils engage in these activities. The purpose of this paper is to examine a pedagogical approach focusing on the social and cognitive interaction of teachers and pupils which is supported by technology and situated in the context of design-based activity. This research found that such interactions not only augmented the design process but led to a conceptual model which demonstrates evidence-based progress through the active configuration of knowledge and understanding.",O’Connor A.; Seery N.; Canty D.,Journal,International Journal of Technology and Design Education,2018-03-01,University of Limerick,Asynchronous interaction ;  Design activity ;  Learning technology ;  Pedagogy ;  Virtual environments

"On ""Self-facilitating"" Templates for technology and innovation strategy workshops","Aligning technology and other functional perspectives for innovation and strategy is challenging. This is compounded by communication barriers arising from high levels of complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity associated with technologically intensive innovation. Conceptual frameworks, tools and methods such as roadmapping, portfolio matrices, and scenario planning are used to support the management of technology and innovation activities. These often have a strong visual aspect that help to address the issues of dialogue exchange and interaction. From a visualisation perspective, roadmapping is of particular interest given its prominence as a flexible method and a highly visual tool. This paper focuses on the mediating role that structured roadmapping templates have during interactive strategy workshops. A quasi-experiment comparing the performance of two templates is reported, comparing a ""classic"" format with a new template that was designed to be ""self-facilitating"". This new template incorporates guidance that a facilitator would normally provide, in order to minimize intervention and empower groups to organize their own strategic discussions.

Evoking equity as a rationale for solar geoengineering research? Scrutinizing emerging expert visions of equity,"This paper examines how notions of equity are being evoked by expert advocates of more research into solar geoengineering. We trace how specific understandings of equity figure centrally—although not always explicitly—in these expert visions. We find that understandings of equity in such “vanguard visions” are narrowly conceived as epistemic challenges, answerable by (more) scientific analysis. Major concerns about equity are treated as empirical matters, requiring scientific assessment of feasibility, risks, or “win–win” distributive outcomes and optimizations, with concurrent calls to delimit risk or reduce scientific uncertainties. We argue that such epistemic framings sidestep, inter alia, the inequality in resources available to diverse non-experts—including the “vulner-able” evoked in expert visions—to project their own equity perspectives onto imagined technological pathways of the future. These may include concerns relating to moral or historical responsibility and/or lack of agency in shaping the directions of innovation. We conclude that the performative power and political implications of specific expert visions of equity, evoked as a rationale to undertake solar geoengineering research, require continued scrutiny.",Flegal J.; Gupta A.,Journal,"International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics",2018-02-01,"University of California, Berkeley;Wageningen University & Research",Climate engineering ;  Climate governance ;  Climate models ;  Equity ;  Paris agreement ;  Solar geoengineering ;  Speculative ethics ;  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change

An ideology of IT occupational culture: The ASPIRE values,"Many have conjectured that people in the IT occupation are different from non-IT business users and that such differences can lead to negative organizational outcomes. This study investigates how to measure these differences by developing a new, expanded theoretical framework of IT occupational culture (ITOC). This framework includes: Artifacts, Values, and Tacit Assumptions. Values form the core of any culture, and a cohesive set of cultural values is termed an ""ideology."" Using a mixed methodology, research was conducted in two parts to develop and measure an ideology of ITOC. A qualitative investigation based on interview data provided evidence of six core values in the ideology: Autonomy in Decision-Making, Structure in Environment, Precision in Communication, Innovation in Technology, Reverence for Technical Knowledge, and Enjoyment at the Workplace (ASPIRE). The quantitative investigation sought to validate the values and ultimately reduced the number of values to five based on factor analysis of survey data: Autonomy in Decision-Making, Structure/Precision, Innovation in Technology, Reverence for Technical Knowledge, and Enjoyment at the Workplace. IT respondents rated these values significantly higher than non-IT business personnel.

From Expert Discipline to Common Practice: A Vision and Research Agenda for Extending the Reach of Enterprise Modeling,"The benefits of enterprise modeling (EM) and its contribution to organizational tasks are largely undisputed in business and information systems engineering. EM as a discipline has been around for several decades but is typically performed by a limited number of people in organizations with an affinity to modeling. What is captured in models is only a fragment of what ought to be captured. Thus, this research note argues that EM is far from its maximum potential. Many people develop some kind of model in their local practice without thinking about it consciously. Exploiting the potential of this “grass roots modeling” could lead to groundbreaking innovations. The aim is to investigate integration of the established practices of modeling with local practices of creating and using model-like artifacts of relevance for the overall organization. The paper develops a vision for extending the reach of EM, identifies research areas contributing to the vision and proposes elements of a future research agenda.",Sandkuhl K.; Fill H.; Hoppenbrouwers S.; Krogstie J.; Matthes F.; Opdahl A.; Schwabe G.; Uludag Ö.; Winter R.,Journal,Business and Information Systems Engineering,2018-02-01,Hogeschool van Arnhem en Nijmegen;Universitetet i Bergen;University of St. Gallen;Technische Universität München;Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet;Universität Zürich;Universität Bamberg;Universität Rostock,Enterprise modeling ;  Grass roots modeling ;  Research agenda
Evolution of CO<inf>2</inf> capture technology between 2007 and 2017 through the study of patent activity,"Energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to increase by approximately 30% by 2040. Based on this increase, the capture and storage of CO2 are presented as a suitable opportunity to decrease emissions. This study offers a preliminary overview of state-of-the-art CO2 capture patents during the past decade (2007–2017). More than 28,000 patents and 5000 scientific documents were collected, analysed and classified in terms of the Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) criteria. Most patent generation activity is concentrated in capture technologies that use absorption and adsorption chemical processes (within 35% and 30% of the collected documents, respectively). Moreover, companies such as Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems Europe GmbH, Alstom Technology Ltd., ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company and Air Liquide SA dominate the development of these main capture technologies. Specialized companies such as CO2 Solutions Inc., Akermin Inc. and UOP LLC are leaders in membrane systems or biological processes; however, there are fewer publications related to these technologies. Most of the patent activity is occurring in the USA, Japan, China and Korea (responsible for 64% of the innovations); also highlighting the role of international offices such as the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and the European Patent Office (EPO) (with 22% of patent generation). The growing knowledge of patent generation over the past decade indicates that CO2 capture technologies have inspired environmental and economic interest, making it possible to develop established processes that can be implemented by the current industry and to optimize the existing industries. The idea of knowing what are the most active companies in terms of patent production and the fields where they are working, give competitors information about the identification of development trends and economically viable investigation lines.",Luis Míguez J.; Porteiro J.; Pérez-Orozco R.; Patiño D.; Rodríguez S.,Journal,Applied Energy,2018-02-01,Universidade de Vigo;Clarke,CO  capture technology 2 ;  CPC code ;  Patent
Recovery of nanomaterials from battery and electronic wastes: A new paradigm of environmental waste management,"Recycling battery and electronic wastes for the recovery of nanomaterials (NMs) has ushered in a new era in nanotechnology and environmental research. Essentially, NM recycling offers a two-way method of environmental remediation. The potential economic benefits of high-value NM end-products are conducive for industrial scale operations. Simultaneously, it reduces the industrial consumption of finite primary resources. The added benefits of abating environmental pollution (e.g., from VOCs, VFAs, SO2, NOx, and heavy metals) further contributes to the significance of ongoing research in this particular area. However, some challenges still persist due to the lack of motivation for recycling and the problem of the limited usability (or low stability) of many of the end-products. In this study, we aimed to evaluate different basic aspects of waste recycling in relation to NM recovery, along with other associated techniques. The utility of recovered NMs and potential options for NM recovery are described as highlighting features to help construct a future roadmap for this emerging scientific field. In addition, an assessment of the potential economic returns from recycling high-purity NMs is provided. Outcomes of this review may fuel further innovations for optimizing the current recycling methods for the efficient synthesis of commercial-grade, high purity NMs at minimal cost.",Dutta T.; Kim K.; Deep A.; Szulejko J.; Vellingiri K.; Kumar S.; Kwon E.; Yun S.,Journal,Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,2018-02-01,Central Scientific Instruments Organization Chandigarh;Sejong University;Hanyang University;Korea University;Guru Jambheshwar University of Science & Technology,End-of-life products ;  Green engineering ;  Nanomaterial recycling ;  Waste regeneration
From invisibility to impact: Recognising the scientific and societal relevance of interdisciplinary sustainability research,"Academics are increasingly expected to produce concrete and directly applicable solutions to hard-to-solve ‘real-world problems’ such as poverty, development, and environmental degradation. However, conventional assessments of the impact of science on society have not yet been adequately adapted to capture the diverse effects of this type of problem-centred research. Drawing on a case study of a large-scale project on (un)sustainable consumption, this paper demonstrates the range, complexity and potential long-term nature of impact in interdisciplinary sustainability research. It thus supports arguments for alternative approaches to impact assessment that question conventional views of translating scientific knowledge into action, value the multi-directionality of science-society relations and recognise diverse forms of engagement between scientists and non-scientific actors through non-academic channels and outputs. The paper also challenges common (mis)conceptions of work practices in a university context by demonstrating the highly innovative and inclusive nature of much sustainability research that seeks to address the needs of diverse communities of actors. It is argued that only radically different ways of conceptualising and measuring short-, medium- and long-term impacts can capture the success or otherwise of social-scientific and interdisciplinary sustainability research.",Rau H.; Goggins G.; Fahy F.,Journal,Research Policy,2018-02-01,Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München;University of Galway,Impact assessment ;  Knowledge ;  Science-society relations ;  Sustainability research
Gaining insight into interdisciplinary research and education programmes: A framework for evaluation,"Greater understanding of how interdisciplinary research and education evolves is critical for identifying and implementing appropriate programme management strategies. In this paper a programme evaluation framework is presented. It is based on social learning processes (individual learning, interdisciplinary research practices, and interaction between researchers with different backgrounds); social capital outcomes (ability to interact, interpersonal connectivity, and shared understanding); and knowledge and human capital outcomes (new knowledge that integrates multiple research fields). The framework is illustrated on an established case study doctoral programme. Data are collected via mixed qualitative/quantitative methods to reveal several interesting findings about how interdisciplinary research evolves and can be supported. Firstly, different aspects of individual learning seem to contribute to a researcher's ability to interact with researchers from other research fields and work collaboratively. These include learning new material from different research fields, learning how to learn new material and learning how to integrate different material. Secondly, shared interdisciplinary research practices can be identified that may be common to other programmes and support interaction and shared understanding between different researchers. They include clarification and questioning, harnessing differences and setting defensible research boundaries. Thirdly, intensive interaction between researchers from different backgrounds support connectivity between the researchers, further enabling collaborative work. The case study data suggest that social learning processes and social capital outcomes precede new interdisciplinary research findings and are therefore a critical aspect to consider in interdisciplinary programme management.",Carr G.; Loucks D.; Blöschl G.,Journal,Research Policy,2018-02-01,Cornell University College of Engineering;Technische Universität Wien,Collaboration ;  Doctoral education ;  Interdisciplinary ;  Multi-disciplinary ;  Programme evaluation ;  Water research
From Genetic Stock to Genome Editing: Gene Exploitation in Wheat,"Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) ranks as one of our most important staple crops. However, its hexaploid nature has complicated our understanding of the genetic bases underlying many of its traits. Historically, functional genetic studies in wheat have focused on identifying natural variations and have contributed to assembling and enriching its genetic stock. Recently, mold-breaking advances in whole genome sequencing, exome-capture based mutant libraries, and genome editing have revolutionized strategies for genetic research in wheat. We review new trends in wheat functional genetic studies along with germplasm conservation and innovation, including the relevance of genetic stocks, and the application of sequencing-based mutagenesis and genome editing. We also highlight the potential of multiplex genome editing toolkits in addressing species-specific challenges in wheat.",Wang M.; Wang S.; Liang Z.; Shi W.; Gao C.; Xia G.,Journal,Trends in Biotechnology,2018-02-01,Shandong University;Chinese Academy of Sciences;Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology Chinese Academy of Sciences,agronomically important genes ;  bread wheat ;  functional genetics ;  genetic stock ;  genome editing
Innovating Safe Lithium-Ion Batteries Through Basic to Applied Research,"This paper for inclusion in the special issue provides a brief synopsis of lithium-ion battery safety research efforts at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and presents the viewpoint that lithium-ion battery safety is a growing research area for both academic and applied researchers. We quantify how the number of lithium-ion battery research efforts worldwide has plateaued while publications associated with the safety aspect of lithium-ion batteries are on a rapid incline. The safety challenge creates a unique research opportunity to not only understand basic phenomena but also enhance existing fielded system through advanced controls and prognostics. As the number of lithium-ion battery safety research contributions climbs, significant advancements will come in the area of modeling across multiple time and length scales. Additionally, the utility of in situ and in operando techniques, several performed by the NRL and our collaborators, will feed the data necessary to validate these models. Lithium-ion battery innovations are no longer tied to performance metrics alone, but are increasingly dependent on safety research to unlock their full potential. There is much work to be done.",Love C.; Buesser C.; Johannes M.; Swider-Lyons K.,Journal,Journal of Electrochemical Energy Conversion and Storage,2018-02-01,"Excet, Inc.;U.S. Naval Research Laboratory",
Measuring the energy innovation process: An indicator framework and a case study of wind energy in China,"Whilst a well-established literature on metrics to assess innovation performance exists, relatively little work has linked it to the energy technology innovation process. This paper systematically brings together indicator sets and derives an indicator framework for measuring energy innovation, offering an important step forward in the quantitative evaluation of energy innovation performance. It incorporates input, output and outcome metrics that relate to different stages along the energy technology innovation chain, namely research, development, demonstration, market formation and diffusion. To test its efficacy, the indicator framework is applied to the case of wind energy in China, drawing comparisons against global market leaders such as Denmark, Germany and the USA. The paper finds that the framework enables a more rigorous comparative analysis of energy innovation between countries than currently offered by either the application of piecemeal indicators and complements contextually rich qualitative case studies. The empirical analysis shows that China has begun to lead across a range of innovation inputs (e.g. R&D expenditure) and outputs (e.g. publications) but lags considerably behind international competitors against other output and outcome indicators such as patents, revenue and exports.",Hu R.; Skea J.; Hannon M.,Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2018-02-01,"Strathclyde Business School, United Kingdom;Imperial College London",China ;  Energy technology innovation ;  Innovation metrics ;  Innovation system
Serendipity: Towards a taxonomy and a theory,"Serendipity, the notion of researchers making unexpected and beneficial discoveries, has played an important role in debates about the feasibility and desirability of targeting public R&D investments. The purpose of this paper is to show that serendipity can come in different forms and come about in a variety of ways. The archives of Robert K Merton, who introduced the term to the social sciences, were used as a starting point for gathering literature and examples. I identify four types of serendipity (Walpolian, Mertonian, Bushian, Stephanian) together with four mechanisms of serendipity (Theory-led, Observer-led, Error-borne, Network-emergent). I also discuss implications of the different types and mechanisms for theory and policy.",Yaqub O.,Journal,Research Policy,2018-02-01,University of Sussex,Innovation management ;  Research policy ;  Science policy ;  Serendipity ;  Technology policy ;  Uncertainty
Innovation intermediaries and collaboration: Knowledge–based practices and internal value creation,"This paper analyses how knowledge-based practices adopted by innovation intermediaries enable them to generate value for themselves when collaborating with their clients. While the literature focuses on value creation for their client organisations, little is known about how innovation intermediaries create internal value even though this is essential for ensuring their long-term survival and sustaining their key facilitating role in the innovation system. This understudied issue is explored using empirical evidence from a sub-set of innovation intermediaries, Research and Technology Organisations (RTOs). The results indicate that by capitalising on existing knowledge vested in employees and collaborators as well as understanding and shaping the knowledge base of the innovation ecosystem, innovation intermediaries generate internal value from their involvement in collaborative innovation, which range from different financial to non-financial types of value. Implications for intermediaries, their collaborators and for policymakers are then discussed.",De Silva M.; Howells J.; Meyer M.,Journal,Research Policy,2018-02-01,"Kent Business School;University of Oxford;Birkbeck, University of London",European union ;  Innovation intermediaries ;  Knowledge based practices ;  Knowledge capitalization ;  Research and technology organisations ;  Value creation
The new production of legitimacy: STI policy discourses beyond the contract metaphor,"Science, technology and innovation (STI) policy is borne by a set of historically contingent concepts, models, and metaphors. From around 1950 to 1980, its language was dominated by the contract metaphor and the linear model of innovation, both of which have catered for beliefs in stability, orderliness, and distinct social roles for scientists and policymakers. While prominent new models of the 1990s (mode 2, post-normal science, triple helix) had challenged the old contract metaphor, they remained experts’ brainchildren. After 2000, in contrast, we observe the emergence and pluralization of several new and powerful concepts. Building on conceptual history and cognitive linguistics, we analyze three of these new concepts: “frontier research,” “grand challenges,” and “responsible research and innovation” (RRI). Whereas the “frontier” and “grand challenges” convey many layered historical meanings, a distinct metaphorical appeal, and have become popularized beyond expert's communities, the RRI discourse, though the most ambitious one, has not yet shaken off its roots in the bureaucratic structures of the European Commission. Finally, we discuss which conceptual and metaphorical properties enable the career of STI policy discourses in the 21st century.",Flink T.; Kaldewey D.,Journal,Research Policy,2018-02-01,Universität Bonn;Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin,Conceptual history ;  Frontier research ;  Grand challenges ;  Metaphorical analysis ;  Responsible research and innovation ;  STI policy discourses
Collaborative innovation in construction project: A social network perspective,"Successful innovation requires effective cooperation and working relationships among different parties within construction projects. In order to promote construction innovation performance, it is important to shed light on the internal mechanism of innovation through investigating collaborative relationships from a network perspective. In this case, the formation of collaborative relationship can be viewed as a potential generator of innovation processes, and relationship network indicates information exchanges among organizations. This article investigates the collaborative relationship network in a commercial complex by using social network method and in-depth quantitative data analysis. Structural Equation Modeling(SEM) is usually used to analyze the impacts of collaborative relationship on innovation performance in construction projects. There are more and more stakeholders in construction projects, and organization relationship presents a significant network trend. Social network method is widely applied in innovative research. Combined with quantitative data, it is able to quantify and visual the interaction relations of innovation stakeholder. The analytical results will be more objective and reliable. Social network analysis can describe and analyzed collaborative relationship combining qualitative and quantitative method. The results illustrate the relatively dense collaborative relationship networks and highlight the roles that the key members played in the innovation process. The decomposition of collaborative relationship with network analysis contributes to a better understanding of innovation process in construction projects. In particular, key nodes which influence construction innovation through collaborative relationships are revealed and analyzed.",Xue X.; Zhang R.; Wang L.; Fan H.; Yang R.; Dai J.,Journal,KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering,2018-02-01,"RMIT University, School of Property, Construction and Project Management;Liaoning Technical University;Harbin Institute of Technology;ConocoPhillips Company;The Hong Kong Polytechnic University",collaborative relationship ;  construction project ;  innovation ;  relationship network ;  social network analysis
Organizing a Collaborative Development of Technological Design Requirements Using a Constructive Dialogue on Value Profiles: A Case in Automated Vehicle Development,"Following societal and policy pressures for responsible innovation, innovators are more and more expected to consider the broader socio-ethical context of their work, and more importantly, to integrate such considerations into their daily practices. This may require the involvement of ‘outsiders’ in innovation trajectories, including e.g. societal and governmental actors. However, methods on how to functionally organize such integration in light of responsible innovation have only recently started to emerge. We present an approach to do just that, in which we first develop value profiles of the involved actors, and second, design a workshop setting that allows innovators to develop design requirements in collaboration with representatives of parties that are not usually involved in such innovation design practices. Using a case study in automated vehicle development, we positively demonstrate the possibility and utility of our approach. We stress that in this study we wish to demonstrate the functionality of our developed method, and did not search for scientifically valid outcomes regarding this technical field.",Flipse S.; Puylaert S.,Journal,Science and Engineering Ethics,2018-02-01,Delft University of Technology,Automated vehicles ;  Co-creation ;  Constructive dialogue ;  Design requirements ;  Responsible innovation
Experimental study on hydrodynamic performances of naval propellers to adopt new additive manufacturing processes,"In the past few years, a new generation of additive manufacturing (AM) techniques has rapidly become available due to the expiration of some AM patents which allowed significant cost reductions. This article explores some available techniques fostering products innovation in experimental laboratories for the development of naval propulsion, where high costs represent an important limitation for both basic research and industrial testing, by identifying significant knowledge and variables and by providing reliable and accurate data to support designers and researchers. The propeller INSEAN E779a case study was taken into account and fabricated by direct metal laser sintering in AlSi10Mg aluminium alloy and by fused deposition modeling in acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene, and UltraT polymeric materials. The study of printing parameters, flexural tests, differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis, allowed to optimize the printing process conditions. A reverse engineering system, Faro-CAM2, and the iterative closest point algorithm of the geomagic control software were used to analyse deviations from the printed propeller and the CAD nominal model. The atomic force microscopy test allowed to assess the morphological features and surface roughness of printed propellers. Towing Tank tests were carried out and the hydrodynamic performance comparison was analysed in terms of torque and drag. The results of this study show differences between the benchmark and AM propellers, as a function of the advance coefficient J, the morphological characteristics and the materials. However this study also shows a substantial adequacy of AM propellers in most studies carried out in Towing Tank.",Staiano G.; Gloria A.; Ausanio G.; Lanzotti A.; Pensa C.; Martorelli M.,Journal,International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing,2018-02-01,"CNR - SuPerconducting and other INnovative materials and devices institute, Napoli;Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche;Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II",Additive manufacturing (AM) ;  Marine propeller ;  Reverse engineering (RE)

If memory serves: Towards designing and evaluating a game for teaching pointers to undergraduate students,"Games can serve as a valuable tool for enriching computer science education, since they can facilitate a number of conditions that can promote learning and instigate affective change. As part of the 22nd ACM Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE 2017), the Working Group on Game Development for Computer Science Education convened to extend their prior work, a review of the literature and a review of over 120 educational games that support computing instruction. The Working Group builds off this earlier work to design and develop a prototype of a game grounded in specific learning objectives. They provide the source code for the game to the computing education community for further review, adaptation, and exploration. To aid this endeavor, the Working Group also chose to explore the research methods needed to establish validity, highlighting a need for more rigorous approaches to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of games in computer science education. This report provides two distinct contributions to the body of knowledge in games for computer science education.We present an experience report in the form of a case study describing the design and development of If Memory Serves, a game to support teaching pointers to undergraduate students.

Bibliometrics and networks: Case of a multinational perspective on how eco-innovation has evolved in academic literature,"Recent studies in literature on eco-innovation have adopted a systematic approach, rather than taking advantage of what the iMetrics method - different types of information studies such as bibliometrics, scientometrics, and informetrics - can contribute to the understanding of how knowledge increases and develops in a particular field. This chapter contributes to filling this gap by completing what other studies have already revealed. Our contribution adds information about the evolution in research on eco-innovation and the distinct nature of the knowledge generated by most important countries in the field. In this chapter, through the examination of scientific papers indexed in the Web of Science and Scopus databases, an analysis of co-keywords was undertaken through the use of Social Network Analysis. These results indicated that: (a) eco-innovation was related to environment, management, and engineering; (b) evolution in the field moved toward a practitioner context, a factor which is shown in the changes of the most important keywords; and (c) mapping the science in this field is contextual, depicting the structural characteristics of different countries. These results may be of interest to researchers, practitioners, and policy makers. In particular, researchers can make interesting contacts and detect gaps for future research; practitioners can find institutions and researchers to work with; and policy makers can use the differences between knowledge patterns in the different countries for decision-making.",de-Miguel-Molina B.; de-Miguel-Molina M.; Segarra-Oña M.; Peiró-Signes Á.,Book,Innovation Discovery: Network Analysis Of Research And Invention Activity For Technology Management,2018-01-22,Universitat Politècnica de València,Bibliometrics ;  Eco-innovation ;  Environmental innovation ;  Green innovation ;  Imetrics ;  Social network analysis ;  Sustainable innovation
"Innovation enterprise as a vehicle for sustainable development – A general framework for the design of typical strategies based on enterprise systems engineering, dynamic capabilities, and option thinking","The development of strategies, actions and programs on sustainability through innovation has been taking into account within the current essential and disorderly train of events. The issue of designing mechanisms was considered by institutions and organizations, which innovate on sustainability, the way of speeding the progress, as well as the process of learning on sustainability. There has been always a concern over forwarding the incremental innovations, which actually improve or renew the already existing ideas and practices at the level of system, or even the SoS systems' level, together with a new focus over the technical, social-human and environment or markets interspaces. The main issue regards the type of changes necessary on transforming the sustainability (new institutions, public politics, strategies of settlements, new ways of thinking and business practices). The analysis of innovative part within the process of economic and social change should gather interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and trans-disciplinary research. Although there is an obvious agenda of integrating the sustainability within the process of innovation, the long-term approach has not been provided with a phasing and the process has been quite complex. The current global process has been characterized by a socio-technological dynamism of an accurate changing management, more exactly by the oscillation between intervals of normality and steadiness and disorderly and volatile intervals that influence the design way of strategies, since these should understand and integrate the new dynamics of change, of markets and of the external environment. The traditional approach cannot show such mixtures of dynamics and cut-off over the markets and stakeholders. This paper emphasizes the synergic assortment between the systematic control of innovation for sustainable development focused on the internal environment and that based on a mix between the concept of innovation enterprise in context of enterprise systems engineering, the dynamic capabilities for spectral selection in a multiple dynamics and option thinking as a paradigm well adapted in innovation. The dynamic capabilities, seen as “strategy of creating the strategies” have offered a quick qualitative image, so that this approach has been combined with the paradigm of real options, within a frame that proposes the active control over the extended performance of innovation enterprise. The novelty has been offered by the possibility of emphasizing some mechanism of inter-correlations between innovation enterprise, the dynamic capabilities, as strategic tool of high level and the real options, as tool of option thinking on one hand, and the capabilities for innovation on extended way, on the other hand. Adapting the paradigm of dynamic capabilities to the oscillation between the normality or steadiness times and those full of disorder and volatility, by means of real composed options, has offered a dynamic image of relative performance, during a complex process. Viewing the performances progress in two steps and two volatilities has been quite significant, since it offered the possibility of some immediate actions of reconfigurations and conformation to.",Boscoianu M.; Prelipcean G.; Lupan M.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2018-01-20,Universitatea Transilvania din Brașov;Universitatea Stefan cel Mare din Suceava,Dynamic capabilities (DC) ;  Enterprise systems engineering (ESE) ;  Innovation enterprise ;  Option thinking
Assessment framework for pavement material and technology elements in green highway index,"Sustainability concept in highway development needs to be addressed critically in order to alleviate the effect of global warming and depletion of natural resources issues. In Malaysia, there are a lot of alternative pavement materials and technology that have been introduced to the industry so that green highway can be achieved. However, Malaysia does not have any tools to assess the level of greenness for any highway projects and still lacks of awareness in sustainable highway. Thus, the main objective of this study is to develop an assessment framework for pavement material and technology elements in Malaysia green highway index. An extensive literature were reviewed and expert discussion was conducted to identify the 13 vital elements of pavement material and technology which include regional materials; reuse of top soil; reused and/or recycled of non-hazardous materials; earthwork balance; usage of industrial by-products; subgrade improvement/soil stabilization, permeable pavement, pavement design life, quiet pavement, recycled pavement or new sustainable techniques; cool pavement; soil biotechnical engineering treatment; and green techniques. Questionnaires were distributed among the 109 highway practitioners to obtain their agreement level on these elements. Then, all the data were analyzed by using factor analysis approach which generated from Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software. The assessment score of each element was calculated from the findings and assessment framework for pavement material and technology elements was established. Results show that all the elements were grouped into four main factor namely environmental control, economical resources, innovation technology and erosion control with four point was considered as a maximum point score to be achieved in green highway assessment framework. Hence, the research clearly indicates that these elements are essential to be implemented in Malaysia's highway development indirectly as an encouragement to improve the performance of transportation sector.",Bujang M.; Hainin M.; Abd Majid M.; Idham Mohd Satar M.; Azahar W.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2018-01-20,Universiti Teknologi Malaysia;University College of Technology Sarawak,Green highway ;  Pavement material and technology elements ;  Sustainability
Roadmapping towards sustainability proficiency in engineering education,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to deliver a roadmap that displays pathways to develop sustainability skills in the engineering curricula. Design/methodology/approach: The selected approach to enrich engineering students with sustainability skills was active learning methodologies. First, a survey was carried out on a sample of 189 students to test the current sustainability literacy and determine the roadmap starting point. Next, a scientometric study regarding active learning methodologies was executed. A total of 2,885 articles and conference proceedings from the period 2013-2016 were retrieved from the Web of Science database. The records were then imported into text mining software to undergo a term clumping process. Annual knowledge clusters based on key terms were outputted. Finally, a roadmap was created by experts based on the annual knowledge clusters. Findings: Four annual pathways were created along the roadmap to develop sustainability skills during the four-year college course in engineering. The first consisted on promoting a recycling campaign through a circular economy. The second aimed at creating educational videos regarding sustainability. The third reinforced reasoning and argumentative skills by preparing a debate on environmental issues. The last path assumed that the student is working in internship programs and prepared him/her to apply environmental management models to solve sustainability issues within the company. Research limitations/implications: Roadmaps should be updated approximately every two years to reflect novelty. The proposed methodology shows an easy way to create them.

"Assessing the feasibility of integrating ecosystem-based with engineered water resource governance and management for water security in semi-arid landscapes: A case study in the Banas catchment, Rajasthan, India","Much of the developing world and areas of the developed world suffer water vulnerability. Engineering solutions enable technically efficient extraction and diversion of water towards areas of demand but, without rebalancing resource regeneration, can generate multiple adverse ecological and human consequences. The Banas River, Rajasthan (India), has been extensively developed for water diversion, particularly from the Bisalpur Dam from which water is appropriated by powerful urban constituencies dispossessing local people. Coincidentally, abandonment of traditional management, including groundwater recharge practices, is leading to increasingly receding and contaminated groundwater. This creates linked vulnerabilities for rural communities, irrigation schemes, urban users, dependent ecosystems and the multiple ecosystem services that they provide, compounded by climate change and population growth. This paper addresses vulnerabilities created by fragmented policy measures between rural development, urban and irrigation water supply and downstream consequences for people and wildlife. Perpetuating narrowly technocentric approaches to resource exploitation is likely only to compound emerging problems. Alternatively, restoration or innovation of groundwater recharge practices, particularly in the upper catchment, can represent a proven, ecosystem-based approach to resource regeneration with linked beneficial socio-ecological benefits. Hybridising an ecosystem-based approach with engineered methods can simultaneously increase the security of rural livelihoods, piped urban and irrigation supplies, and the vitality of river ecosystems and their services to beneficiaries. A renewed policy focus on local-scale water recharge practices balancing water extraction technologies is consistent with emerging Rajasthani policies, particularly Jal Swavlamban Abhiyan (‘water self-reliance mission’). Policy reform emphasising recharge can contribute to water security and yield socio-economic outcomes through a systemic understanding of how the water system functions, and by connecting goals and budgets across multiple, currently fragmented policy areas. The underpinning principles of this necessary paradigm shift are proven and have wider geographic relevance, though context-specific research is required to underpin robust policy and practical implementation.",Everard M.; Sharma O.; Vishwakarma V.; Khandal D.; Sahu Y.; Bhatnagar R.; Singh J.; Kumar R.; Nawab A.; Kumar A.; Kumar V.; Kashyap A.; Pandey D.; Pinder A.,Journal,Science of the Total Environment,2018-01-15,"Wetlands International, India;JK Lakshmipat University;Indian Institute of Technology Delhi;Bournemouth University;University of the West of England;Forest Department;Biodiversity;Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Rajasthan);Wells for India;Tiger Watch;Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve",Banas ;  Bisalpur ;  Community-based recharge ;  Ecosystem services ;  Vulnerability ;  Water resources

Frugal approach to innovation: State of the art and future perspectives,"Frugal innovation has recently become a relevant topic in the public domain. The real challenge for frugal innovation is to introduce something new or different (innovating) whilst being sparing with resources (frugal). Traditionally, it has been investigated in relation to emerging and developing countries. However, scholars and institutions have pointed out that the phenomenon is growing in relevance in advanced economies too. As a consequence, some scholars have started soliciting attempts to systematize this emerging field of research. Based on these premises, the study aims to: explore how the frugal innovation concept has developed over the years; analyze the main key findings from the extant literature on frugal innovation to lay a foundation for subsequent works, by identifying gaps in current knowledge; highlight new directions for future research. In doing so, we carried out a systematic literature review (SLR) and analyzed 113 articles that have been published since 1990. We asked experts to validate the main research gaps we had identified through the SLR. As a whole, results show that experts identify - for both emerging and developing countries and for advanced economies - various relevant future research directions.",Pisoni A.; Michelini L.; Martignoni G.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2018-01-10,Università degli Studi dell'Insubria;Libera Università Maria Ss.

Research progress and application prospect of Fe-based soft magnetic amorphous/nanocrystalline alloys,"Amorphous alloy is a kind of metallic materials prepared by rapidly cooling the alloy melt through hindering crystallization in cooling process. Due to the unique structure of atomic random packing, Fe-based amorphous alloys exhibit not only structural and property isotropy, but also small structural correlation length, small magnetic anisotropic constant, and then small coercivity Hc. Like crystalline Fe-based alloys, Fe-based amorphous alloys also possess high saturation induction Bs. As a result, research on engineering applications of Fe-based amorphous alloys has been promoted by their excellent soft magnetic properties. Now Fe-based soft magnetic amorphous/nanocrystalline alloys have been produced and applied to various areas on a large scale. Here in this paper, the processes of discovery, development and application of Fe-based soft magnetic amorphous alloys are reviewed, and the effects of chemical composition, structure and preparation technology on the soft magnetic properties are introduced and discussed. The obtained theoretic results and the technological innovation show that the great contributions have been made to the development and application of Fe-based soft magnetic amorphous/crystalline alloys. Based on the progress of structure and soft magnetic property and our understanding, the development process of the fundamental research and the application progress of Fe-based soft magnetic amorphous alloys could be divided into three periods.

"Confronting climate change challenges to dryland cereal production: A call for collaborative, transdisciplinary research, and producer engagement","Semi-arid cereal systems face challenges worldwide that are driven by ongoing and projected climate change. These challenges include ensuring cropping system resilience and productivity under changing water and temperature regimes while reversing soil degradation, reducing crop susceptibility to pests, pathogens and weed competition, and exploiting genetic resources to develop cultivars with resilience to climate stresses and improved compatibility with cropping system innovations. Meeting these interdependent challenges requires transdisciplinary efforts that integrate knowledge across many scientific domains. The USDA-NIFA-funded coordinated agricultural project, ""Regional Approaches to Climate Change for Pacific Northwest Agriculture"" (REACCH), employed this transdisciplinary approach to address climate change and sustainability challenges for rain-fed cereal-based systems in the semi-arid intermountain Pacific Northwest. To engage with and contribute to similar efforts globally, REACCH sponsored a workshop ""Transitioning Cereal Systems to Adapt to Climate Change"" (TCSACC) in November 2015. Participants from 17 countries and five continents with expertise in agronomy, crop physiology, crop modeling, crop protection, breeding and genetics, sociology and economics shared their perspectives, successes, and challenges to achieving transdisciplinary research integration for semi-arid cereal systems under changing climates. Conference goals were to: (1) strengthen the global network of researchers addressing climate change effects on semi-arid cereal-based systems, (2) share the approaches to achieving transdisciplinary collaboration to advance climate change resilience in cereal systems, and (3) identify the elements of a collaborative research agenda that are needed to advance global food security in the twenty-first century. This paper distills the conference themes and summarizes the calls to action that were discussed: Establish coordinated, large scale, transdisciplinary efforts; Consider Genetic × Environment × Management × Social system (G × E × M × S) interactions; Integrate social, economic, and biophysical science, and engineering; Improve integration among knowledge communities; Consider global context of production systems; Develop more inclusive cropping system models; Enable comprehensive data management and data sharing; Include landscape and ecosystem services perspectives; Establish and support existing global collaboration networks.",Eigenbrode S.; Patrick Binns W.; Huggins D.,Journal,Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution,2018-01-04,University of Idaho;Washington State University Pullman;Westbrook Associates LLC,Agroecology ;  Cereals ;  Climate ;  Collaboration ;  Farmers ;  Research ;  Resilient ;  Transdisciplinary
Integrated innovative biotechnology for optimization of environmental bioprocesses and a green economy,"A systematic approach to sustainable management of natural resources incorporates integration of innovative biotechnologies and eco-engineering. Here we review complementary eco-innovations for sustainable development in different regions. One of the newer biotechnologies is laser photostimulation of different species of plants and microorganisms to increase their adaptability to xenobiotics in soil, air, and water. Empirically selected algorithms of laser irradiation significantly increase biodegradation of hydrocarbons, phytoremediation of trace metals by willow Salix sp., elephant grass Miscanthus x giganteus, Virginian mallow Sida hermaphrodita, and to increase tolerance of different species of plants to petrochemical pollutants and efficiency of reclamation of contaminated areas and tolerance to salinity of soil and suboptimal temperatures as well as water deficiency. This biotechnology is also useful for biomass enhancement and bio- energy production under suboptimal conditions for more efficient vegetative multiplication of some vegetables and development of sustainable agriculture, forestry, protection of the landscape, and biodiversity. Integration of transdisciplinary cooperation and application of complementary biotechnologies and innovative methods of environmental pollutant bioremediation (such as wastewater treatment) and reclamation, supported by the implementation of a neural network, can optimize bioprocesses that are useful for a better quality of life, globally. Long-term research-developing studies are supplemented by problem-solving training and case studies in different regions (including ecotourism, recreation, and promotion of ecological culture), long distance education and life-long education for the common action of experts and knowledge-based society, promoting sustainable development that is based on integrated biological sciences and sustainable models of consumption.",Dobrowolski J.; Bedla D.; Czech T.; Gambuś F.; Górecka K.; Kiszczak W.; Kuźniar T.; Mazur R.; Nowak A.; Śliwka M.; Tursunov O.; Wagner A.; Wieczorek J.; Zabochnicka-Światek M.,Book,Optimization and Applicability of Bioprocesses,2018-01-02,"Research Institute of Horticulture, Skierniewice;Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu;Uniwersytet Rolniczy im.

"The Adoption of Open Innovation in Large Firms: Practices, Measures, and RisksA survey of large firms examines how firms approach open innovation strategically and manage knowledge flows at the project level.","OVERVIEW: We present a large-sample survey of open innovation adoption and management in large firms, a follow-up to a previous study. We repeat some of the survey measures from the first survey, finding that open innovation continues to be widely practiced in about 80 percent of responding firms. Outside-in open innovation is more often practiced than inside-out. In other words, large firms are net takers of free knowledge flows, in part because they are concerned about IP protection for outbound knowledge. When we added new measures to examine open innovation at the project level, we found that firms selectively manage knowledge flows into and out of projects and are formalizing processes as they move from problem definition to execution. We conclude with observations about the organizational challenges and risks of shifting to an open innovation approach.",Brunswicker S.; Chesbrough H.,Journal,Research Technology Management,2018-01-02,"University of California, Berkeley;Purdue University",Open innovation ;  Survey
Reversing Gears: Inverting the Innovation-Flow Paradigm with Reverse InnovationManaging the drivers of reverse innovation will enable multinational companies to successfully invert the innovation flow.,"OVERVIEW: Addressing resource-constrained customers in emerging markets presents business opportunities beyond local market borders. Multinational corporations can leverage innovations developed for emerging markets to serve customer needs unsatisfied by traditional offerings in developed markets. Little research explores the drivers in the transfer of innovations from emerging to developed markets, a process referred to as reverse innovation. Applying an explorative approach to data drawn from in-depth interviews, archival inquiries, and a manager workshop involving companies from multiple countries and industries, this study derives a comprehensive conceptualization of reverse innovation, proposes a process-oriented approach to reverse innovation, and defines three categories of drivers: structural, cultural, and resource-related. Managing these diverse drivers will enable multinational companies to invert the innovation-flow paradigm successfully.",von Janda S.; Schuhmacher M.; Kuester S.,Journal,Research Technology Management,2018-01-02,Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen;Universität Mannheim,Emerging markets ;  Reverse innovation
Designing medical technology for resilience: integrating health economics and human factors approaches,"Introduction: The slow adoption of innovation into healthcare calls into question the manner of evidence generation for medical technology. This paper identifies potential reasons for this including a lack of attention to human factors, poor evaluation of economic benefits, lack of understanding of the existing healthcare system and a failure to recognise the need to generate resilient products. Areas covered: Recognising a cross-disciplinary need to enhance evidence generation early in a technology’s life cycle, the present paper proposes a new approach that integrates human factors and health economic evaluation as part of a wider systems approach to the design of technology. This approach (Human and Economic Resilience Design for Medical Technology or HERD MedTech) supports early stages of product development and is based on the recent experiences of the National Institute for Health Research London Diagnostic Evidence Co-operative in the UK. Expert commentary: HERD MedTech i) proposes a shift from design for usability to design for resilience, ii) aspires to reduce the need for service adaptation to technological constraints iii) ensures value of innovation at the time of product development, and iv) aims to stimulate discussion around the integration of pre- and post-market methods of assessment of medical technology.",Borsci S.; Uchegbu I.; Buckle P.; Ni Z.; Walne S.; Hanna G.,Journal,Expert Review of Medical Devices,2018-01-02,St Mary's Hospital,clinical pathway mapping ;  clinical usefulness ;  health economics ;  health technology assessment ;  healthcare technology development ;  healthcare technology value proposition ;  human factors ;  Resilience ;  risks ;  usability

CONTEXT-RESPONSIVE MODULAR SYSTEM: A PRAGMATIC SOLUTION FOR SOCIALLY CONSCIOUS ARCHITECTURE,"This study focuses on finding an optimal solution for today's current economic, environmental and demographical issues by creating a modular system that is a pragmatic respond to the present-day issues in a holistic way. It provides a socially responsive architecture that can be modified and updated as the circumstance change in a future time. The main changing parameter that this study is concerned with is “the People”. If there is ever any change in the way people's population or needs or expectations are, that means that a different solution needs to be proposed as the nature of the issue has changed. One of the main issues is the increasing rate of population and urbanization, particularly in Asia and Africa. There is a shortage of housing and this study aims to find a solution that allows Architectural Engineering to address the current issues like energy, economy, health and quality of life in a systematic way. The research was conducted through-out different applied research Quantitative methods including geometrical shape studies, Design data analysis for maximum utilization and parametric space efficiency simulations on different scales. Modularity allows us to simplify the issue and be able to find the correct response by breaking down the problems and solving them in a way that the final outcome is a solution in totality. As a result; this study outcome was a highly efficient-based design for all the living & functional spaces in the built system based on one uniform module that could be arranged in many different units and scales for living spaces.

Through the lenses of the two I’s: Implement or innovate?,"Globally, education has been charged with developing effective teaching and learning innovators who can help to produce much needed high-quality learning systems. This assumes that teaching and learning theories and practices can help to determine appropriate learning outcomes to match this need, and at scale. This cannot be achieved using metrics that accurately pre-determine what a learner will achieve, simply because innovation by its very nature should surprise us. Innovations in education are often regarded with some suspicion, and concerns arise over changes and what losses may result. The assumption in chapters 10 and 11 is that the goal of raising the quality and scale of learning for innovation in education will positively affect education itself and respond to calls for change. The purpose of these two chapters is to present outlines that assist the classification of learning and assessment practices, so that they are pertinent to developing innovators. They discuss the hurdles that educators may face and offer ways to navigate and manage learning that adds clarity of purpose. The originality of the work is in its systemic approach to a long-standing question: do we want learners to copy experts, or do we wish them to challenge norms and provide new innovations to consider and test? Or do we need both? In exposing the hurdles and through the provision of aligned arguments, chapter 11 provides stimulus for thought and further enquiry. The world of work for university graduates has never been more challenging; gone are the long, nurturing careers that offered a ladder of gradual opportunity. Now, students must present themselves to a world of work already sufficiently developed so that their potential value-creating abilities can be seen from day one on the job. This suggests that the role of educating professionals, such as engineers, needs to change in order to prepare students for this increasingly complex world. The nature of such change is contemplated, and a holistic approach that combines existing approaches to engineering and enterprise education is posited. The aim being, to outline a dynamic foundation for graduate learning that supports preparing graduates for the challenges of tomorrow’s unknown. This is a generic concept that can be applied across all areas of education and professional life. It combines creativity, originality, initiative, idea generation, design thinking, adaptability, and reflexivity with problem identification, problem solving, innovation, expression, communication, and practical action. So, the focus is not on directly supporting engineering graduates to commercialize their ideas, but rather, upon initially aiding their development as graduates capable of operating successfully in complex and ever-changing environments. The notion of enterprising engineering graduates is contemplated, the notion of contemporary enterprise is considered, and the possibility of a ‘signature pedagogy’ for enterprise education is discussed. This is followed by consideration of the opportunities to integrate aspects of enterprise education within engineering education, and the tools that could be used to facilitate such a process, drawing attention to the importance of scholarship of teaching and learning as a guiding shadow throughout this process. Over the decades, moments of insight have played a key role in the evolution of technology, but can these ephemeral and enigmatic ‘eureka’ events be managed? In chapter 12, the final chapter of Part 4, we explore the role played by off-task breaks in triggering the unconscious processing of ideas. By breaking up the working day with low effort routine tasks and breaks, individuals can significantly enhance their creativity; taking time away from the job becomes the key link in the creativity process. This research therefore points to the careful management of off-task breaks during the innovation process. Given the role played by the unconscious in creative thought, one clearly cannot manage the direction of thought patterns that emerge. However, one can manage the overall creative process, through the careful management of these unconscious moments. Therefore, walking away from the job is no longer seen as unproductive but an integral aspect of the creative process. This will involve educating educators and managers, and to change the mindset of time-keeping administrators on the importance of breaks. Breaks should no longer be viewed as instances in which employees ‘slack off’ but as an opportunity to enable subconscious thought to come to mind.",Penaluna A.,Book,The Interdisciplinary Future of Engineering Education: Breaking through Boundaries in Teaching and Learning,2018-01-01,,
Performance-based requirements in design-build contracting for highway construction and maintenance,"Design-build contracts with performance-based specifications are believed to raise productivity and the innovation rate. However, performance-based requirements used in specifications for highway and bridge contracts may suffer from being too detailed or too difficult to verify. A Swedish research project has been devoted to this issue. The aims were (i) to develop a definition of performance-based requirements and (ii) to evaluate performance-based requirements used in Swedish design-build contracts. The project consisted of three parts: (i) literature survey, (ii) investigation of current documents produced and used by the Swedish Transport Administration for design-build contracts, and (iii) case studies of six design-build contracts with performance-based requirements, including an analysis of specification documents and interviews with both client and contractor project managers. Current performance-based specifications show different degrees of detail. Measurable requirements are more frequently used on roads, and in particular on road surfaces, than on bridges. Further development is needed to promote technical innovations. Less detailed specifications and a shift to design-build-operate contracts with prolonged maintenance responsibility would also encourage the choice of more durable and long-lasting (=sustainable) solutions. The emphasis on Life Cycle Cost (LCC) in the reformulated contract award criteria in the EU public procurement directive might be insufficient to strengthen the competitive power of concrete pavements as compared to asphalt pavements, unless specifications are supported by Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) and the choice of contract type is reconsidered.",Silfwerbrand J.; Brochner J.,Conference Proceeding,fib Symposium,2018-01-01,The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH);Chalmers University of Technology,Design-build contracting ;  Highway construction ;  Maintenance ;  Performance-based requirements

Contextual Capabilities Meet Human Behaviour Round the peg and square the hole,"To improve environmental wellbeing and productivity, design innovation focuses on human's use-process, evolving individual space to flexible and specialized ones, according to the users` tasks-activity-based. BIM models supports sophisticated behaviours' simulation such as energy, acoustics, although it is not able to manage space use-processes. The present paper rather than a report of a case study or the presentation of a new methodology wants to contribute, together with previous works, in sketching a theroretical framework within which it is possible to compute the interaction between users and spaces (and vice versa). The quest is to reflect on possible paths for engineering knowledge and understanding, providing a BIM system the semantic information required to operate adaptively and achieve robust and innovative goal-directed behavior. Compared to current research on simulation systems, this research approach links Context, intended as spaces capabilities to Actor's Behavioural Knowledge including formalization of personality typologies and profiled behavioural patterns. By means of a classical problem solving metaphor, the ``squared peg in a round hole'' one, multiple categories for goal achievement are sketched, based on reciprocal Actors and Context behaviour adaptation.",Trento A.; Fioravanti A.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International Conference on Education and Research in Computer Aided Architectural Design in Europe,2018-01-01,Sapienza Università di Roma,Behavioural Knowledge ;  Cognitive Computing ;  Use Simulation ;  Use-process Knowledge
Literature Review,"This chapter provides an overview of the research on the relationship between product innovation (especially new product development or NPD) and product safety performance. Few empirical studies investigated the issue of product safety in product innovation.

Developing Global Competencies Through Interdisciplinary Studies: Why Collaboration Is Important Between STEM and Non-STEM Students,"Massification, globalization, and the increasing demand for talented workers in STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Math) fields trouble higher education. The growth of a knowledge economy and changing demand for skills attained at universities are remarkable in STEM fields (Yamada in Redefining Asia Pacific Higher Education in Contexts of Globalization: Private Markets and the Public Good. International and Development Education. Palgrave Pivot, New York, pp. 117–128, 2015). In order to cultivate graduates to lead Japanese industry in collaboration, innovation, and entrepreneurship, policy suggests that technical fields must teach knowledge in the humanities and social sciences. Interdisciplinary studies are valued for the development of critical thinking, a broader perspective from other fields of study, and the ability to translate ways of thought between different fields. This paper shows the direction of interdisciplinary collaboration in US higher education and then analyzes similar developments in Japanese higher education, such as the Empowerment Informatics Ph.D. Program (EMP Program) at the University of Tsukuba.

Evolving an Industrial Digital Ecosystem: A Transformative Case of Leather Industry,"Advances in information technology have made delivering e-content easier to subject experts and to publish on the Web with minimal technical skills and assistance. The development of multimedia e-Learning content is no more labour-intensive process, requiring a team of Web designers and developers responsible for the technical development of these resources, thereby limiting its widespread adoption. Tools such as Adobe Captivate, Camtasia, Snap, Articulate, Lectora, etc., provide an easy way of developing e-contents. This exercise has triggered the idea of creating a knowledge system for an industry, namely leather industry. Digital libraries are large organized collection of digitized objects comprising of texts, images, graphs, data which in new technical terms are referred to as “Big Data”. Well-defined digital software has the potential to disseminate this information worldwide through Internet technologies. The emergence of World Wide Web makes the unprecedented volumes of data freely available to the entire society. This helps in building a domain-specific knowledge portal. The digital economy (also called the Internet economy, the new economy, or the Web economy) is an economy based on digital technologies, including communication networks (the Internet, Intranets, and Extranets), computers, software, and other related technologies. The digital infrastructures provide a global platform over which people and organizations interact, communicate, collaborate, and search for information. Creating new sources of revenue, rationalizing cost structures, enhancing the speed of technology adaptation are considered to be the three wheels of digital ecosystems. Knowledge management is about creating an environment where information can be readily shared. This information is not just the text information but also includes the data at the unit level generated out of research endeavours. Creating a learning organization culture is critical. The Web can now integrate learning and mission-critical business applications while delivering timely knowledge to each desktop. The end result is a knowledge management structure which includes an inventory of knowledge objects and a system in which these can be shared. This is an approach paper to illustrate the content development for a few aspects in leather industry, taking advantage of tools available and a portraying schematically the knowledge portal for this industry. The paper considers knowledge management system (KMS) and the IT tools for leather and allied industry and networking of academic institutes with industries to create knowledge hub and technology innovation centre using digital ecosystem eventually leading to digital transformation.",Anantharaman L.; Sridharan M.,Book Series,Studies in Big Data,2018-01-01,Central Leather Research Institute India,Big data analytics ;  Digital library ;  eBooks ;  Global higher education ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Knowledge portal ;  Rapid content development
"Energy as a Sociotechnical Problem: An Interdisciplinary Perspective on Control, Change, and Action in Energy Transitions","Energy as a Sociotechnical Problem offers an innovative approach to equip interdisciplinary research on sociotechnical transitions with coherence and focus. The book emphasizes sociotechnical problems in three analytical dimensions: - In the control dimension, contributing authors examine how control can be maintained despite increasing complexity and uncertainty, e.g., in power grid operations or on energy markets; - In the change dimension, the authors explore if and how change is possible despite the need for stable orientation, e.g., regarding discourses, real-world labs and learning;- Finally, in the action dimension, the authors analyze how the ability to act on a permanent basis is sustained despite opaqueness and ignorance, exemplified by the work on trust, capabilities or individual motives. Drawing on contributions from engineering, economics, philosophy, political science, psychology and sociology, the book assembles a range of classic and current themes including innovation, resilience, institutional economics, design or education. Energy as a Sociotechnical Problem presents the ongoing transformation of the energy complex as a multidimensional process, in which the analytical dimensions interact with each other in shaping the energy future. As such, this book will be of great interest to students and scholars of energy transitions, energy science and environmental social science more generally, as well as to practitioners working within the field of energy policy.",Büscher C.; Schippl J.; Sumpf P.,Book,"Energy as a Sociotechnical Problem: An Interdisciplinary Perspective on Control, Change, and Action in Energy Transitions",2018-01-01,Karlsruher Institut für Technologie,
Business Models in the Education Technology Industry: What Makes Them Successful?,"This study focuses on business models of education technology firms (i.e., technology providers that enable service innovation in higher education). The purpose of this research is to analyze which choices in business models (concerning customer identification, value delivery, financial aspects and value proposition) foster firm performance—financially and in web and social media. We conduct a complete analysis of education technology firms targeting the higher education market (N = 407). We use databases (e.g., Crunchbase) and firms’ websites to retrieve relevant information in a standardized procedure. The empirical investigations show that most factors (e.g., support) responsible for business model success in the education technology industry are related to the firms’ services. This study is the first to systematically evaluate the business models of education technology firms and among the first studies to address the influence of business models on firm performance.",Wendler W.; Stumpf-Wollersheim J.; Welpe I.,Conference Proceeding,ICIS 2017: Transforming Society with Digital Innovation,2018-01-01,"TUM School of Management, Munich;Technische Universität Bergakademie Freiberg",Business model ;  Education technology ;  Firm performance ;  Service industry
Manufacturing with a big M – The Grand Challenges of Engineering in Digital Societies from the Perspective of the Institute for Manufacturing at Cambridge University,"Engineering used to be driven by a community of experts who set themselves apart from others by establishing clear boundaries of their profession. Today, however, these boundaries have become increasingly permeable, due to the increasing dynamic and complexity of technical and economic change. The manufacturing sector illustrates this process very well. Engineering is currently becoming much more deeply involved in the usage of technical artefacts and economic questions of value creation. Engineers are therefore facing the challenge of opening up their traditional domain to collaborate with other disciplines and integrate new knowledge in their theories, concepts and procedures. This contribution shows how the Institute for Manufacturing at Cambridge University copes with this challenge, expanding the scope of topics addressed in engineering and introducing new subjects in the curriculum of the students. All this seems to be a necessary prerequisite for engineers to uphold their claims of responsibility of technical development and their contribution to well-being in society.",Neely A.; Fell S.; Fritzsche A.,Book Series,Philosophy of Engineering and Technology,2018-01-01,University of Cambridge;Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg,Engineering education ;  Innovation ;  Manufacturing ;  Service research ;  Well-being
Innovation training and entrepreneurship in french engineering higher education institutions: An investigation of the commission des titres d’ingénieur,"This chapter presents the approach adopted for the investigation and an overview of the responses provided by the higher education institutions. Commission des Titres d’Ingénieur (CTI) associates the problem of innovation with that of entrepreneurship, considering that this link is relevant in a didactic perspective within educational activities. Evaluation of the openness to innovation must be supported by concrete productions, verifiable within institutions, which will allow the development of a state of mind and the implementation of specific activities and projects. From a pedagogical point of view, active pedagogies are unanimously recommended, unlike lectures about entrepreneurship. The development of innovation through undertaking internships in research laboratories in France seems currently less obvious. Some institutions work together with a management or design institution for example, and this transdisciplinary approach leads to very beneficial conditions, especially in the framework of common projects between the students.",Jolly A.; Nolland J.,Book,Training Engineers for Innovation,2018-01-01,Commission des Titres d'Ingénieur,Active pedagogies ;  CTI ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Higher education institutions ;  Openness to innovation

Higher Education Research in Mongolia During the Transition Period of Development,"The first higher education institution (HEI) in Mongolia was established in 1942. During the transition period from a centralized economy to a market economy, which began in the early 1990s, there was a marked increase in the number of HEIs. Mining, construction, transport, and communication have become the fastest-growing sectors; they have potential absorptive capacity for the younger population and demand technical, vocational, and engineering skills. The changing socioeconomic context has introduced progress and innovation in higher education; however, we have also faced some emerging problems and challenges. This has stimulated increased demand for higher educational research, and we here outline the current landscape of higher education as a research field in Mongolia on the basis of the quantity and themes of published journal articles and monographs. We reviewed the Mongolian Foundation for Science and Technology (MFST) database, which was established in 1993, as well as some academic journals that publish peer-reviewed, research-based, discipline-specific articles. The journals do not focus specifically on higher education, but they occasionally include articles related to higher education research. State-owned universities play a key role in such research; therefore, the summary of annual academic publications by faculty members and researchers of those universities is a reasonable source of information to find relevant articles. We reviewed 380 publications, most of which were related to common problems of higher education in Mongolia, such as educational policy, capacity building, faculty development, etc. In their conclusions and recommendations, the authors of the studies primarily stated that education management and human resource development, training methods, and content must be improved. We concluded that higher education research is in its initial stage of development and that its role as a field of science, in planning for future actions, in evaluating the results and outcomes of interventions and changes in higher education, and in providing policy developers and decision-makers with scientific evidence, is increasing.",Sumberzul N.; Oyunbileg S.,Book Series,Higher Education in Asia,2018-01-01,Mongolian National University of Medical Sciences,Higher education ;  Higher education research ;  Higher educational institutions
Designing and building a 3D printed low cost modular Raman spectrometer,"Raman spectroscopy is broadly used in both industrial and academic communities, including nanotechnology, biology, materials engineering, physics, pharmaceutical industry and environment protection monitoring. Most of these devices are worth thousands of dollars and usually require a PhD-level assistant to operate them, hence they are usually not available for college and undergraduate students. The present paper describes an affordable, easy-to-use, Raman spectrometer that can be built with commercially available electronics and optics and 3D printing. A Crossed Czerny Turner spectrometer optical configuration has been built with a linear CCD module driven by a Nucleo F401RE and Raspberry Pi. Raman spectra of Rhodamine B liquid was obtained. We propose that this system could make it easier for universities to build and use an affordable, effective, easy-to-use, Raman spectrometer for educational purposes. Introducing this technology to students with an affordable, easy-to-use, device as early as possible would help universities and colleges to draw attention to studying science. Further research into the development of affordable and effective Raman spectrometers has the potential to pave the way for broadening the application of this technology in more innovative ways in the daily lives of future residents of smart cities.",Aydogan O.; Tasal E.,Journal,CERN IdeaSquare Journal of Experimental Innovation,2018-01-01,Eskişehir Osmangazi Üniversitesi,3D printing ;  Experimental innovation ;  Raman spectrometer ;  Raman spectroscopy
"A Nanoinformatics Approach to Safety, Health, Well-Being, and Productivity","The context of nanoinformatics is that effective development and implementation of nanotechnology requires the harnessing of information to support innovation and decision-making at the nexus of safety, health, well-being, and productivity; risk management; and the emerging nanotechnology. The working definition of nanoinformatics has evolved to be determining which information is relevant to meeting the safety, health, well-being, and productivity objectives of the nanoscale science and engineering community; developing and implementing effective mechanisms for collecting, validating, storing, sharing, analyzing, modeling, and applying the information; confirming that appropriate decisions were made and that desired mission outcomes were achieved as a result of that information; and finally conveying experience to the broader community, contributing to generalized knowledge and updating standards and training. The diverse individuals who are engaged in nanoinformatics can be viewed as fitting across four categories of methods and data roles and responsibilities: customers (who specify the scientific applications and characterization methods and data needs for their intended purposes), creators (who develop relevant and reliable methods and data to meet the nanoscale science and engineering community customers' needs), curators (who maintain and ensure the quality of the methods and sensor data), and analysts (who develop and apply methods and models for data analysis and interpretation that are consistent with the quality and quantity of the data and that meet customers' needs). Although the same individuals sometimes perform all four roles, many individuals typically interact over significant distances, organizations, and time. We can all work together to foster sound knowledge management and informatics tools that can support the rational design of nanomaterials and products, prioritization of research, and assessment of risk across the nanoproduct life cycle.",Hoover M.; Cash L.; Feitshans I.; Hendren C.; Harper S.,Book,"Nanotechnology Environmental Health and Safety: Risks, Regulation, and Management",2018-01-01,Pratt School of Engineering;Oregon State University;Los Alamos National Laboratory;National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health;International Law of Nanotechnology;Work Health and Survival Project,hierarchy of controls ;  informatics ;  life cycle ;  nanoinformatics
Lidar or imagery – Which to choose?,"Over the past few years there has been extensive innovation in Geospatial technologies that can be used in revolutionary new ways in order to accurately and efficiently map and assess transportation assets. Significant investments in R&D and the race amongst auto manufacturers towards making connected and autonomous vehicles a reality has been instrumental in facilitating a rapid evolution of how spatial data is collected, processed and turned into usable intelligent transportation asset information. There are a number of sensors and information systems that transportation asset managers can leverage in order to manage their assets. Amongst this plethora of technologies, both LiDAR and Imaging provide some of the most important and accurate foundational mapping information regarding the assets and features in the transportation sector. Advanced sensor technologies in combination with artificial intelligence, machine learning and integrated information systems provide significant opportunities for improvements and efficiencies in the collection of data as it relates to transportation asset management. This presentation will discuss some of the differences between LiDAR and Imaging, some of the different systems that are being used to collect these different types of spatial data and how transportation asset information is accurately and effectively extracted and derived from each type of data that these respective technologies produce. The presentation will provide a high level overview of the technical differences between the two technologies and data they produce along with some insight on the fundamental differences in how asset data is then produced. With this insight, transportation asset managers will have deeper understanding of which technology should be chosen for a particular application or in different settings. Ultimately the transportation asset manager will come away with more perspective on how and where these technologies fit within the overall full asset management life cycle and how to effectively leverage these technologies within their asset portfolios. As part of a comprehensive discussion, price and cost must also be included. Insight will be provided for why quotes can vary significantly from one vendor to another for the same scope of work. From this, transportation asset managers will be equipped with more insight and understanding of what the drivers are for pricing of these services. The presentation at the conference will provide a concise overview along with thought provoking visual aids. The transportation asset manager will leave the presentation with a clear understanding of the principles and concepts discussed in this paper.",Davis K.,Conference Proceeding,"Transportation Association of Canada Conference - Innovation and Technology: Evolving Transportation, TAC 2018",2018-01-01,WSP Global Inc.,

Service-learning in civil engineering education: New experience in the field of road safety,"Service-learning is an educational experience in which students participate in an organized service activity that meets identified community needs and reflect on the service activity in such a way as to gain further understanding of the course content and enhanced sense of civic responsibility. This new methodology has the potential to address many of the issues facing civil engineering education: can clearly enhance classroom learning, promote project based curricula and increase students´ retention of knowledge. Despite the numerous benefits of service-learning in civil engineering education, little research has been done to date to evaluate this new pedagogy; and until now, literature is focused on the limited experiences of Engineers without Borders, organizations which promote and facilitate the integration of international service projects into local engineering curricula. In terms of road safety, the prevention tools and the management of the traffic accidents is a discipline that can be better understood through the road victims´ associations. Working with victims´ associations can help to better understand the accident risk indicators, the types of injuries caused by these accidents and their physical and legal consequences. This paper contributes to this limited literature by assessing the positive and negative experiences encountered by students when undertaking a service-learning project for the first time. The methodology was tested on a survey sample of 61 students enrolled in the “Traffic Management” module in the Civil Engineering Master’s degree at the Technical University of Madrid (UPM). Students were organized in groups of 6 and 7 members and each group was assigned with a road accident victims´ association in order to develop a case study during four weeks. This pilot experience has been supported by Spain's Directorate General of Traffic (Dirección General de Tráfico) and by UPM, as part of the 2016-2017 Competitive Funding Programme for Educational Innovation Projects (IE1617-0401).",Guirao B.; Bau-Pous M.; Casado-Sanz N.,Conference Proceeding,EUCEET 2018 - 4th International Conference on Civil Engineering Education: Challenges for the Third Millennium,2018-01-01,Universidad Politécnica de Madrid,Civil Engineering ;  Education ;  Ethic skills ;  Road safety ;  Service-Learning
TRIZ-Based Approach for Process Intensification and Problem Solving in Process Engineering: Concepts and Research Agenda,"Process engineering (PE) focuses on the design, operation, control and optimization of chemical, physical and biological processes and has applications in many industries. Process intensification (PI) is the key development approach in the modern process engineering. The theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ) is today considered as the most comprehensive and systematically organized invention knowledge and creative thinking methodology. This paper analyses the opportunities of TRIZ application in PE and especially in combination with PI. In this context the paper outlines the major challenges for TRIZ application in PE, conceptualizes a possible TRIZ-based approach for process intensification and problem solving in PE, and defines the corresponding research agenda. It also presents the results of the original empirical innovation research in the field of solid handling in the ceramic industry, demonstrates a method for identification and prediction of contradictions and introduces the concept of the probability of contradiction occurrence. Additionally, it describes a technique of process mapping that is based on the function and multi-screen analysis of the processes. This technique is illustrated by a case study dealing with granulation process. The research work presented in this paper is a part of the European project “Intensified by Design® platform for the intensification of processes involving solids handling”.",Casner D.; Livotov P.; Mas’udah.; da Silva P.,Book,"Advances and Impacts of the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving: The TRIZ Methodology, Tools and Case Studies",2018-01-01,University of Applied Sciences Offenburg,
"SERVING STUDENTS, FACULTY, AND NOTICE: STUDENT COOPERATION, FACULTY COLLABORATION, AND INSTITUTIONAL COUNTER-NARRATION AT A SOUTHERN FLAGSHIP HBCU","As historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) endeavor to establish niches in the higher education marketplace, we see a surfeit of HBCU executives, administrators, alumni, faculty, and student voices leading the public discourse about how twenty-first century solutions are being sought to serve the needs of an increasingly ethnically and culturally diverse educational sector. Journalistic missives and research produced in academia examine and often define HBCUs struggling to garner federal/external research dollars, struggling to attract, engage, and support diverse student populations, lacking innovation, failing to promote and foster cooperation and interdisciplinarity, and failing to promote esprit de corps among faculty. These missives are often the result of externally produced news stories which permeate because of a lack of engagement among traditional media outlets and journalists with “on-the-ground” thought leaders working with HBCU students and students themselves. Featuring the collaborative efforts of racially diverse faculty from multiple disciplines, producing research and providing service to racially, culturally, and geographically diverse students, the student service-based research project discussed in the chapter aims to provide differential academic and employment-support services to transition HBCU students with learning disabilities leading to improved college completion and employment outcome by emphasizing cooperation in the classroom and through extracurricular activities. Further, it accomplishes something equally critical to its researchbased outcomes a model of collaboration and cooperation other HBCUs should seek to replicate for the sake of its students, faculty, and institutional reputations. The program described in this chapter is just one example of programs that serve students and exemplify the mission of HBCUs, while demonstrating innovation, collaboration, and leadership, that creates an opportunity to counter-narrate pernicious stereotypes about HBCUs. The federally-funded, innovative student services/success program I examine in this chapter a collaborative, multidepartment, and interdisciplinary program emphasizing cooperative learning at a southern flagship HBCU challenges these pernicious narratives head on. Raising attention and awareness of the program’s existence is important not only to highlight the university’s attempts to promote student success, but is also another clarion call for HBCUs to do all within their power to promote their own successes at attracting, retaining, and promoting students’ success while finding creative ways to develop faculty and promote interdisciplinarity and collaboration. Doing so benefits all HBCU students regardless of their race, cultural affinities, or level of preparedness for college, and benefits all faculty, be they in the much-vaunted science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields or often lesser-valued, but equally crucial fields in the humanities, education, and the arts.",Broussard W.,Book Series,Diversity in Higher Education,2018-01-01,,collaboration ;  cooperation ;  counter-narrative ;  faculty development ;  HBCU student success ;  student support
"Operating management system for high reliability: Leadership, accountability, learning and innovation in healthcare","The healthcare industry is on the journey toward high reliability. The industry works diligently to improve safety and quality, adopting some vitally important high reliability organization practices. While positive steps forward, these practices tend to be discrete initiatives to address specific challenges, and high reliability remains elusive. The journey taught us to view quality and safety not as a project, or even a portfolio of projects, but as an integrated operating management system. We are learning from industries that are further along on the high reliability organization journey, especially those compelled by widely publicized mishaps. These industries developed international consensus standards for integrated management systems to assure operational safety, quality, and reliability. Healthcare needs to evolve accordingly. Our work is informed by advanced systems engineering and mission assurance methodology, and research in high reliability organizing. The operating management system fosters two fundamental ways of working. First, it organizes processes and practices using a systems engineering approach to anticipate and reduce risks, mindfully standardizing work to prevent mishaps and improve performance. Second, it creates a culture of systems thinking and collaboration, building resiliency to recover from mishaps, when they occur, and promote mindful variation to deal effectively with unexpected situations. We share our motivation and approach to developing the operating management system, implementation examples and results achieved. While there is currently a large gap between idealized, highly reliable operations and current practice in healthcare, our experience demonstrates the benefits of this integrated systems management approach to address contemporary challenges and advance on the journey toward high reliability.",Day R.; Demski R.; Pronovost P.; Sutcliffe K.; Kasda E.; Maragakis L.; Paine L.; Sawyer M.; Winner L.,Journal,Journal of Patient Safety and Risk Management,2018-01-01,Whiting School of Engineering;Johns Hopkins Carey Business School;UnitedHealth Group;Johns Hopkins School of Nursing;Johns Hopkins Medicine;The Johns Hopkins Hospital;Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine,High reliability ;  High reliability organization ;  Management system ;  Operating management system ;  Quality ;  Systems engineering
Innovative or derivative? The design of the bridge structures on the world’s first intercity railway between liverpool and manchester,"The Liverpool and Manchester Railway is well-known as the world’s first intercity railway, introducing a global transport revolution. Most research has focused on the triumph of the steam locomotive in the Rainhill trials. In comparison the design and construction of the civil engineering infrastructure have been neglected. The line featured over 60 bridges and viaducts.

From invention to production: The introduction of prestressed concrete,"How do new production methods resulting from inventions develop into practical applications? This case describes the innovation process for prestressed concrete in Denmark from 1939–52. This was achieved through new materials, new production machinery, changed calculation methods, new approval systems of the authorities, and new organizational frameworks around planning. Knowledge was dispersed mainly from Germany and France, and secondarily from Belgium and Sweden. Danish research played no major role. However, there was a lively exchange of experience among engineers. Dr. Techn. Christen Ostenfeld played a special role; he became acquainted with the French developer of prestressed concrete, Eugène Freyssinet. In 1941, Ostenfeld got Freyssinet to design a major bridge. It was not realized, but it resulted in licenses on Freyssinet’s patents coming to Denmark. Ostenfeld’s consulting and engineering firm (today known as COWI) grew in parallel with the use of prestressed concrete, including the construction of silos around Europe.",Burchardt J.,Conference Proceeding,"Building Knowledge, Constructing Histories",2018-01-01,National Museum of Science and Technology,80 ;  Bridges ;  Denmark ;  Innovation process ;  Large Scale Structures ;  Pre-stressed concrete 1928 ;  Standards
Towards an integrated approach for modelling product-service systems: Status quo and future challenges,"Product-Service Systems (PSS) are a well-established approach that holds great promises for sustainable business success. However, continuous changes such as technological innovations constitute novel challenges for the development and the offering of PSS. As these challenges become more and more diverse and complex, single companies, especially SME, are often not able to handle this level of complexity and involve further multidisciplinary expertise in PSS design. While prior research mostly focuses on a tighter integration of the product and service domain, there is a lack of integrated approaches that consider even further disciplines like software, mechanical or electrical engineering. Accordingly, this study aims to explore how conceptual models such as process models can be applied as a basis for combining various domains to contribute to the development of new PSS. Therefore, we specified corresponding problems and challenges that motivate our work and report first results of our research project.",Hagen S.; Schoormann T.; Jannaber S.; Knackstedt R.; Thomas O.,Conference Proceeding,"Lecture Notes in Informatics (LNI), Proceedings - Series of the Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI)",2018-01-01,Osnabrück University;Universität Hildesheim,Conceptual modelling ;  Method engineering ;  Product-service systems

"Silica and clay dispersed polymer nanocomposites: Preparation, properties and applications","The production of ‘polymer nanocomposites’ has recently gained considerable attention from both the academic and industrial community, especially in the area of nanoscience. This is mainly due to their enhanced improvements in physico-mechanical, thermal and barrier properties compared to micro and more conventional composites. Their nanoscale dimensions, biodegradable character, cost-effectiveness and sustainability have constituted a stimulus for this increasing interest. Currently there is no limit to the possibility of applications. However, despite all this progress, it is still difficult to achieve uniform dispersion between the filler and the matrix, as agglomerations form far too easily and the production of polymer nanocomposites with high mechanical and thermal properties is still limited. The authors of this proposed book, are of the opinion, that with the increase in scientific publications and the rapid progress in processing possibilities to produce nanocomposites based on various nanoscale fillers (silica/clay), a book that collects all of these scientific findings in one place would be timely and of great interest to both students and scientific researchers, who are concerned with the production, and application of nanocomposites as new innovative materials. The authors aim is to present the latest research findings on the fabrication, properties and applications of nanofillers as reinforcement in polymer nanocomposites. Particular emphasis will be placed on the introduction of various nanofillers (silica/clay) into different elastomeric polymer matrices that will enhance the properties of these materials and their applications. The book will provide an up-to-date review of major innovations in the field and act as a reference for future research in materials science and engineering, which is highly topical due to the demand to produce more sustainable and eco-friendly innovative advanced materials from elastomeric polymers.",Rahman M.,Book,"Silica and Clay Dispersed Polymer Nanocomposites: Preparation, Properties and Applications",2018-01-01,Universiti Malaysia Sarawak,
Bioactive metallic surfaces for bone tissue engineering,"Metals and their alloys have played a main role as structural biomaterials in reconstructive surgical procedures, particularly orthopedics, with more recent uses in nonosseous tissues, such as blood vessels. Recently, there has been an increasing trend in research focusing on improving the performance of the biomedical implants. The clinicians used metallic implants to treat bone imperfections and fractures. Currently metallic biomaterials like stainless steel, Co-Cr alloys, Ti and its alloys are being used significantly as implantable biomaterials for their good mechanical properties, but they failed to prove long-term durability and did not build a sufficient bond with human bone. Since human tissue is structured mainly of self-assembled polymers (proteins) and ceramics (bone minerals), with metals present as trace elements with molecular scale functions, the necessity for innovation and development of smart bioactive materials, which can generate a chemical bond with bones, with improved functional and biocompatible properties, either by employing surface engineering or through improving process parameters has been felt for application.

Fostering prefabrication in construction projects—case mep in finland,"Prefabrication increases construction project performance. However, the construction sector has not widely adopted it in Finland. This study focuses on understanding the barriers, enablers, value addition, and value capture of different construction project stakeholders when implementing mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) prefabrication. Based on a literature study and semi-structured interviews, the paper proposes that the implementation of MEP prefabrication should be seen as a challenge of implementing a systemic innovation. The implementation of a systemic innovation necessitates the buy-in of main project stakeholders, namely the owner, designers, general contractor, MEP sub-contractors, and MEP fabricator. This study provides evidence of the value added activities of each stakeholder to implement MEP prefabrication. The study implies that MEP prefabrication can be a ‘win-win’ situation for all stakeholders of a project network, which at its best, can be described as a project ecosystem. The research proposes ways to boost MEP prefabrication in construction projects.",Lavikka R.; Chauhan K.; Peltokorpi A.; Seppänen O.,Conference Proceeding,"eWork and eBusiness in Architecture, Engineering and Construction - Proceedings of the 12th European Conference on Product and Process Modelling, ECPPM 2018",2018-01-01,Aalto University,
Addressing global protein demand through diversification and innovation: An introduction to plant-based and clean meat,"Protein is an essential component of the human diet. Yet our hunger for protein, particularly in developed countries where protein has long been synonymous with meat, has led to methods of protein production through large-scale industrial animal agriculture that are damaging to global health, environmental sustainability, and food security. As the world’s population continues to expand to near ten billion people by 2050 and increasing wealth in developing countries adds to the demand for animal protein, we must answer an urgent question: how can we produce safe, healthy, and affordable protein sources for human consumption through systems that do not negatively impact people and the planet? The answer to this question will necessarily involve diversification of - and innovation within - the protein sources and manufacturing practices utilized to produce high-quality protein foods. This chapter introduces two promising solutions to sustainably satisfy this growing protein demand: plant-based meat and clean meat. We define what these protein sources are, how they are produced, and the research and development challenges to address if we are to transform these industries into the foundation of a healthy, humane, and sustainable global food system.",Clayton E.; Specht E.; Welch D.; Berke A.,Book,Encyclopedia of Food Chemistry,2018-01-01,The Good Food Institute,Cell culture ;  Cellular agriculture ;  Clean meat ;  Extrusion ;  Meat alternative ;  Meat analogue ;  Plant-based meat ;  Protein ;  Sustainability ;  Tissue engineering
Self-sensing and self-healing 'smart' cement-based materials- A review of the state of the art,"The paper reviews recent research on self-sensing and self-healing cement-based materials as part of Smart Civil Engineering Infrastructures. Incorporated in Structural Health Monitoring systems, these materials are likely to play an important role in making future infrastructure robust, resilient and sustainable. Smart or intelligent cement-based materials have attracted extensive attention in the last decade or so with strong implications for improving structural durability and service life. Additions of carbon fibres, carbon nano-tubes and various nano-powders giving cement-based matrix electrical properties used for self-sensing have been known for over a decade and a half. In addition, the strong capacity of Strain-Hardening Cement-based Composites (SHCC) for autogenous healing is aided by tight crack-width control, and the application of different mineral and bio-additive based materials to accelerate autonomic self-healing of cracks have been noted with great interest. Monitoring of the durability of concrete structures is often neglected in favour of the structural safety against catastrophic failure. The present review summarizes the latest literature with a focus on identifying and documenting key innovations and field applications, and the performance based design approach to tailoring material solutions for long service life, sustainability and resiliency. Smart infrastructures including Smart Buildings and Smart Cities are being constructed at an increasing pace around the world. One of the major driving force is the explosion of low-cost Internet-enabled sensors as part of the new wave of 'Internet of Things (IoT)'. At a fraction of the cost that is being invested into the latest IoT products for incrementally more comfortable living space, a much more resilient and sustainable infrastructure can be ensured by investing in commercialization of self-sensing and self-healing materials. For this to happen the research community need to identify the gaps between the 'Industry Pull' and 'Technology Push' first instead of inventing solutions waiting for a problem.",Mishra D.; Yu J.; Leung C.,Conference Proceeding,"6th International Conference on Durability of Concrete Structures, ICDCS 2018",2018-01-01,KMBB College of Engineering and Technology;Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,Durability ;  High performance cement composites ;  Infrastructure ;  Self-healing ;  Self-sensing ;  Smart concrete
"Nanotechnology Environmental Health and Safety—Learning From the Past, Preparing for the Future","The last decade of progress—and challenges—in nanotechnology environmental health and safety (EHS) has provided a glimpse of what the future of the chemicals and materials industries may hold. As materials become more sophisticated and our manufacturing methods become more decentralized and responsive to consumer timescales, we must recognize that our approaches to risk assessment, regulation, and management must similarly adapt in a timely, responsive, and cost-effective manner. The third edition of Hull and Bowman builds on the knowledge base established by our previous two editions and includes new content reflective of both the rapidly changing pace of nanotechnology-enabled research and development and its subsequent integration into society. The book continues its role as the world's foremost resource addressing the breadth of issues surrounding the EHS implications of nanoscale science and engineering by thoroughly explaining EHS issues, financial implications, foreseeable risks (i.e., exposure, dose, hazards of nanomaterials), state-of-the-science, and the implications of occupational hygiene precautions and consumer protections. We continue to ponder how society will extract the benefits of nanotechnology while minimizing real and perceived risks. We also introduce a range of timely questions: How do we avoid becoming complacent about nanotechnology EHS risks as nanoenabled systems continue to emerge and increase in sophistication? How do we streamline risk assessment and management as the pace of innovation continues to accelerate and technologies converge? How do we incentivize responsible innovation to address global challenges in a timely way? The chapters comprising the third edition of Hull and Bowman consider these questions through the experiences of representatives from academia, Fortune 500 corporations, entrepreneurs, insurers, nanotechnology facility managers, and experts in product liability. Authors not only cross disciplines and fields but also jurisdictions to bring together a state-of-the-art and balanced discussion of the emerging global nanotechnology EHS landscape. And rather than simply posing questions, this edited volume continues to offer practical strategies developed to manage these risks in nanotechnology facilities of varying size and complexity.",Hull M.; Bowman D.,Book,"Nanotechnology Environmental Health and Safety: Risks, Regulation, and Management",2018-01-01,Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University;Arizona State University Downtown Phoenix Campus,Advanced materials ;  Consumer safety ;  Environment ;  Hazard ;  Nano ;  Nanomaterial ;  Nanotechnology ;  Occupational ;  Product liability ;  Risk ;  Safety ;  Sustainability ;  Workplace

Proce ess options for a sewage lagoon in subarctic Canada,"The existing sewage lagoon for the community of Fort Resolution, Northwest Territories is located in a waste management area approximately 1.5 kilometres north of the community centre. The sewage lagoon is a facultative/infiltration process consisting of seven cells of various sizes linked by channels. The treatment system begins at a truck discharge point into a cell, and wastewater ultimately percolates through the sandy soil in a northerly direction to a wetland area in the Slave Lake delta approximately 400 metres from site. Detention in the lagoon, and the infiltration process through the sandy soil provides treatment to an secondary level of effluent quality. In 2008, it was anticipated that the sewage lagoon was approaching the end of its sen/ice life with its current configuration, as indicated by decreasing available freeboard in the cells. A Waste Management Planning Study was completed, which recommended the construction of a new lagoon to meet the twenty-year wastewater generation demand. The report presented 2 options: A facultative infiltration process, and a retention process. It was recommended that a facultative/infiltration lagoon be advanced, but it was recognized that this option may not receive regulatory approval. Based upon the ongoing concerns with the performance and operation of a facultative infiltration lagoon system, and regulatory feedback, a decision was made to advance the design of a lined retention lagoon. Preliminary engineering was advanced on the new lagoon system in 2017, and a comparison of various configurations of a retention lagoon were considered. These configurations included a single lined cell, two lined cells with primary and secondary cells, and three lined cells with a polishing filter. The three cell configuration was a recent process innovation proposed as a result of a comprehensive research program on northern lagoon systems. Based on cost and the anticipated performance information on the lagoon systems, the two-cell lagoon process configuration proposed was confirmed to be the most appropriate option for Fort Resolution. The capacity of the proposed sewage lagoon is 31,000 m3 based on the sewage generation projection. The design and construction of the two cell process configuration is scheduled to be completed in 2018.",Johnson K.,Conference Proceeding,"CSCE General Conference 2018, Held as Part of the Canadian Society for Civil Engineering Annual Conference 2018",2018-01-01,"Stantec Inc., Canada",
'Extending the boundaries: Bismuth-based pigments for the plastics industry',"The versatile solid-state chemistry of Bismuth allows for a variety of coordination complexes and the generation of new and robust inorganic pigments as a result. Bismuth has been used in combination with a few inorganic elements, and is most readily found as complexes containing amines and amides, alkoxides, carboxylates, thiolates, and halides. Bismuth Nitrate is amongst one of the most common starting materials for synthesizing Bismuth complexes, and from this starting material the first Bismuth Vanadate pigments (PY.184) were formulated in the mid 1970s [1,2]. There has been continued innovation in this pigment chemistry over the years, and in 2015 a groundbreaking Bismuth orange with a unique color index, PO.86, was launched (proprietary technology of DCC). Since their commercial introduction in 1990 (first production for Ciba, The Netherlands) into the coatings & plastics markets, Bismuth Vanadate pigments have increased in importance as their field of application has grown. These bright yellow, highly saturated pigments are characterized by their outstanding opacity/hiding power, chemical resistance, excellent weathering and durability. DCC's 3rd innovative generation of Bismuth Vanadate pigments have expanded the limitations of this chemistry to cover a wider color gamut from greenish-yellow to orange hues. Advances such as improving the heat stability has increased the utilization of Bismuth Vanadate products in engineering resins e.g. Nylon 6. Increasing the color strength has created value in use for many customers who want to use less pigment whilst maintaining the hiding power within their system. Moreover, introducing Stir-In technology has helped to reduce operating costs by making the pigment easier to disperse, therefore reducing pressure rise in the extruder and reducing the number of extruder screen changes required during production. Improvements in our manufacturing technologies have allowed DCC to attain the most demanding and specific performance attributes such as heat stability & dispersibility. Through intensive research DCC has been able to introduce an exciting new inorganic pigment into the market, based on Bismuth and identified by a new color index: PO.86 [3]. This clean yellow shade inorganic orange has outstanding hiding power, typical of inorganic pigments and represents an excellent starting base for orange colour matches. Additionally, PO.86 is non-warping and has very good heat stability (up to 250 °C): it is therefore strongly recommended for use in polyolefin based plastics, and architectural, industrial, powder, automotive & coil coating applications. There are only a few options for formulators in this shade area (most of which are based on organic starting materials), but none of these alternatives have the same level of durability and opacity as PO.86. This paper will illustrate how Bismuth Vanadate and Bismuth Orange pigments compare to other colorants in the green shade yellow to orange shade areas, with particular reference to performance attributes such as heat stability, dispersibility, weather-fastness, warp resistance and reference how these products perform in different polymer systems. This presentation is thus ideal for those who work & formulate with color and would like to develop a greater understanding of how PY.184 and PO.86 pigments influence the plastics they work with.",Zanzottera C.; Hamers H.; Howie B.,Conference Proceeding,"Annual Technical Conference - ANTEC, Conference Proceedings",2018-01-01,,
The construction of meaning in design-driven projects,"The cornerstone in design-driven innovation is the creation of new meanings – the creation of a holistic, creative result meaningful to its users. However, despite an increasing interest in this field, the process of how meaning is constructed is still a neglected area in design and innovation management research. This paper explores how five Danish companies in diverse industries constructed new product meanings. The study indicates: that innovation of meaning starts from the designer’s personal experience with a paradox in an existing product-user relationship, that a vital part of meaning construction is the user’s experience of the product, and that meaning is constructed from a number of different frames.",Knudsen L.; Haase L.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Engineering Design, ICED",2018-01-01,Aalborg University,Design-driven innovation ;  Framing ;  Meaning-making
Proactive Empirical Assessment of New Language Feature Adoption via Automated Refactoring: The Case of Java 8 Default Methods,"Programming languages and platforms improve over time, sometimes resulting in new language features that offer many benefits. However, despite these benefits, developers may not always be willing to adopt them in their projects for various reasons. In this paper, we describe an empirical study where we assess the adoption of a particular new language feature. Studying how developers use (or do not use) new language features is important in programming language research and engineering because it gives designers insight into the usability of the language to create meaning programs in that language. This knowledge, in turn, can drive future innovations in the area. Here, we explore Java 8 default methods, which allow interfaces to contain (instance) method implementations. Default methods can ease interface evolution, make certain ubiquitous design patterns redundant, and improve both modularity and maintainability. A focus of this work is to discover, through a scientific approach and a novel technique, situations where developers found these constructs useful and where they did not, and the reasons for each. Although several studies center around assessing new language features, to the best of our knowledge, this kind of construct has not been previously considered. Despite their benefits, we found that developers did not adopt default methods in all situations. Our study consisted of submitting pull requests introducing the language feature to 19 real-world, open source Java projects without altering original program semantics. This novel assessment technique is proactive in that the adoption was driven by an automatic refactoring approach rather than waiting for developers to discover and integrate the feature themselves. In this way, we set forth best practices and patterns of using the language feature effectively earlier rather than later and are able to possibly guide (near) future language evolution. We foresee this technique to be useful in assessing other new language features, design patterns, and other programming idioms.",Khatchadourian R.; Masuhara H.,Journal,"Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming",2018-01-01,Institute of Science Tokyo;The Graduate Center;Hunter College,default methods ;  empirical study ;  java ;  skeletal implementation pattern
Boosting innovation for the development of smart-service factories of the future: The cases of the federal state of Vorarlberg and its neighbouring regions,"Factory of the Future is an initiative of the European Commission. It is highly narrative and describes the transformation of “ordinary” manufacturing operations and structures to fully-integrated cyber-physical manufacturing systems. Basing on case study research performed in the greater area of Vorarlberg, this article aims to explore how Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the field of manufacturing can evolve to smart-service Factories of the Future. It takes a mixed-methods approach with quantitative research (questionnaire) and qualitative case study interviews and provides findings about three main topics in service system engineering: “transformation of an operational need into a description of system performance parameters”, “integration of related technical parameters and assurance of compatibility of all physical, functional and program interfaces” and “integration of reliability, maintainability, safety, survivability, human and other such factors”. As it turns out, increased servitization measures, service management, service performance and service quality by development of service-oriented architectures (SOA) are key to evolve to a smart-service Factory of the Future.",Maurer F.; Fritzsche A.,Conference Proceeding,"31st Bled eConference: Digital Transformation: Meeting the Challenges, BLED 2018",2018-01-01,Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg;HOCHSCHULSTRASSE,Digital transformation ;  Factory of the future ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Service science ;  Smart-service systems
Situational requirement engineering in global software development,"In global software development (GSD), teams from different geographies are involved in software development activities from requirement till management phase. There are many potential benefits associated with GSD environment such as development cost, round the clock development, accessibility to better skilled people and many others. Although, organizations are achieving the benefits of GSD but its challenging nature such as cultural and language differences, trust relationship, coordination and communication is introducing numerous challenges that cannot be ignored. These challenges are significantly influencing requirement engineering (RE) process in GSD. One of the reasons behind challenging nature of RE in GSD is varying situational contexts such as social, communication and cultural contexts, language, human, technical and management related contexts. This necessitate for a comprehensive framework that demonstrates the perspective of situational contexts. This study aims to review the existing situational RE frameworks, highlights the reported situational contexts and provide future research directions. The literature revealed that the situational contexts are commonly related to twelve categories that include stakeholders, organization, requirements, project, management, risk, culture, standard, task, communication, technique and methods, and innovation. The situational contexts related to these categories show the main standpoint of situational software development in GSD. These situational contexts are significant for improving competencies of the team members while performing RE process in GSD environment. This study also draws attention towards some imperative research directions for further studies in line of situational software engineering.",Khan H.; Malik M.; Chofreh A.; Goni F.,Book Series,Lecture Notes on Data Engineering and Communications Technologies,2018-01-01,"National University of Modern Languages;Islamic Azad University, Ahvaz branch",Context ;  Global software development (GSD) ;  Situational requirement engineering (RE)
Navigation payload pathfinder: A modular end to end system engineering test bed,"By 2020 the EU/ESA planned to be able to complete the Galileo FOC constellation and be ready to start operation of a civilian GNSS capability. Since 2007 ESA has initiated the preparatory activities for the evolution of European GNSS systems through the European GNSS Evolution Programme (EGEP). EGEP is an ESA optional programme focusing on R&D for infrastructure technology and system development activities covering the initial definition Phases A and B. In 2015, the European Commission and the European Space Agency signed a Delegation Agreement on the implementation of Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation in Satellite Navigation covering mainly GNSS Evolutions Technology R&D activities and further maturation of the definition activities of the Phase B as a preparation of the Phase C/D/E implementation activities. In the frame of this programme, at the beginning of 2018, ESA has started the Galileo Second Generation (G2G) Space Segment Phase B0/B1 Study for the preliminary design of a Space Segment fulfilling three objectives: independence, robustness, and competitiveness. The resulting satellite solution shall replenish the Galileo satellites at end of life, guarantee the services backward compatibility and be able to provide the required improvements to the FOC services. While Galileo System is providing its initial services (Exploitation Phase), a such complex context, inspired the definition and development of a navigation payload platform, in the following named Navigation Payload Pathfinder for payload engineering activities. To achieve this goal, Thales Alenia Space Italia made significant internal investments to perform a study that started in 2017 and culminated early 2018 with the development of a test bed in the GNSS laboratory located in Rome premises. The paper describes the system architecture design (through a model based system engineering approach), the main subsystems capabilities and the most representative test results. The early version of the Navigation payload Pathfinder was conceived as a modular and incremental system engineering test bed, characterized by the main navigation payload functionalities and an architecture upgradable with the required characteristics of next generation navigation payload. The Pathfinder main mission objectives were: • the development of a Galileo Navigation Payload Emulator allowing the execution of the E2E payload engineering activities such as: design, integration and verification by tests to prove the concept and achievement of the expected results. • Pre-development of a Clock Monitoring and Control Unit Elegant Bread-Board (CMCU EBB) including input clock seamless switchover functionality. • Implementation of a representative Timing Subsystem and its verification by testing • Provision of E2E navigation payload test results with representative hardware in the loop The Navigation payload Pathfinder was based on the reuse of existing assets developed by Thales Alenia Space in the frame of other GNSS initiatives. The last part of this paper provides the most significant test results in terms of: • seamless switch over function between reference atomic clocks sources; • Gain and Phase Variation on a complete RF chain; • Signal quality parameters before and after application of pre-distortion; • End to end data dissemination The Pathfinder will be an important tool to support navigation payload engineering team to verify the achievable performances in an ever greater navigation payload complexity as well as new payload capabilities.",Ciattaglia F.; Putortì G.; Finocchi D.; Pisanu D.; Perugia S.,Conference Proceeding,Ka and Broadband Communications Conference,2018-01-01,Thales Alenia Space Italia,
Biorefinery education as a tool for teaching sustainable development,"Savonia University of Applied Sciences, Finland works closely with economic life and makes studies authentic by using Open Innovation Space learning. In this spirit, ABOWE biorefinery project and the related educational links served as a concrete tool for teaching sustainable development. Savonia invested in a mobile biorefinery pilot plant, which is based on the research of Finnoflag Oy, Finland. In this biorefinery plant solution, biodegradable wastes are valorized to platform chemical and energy products with the aid of microbes and their enzymes. The process is carried out in the same way as the circulation is taking place in the Nature. However, skilled personnel are required for conducting the process runs. Therefore, the engineering, construction and testing of the mobile biorefinery pilot plant served as an excellent opportunity for educating engineers to encounter the basics of biological industrial processes. The interdisciplinary project also provided means for learning from each other in a practical way. ABOWE has been positively evaluated for its multisector approach and for involving students and personnel from many educational organizations in the cooperation.

"Gene editing in livestock: Promise, prospects and policy","Although genetically engineered livestock were first introduced in the 1980s, only three biomedical applications (ATryn ® , Ruconest ® , Kanuma ® ) and one food animal application (AquAdvantage ® salmon) have been brought to market. The initial promise of this technology was hampered by low efficiency, random site integration, public resistance and regulatory hurdles. Gene editing has made it possible to precisely target changes in livestock genomes, overcoming previous challenges. Livestock and poultry editing applications include disease resistance, animal welfare, production traits, animals as bioreactors, xenotransplantation and the development of models for human diseases. The extent to which any of these applications are utilized beyond research laboratories will depend upon regulatory frameworks, uptake by livestock producers and industry, and public acceptance. The 2017 draft US Food and Drug Administration regulatory guidance for gene edited animals, which proposes to regulate ‘intentional’ genomic alterations introduced by editing as new animal drugs irrespective of product novelty or risk, is at odds with emerging regulations around gene edited plants. Lengthy process-based regulation triggered by human ‘intention’ rather than novel product risk may dissuade animal genetics companies and breeders from employing gene editing to introduce beneficial genetic alterations into livestock populations, effectively the same fate encountered by genetic engineering in animals. Goal conflicts will likely continue between genetic innovations to address problems like animal disease and welfare and concerns around the use of modern molecular genetics in food animals. The early applications that successfully navigate regulatory hurdles will influence the public discussion around gene edited animals and impact the trajectory of future applications.",Van Eenennaam A.; Young A.,Journal,"CAB Reviews: Perspectives in Agriculture, Veterinary Science, Nutrition and Natural Resources",2018-01-01,"University of California, Davis",Animal welfare ;  Bioreactors ;  Disease models ;  Disease resistance ;  Gene editing ;  Traits ;  Xenotransplantation

Game-changing space system interface approach with standard potential and space eco-system impact,"The upswing of innovative and commercial NewSpace ventures and general space industry trends suggest a move towards higher lot sizes of systems, subsystems and components, thus, series production. Moreover, on-orbit servicing (OOS) and active debris removal (ADR) have become hot topics in the space arena with potential paradigm shifts in the long-term - all the way to space exploration. At large, these developments and concepts will be enabled by cooperative design and plug-and-play (PnP) principles, which in turn are centred around standardized interfaces per se - as well as modularity. Modular concepts and standardization of space infrastructure elements have been investigated for decades are now gradually becoming a reality as the CubeSat revolution has shown in the first step. Standard interfaces are considered instrumental enablers for new dimensions of flexibility and entirely new space systems, operations and business in particular. The paper addresses these issues from multiple angles based on the patented and multi-functional intelligent Space System Interface â€œiSSIâ€ as self-standing solution and standard option (while developed in the course of the German DLR-funded iBOSS program). Following an introductory snapshot of the technological and functional key features, different applications and utilization potential is highlighted in a suggested market segmentation along associated benefits and applicable businesses. Furthermore, selected economic and business aspects including cost-benefit and economy-of-scale, production engineering and manufacturing drivers and lessons learned, as well as business development routes and models improving the MAIT and service value chain are presented.

Using historical practices to develop safety standards for cooperative on-orbit rendezvous and proximity operations,"Cooperative on-orbit satellite servicing (OOS) and rendezvous and proximity operations (RPO) have the potential to foster the next economic revolution in space. The ability to approach, inspect, grasp, manipulate, modify, repair, refuel, integrate, and build completely new platforms and spacecraft on orbit would enable new business models, innovation, and opportunities in space. However, the lack of clear, widely accepted technical and safety standards for responsible performance of OOS and RPO involving commercial satellites remains a major obstacle to satellite servicing becoming a major industry and could lead to mishaps that would put long-term sustainability of space itself at risk. The Consortium for Execution of Rendezvous and Servicing Operations (CONFERS) is an industry-led initiative with initial seed funding provided by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) that aims to leverage best practices from government and industry to research, develop, and publish non-binding, consensus-derived technical and operations standards for OOS and RPO. As part of the CONFERS effort, the University of Southern California's (USC) Space Engineering Research Center (SERC) conducted initial research into existing RPO methodologies and practices through literature review and interviews with practitioners. This paper provides the results of the first year's analysis in RPO methodologies via a database of flight executed RPO events from past missions (manned and unmanned). Based on the analysis, the paper provides initial recommended metrics to improve safety for cooperative RPO and methods to allow for safety and minimum risk that is scalable to any size satellite/spacecraft. The metrics are meant to encompass new innovations in technologies and techniques related to RPO for any size or caliber of spacecraft, and to show relationships for the larger context of â€œservicingâ€.

"Towards UAE's space science, technology and innovation roadmap","This research ultimately aims to present preliminary work that will be used to develop the first United Arab Emirates' (UAE) science, technology and innovation (STI) roadmap for its space sector. The analysis was based on secondary and primary data collection. The primary data collection was conducted through two empirical studies, a survey and a workshop, to collect data from local academia, satellite operators and aerospace manufacturing firms regarding existing research and development capabilities in space science and technology and future interests. Secondary data includes journals, market reports, technology roadmaps from various sources, and strategies of space agencies. These were then analysed to understand the different STI areas being invested in by the respective country. The results from quantitative and qualitative analyses indicate that the UAE needs to capitalise on opportunities related to the roadmaps that are driving the cutting-edge research at higher-tier agencies. At the same time, the UAE needs to develop local research capabilities in technologies that have national interests. Other developing countries entering into the space sector could also benefit from the proposed methodology.",Hashmi K.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2018-01-01,UAE Space Agency,Foresight ;  R&D ;  Space sector ;  STI ;  Technology Roadmapping
Promoting STEM in primary schools the case of Supernovas Space Education Program in Central America.,"The Central America Association for Aeronautics and Space ACAE promotes research and development projects in space-related technology to orient future generations towards science and technology development. The Supernovas Education Program, is a modular education experience for primary school children developed by ACAE, initially launched in Costa Rica and scheduled for later launch in Honduras. In this program children familiarize themselves with basic space concepts from a multidisciplinary, system focused approach. Space knowledge far from being a goal itself, seeks to be a pretext to learn about the interaction of scientific knowledge and technology, how from this interaction engineering principles emerge, and finally how all these disciplines share the common language of mathematics. Trough each of the programs modules children develop a grasp of Space science and learn engineering concepts. The program is hands-on in which means children learn by doing. At each session after a quick multimedia theoretical briefing, the children proceed to the develop the sessions a â€œspace missionâ€ in which they develop an experiment that illustrates principles related to topics ranging from astronomy and physics to basic robotics and rocketry. Learning trough exploration is at the core of Supernova philosophy, taking advantage of Space as humanity's final frontier to appeal to the explorer in every child, to introduce them through creativity and innovation into the world of science and technology.",Monge L.; Rojas M.; Alvarado C.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2018-01-01,Universidad de Costa Rica;Central American Association of Aeronautics and Space (ACAE),
"Control, sensor and diagnostics systems design for a 1.5 seconds high quality micro gravity drop tower facility","As part of a collaborative project of the Center for Astrophysics and Engineering Research (CASPER) at Baylor University and the Institute for Space Systems (IRS) of the University of Stuttgart, a 1.5 seconds high-quality microgravity non-vacuum drop tower is constructed at the Baylor Research and Innovation Collaborative (BRIC) building in Waco, Texas, USA. An efficient and effective engineering solution for a control, sensor and diagnostics system for the Baylor University drop tower is identified and outlined. The system shall deliver precise monitoring and experiment data with wide supervisory control and data acquisition to ensure adequate operational safety, system security and meaningful experimental results. All of this within the important constraints to develop, build, and maintain the system at low cost so that the financial framework and available funding of the project are not exceeded. Applying the methods of a detailed system engineering approach, broad objectives and detailed top-level requirements and constraints are determined as well as subsystems and components requirements resulting from the engineering design of drop tower and capsule system are identified. An in-depth analysis of the possible operations scenarios leads to detailed design solutions for hardware and software of the overall system. The strategy of a system-oriented â€œtop-downâ€ to â€œbottom-upâ€ development delivers specific subsystems and assemblies with commercial off-the-shelf components needed for realization. A fully developed control room with a control and data acquisition software as well as a diagnostics and monitoring software is the interface to the subsystems of the drop tower. In addition to sensors and cameras for comprehensive monitoring of the tower and the drop capsule as well as its experiment payload, the design consists of fail-safe systems to control access to the tower and the deceleration device inside. As required, the design is implemented using mainly commercial off-the-shelf components with a focus on reliability achieved by redundant hardware and software measures against malfunctions. The subsystems and assemblies are all controlled by low-cost microcomputers as well as microcontroller systems. Moreover, a feasibility study and analysis of necessary modifications to the design for implementing a similar drop tower facility at the University of Cape Town, South Africa was performed. The objective was to keep changes to the existing engineering design of the drop tower as minimal as possible to reduce cost and project schedule. The assessment suggests an unused elevator shaft in one of the new campus buildings as the most promising site for an UCT Drop Tower.",BÃ¼ttner J.; Laufer R.; Herdrich G.; MartinÃ©z P.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2018-01-01,Universität Stuttgart;Baylor University;University of Cape Town,
"Imagine, inspire, innovate: Teacher-researcher space science partnerships catalyze student opportunities in STEM","Imagine, Inspire, Innovate: Imagine the possibilities. What if teachers partner directly with astronomers and space science researchers to engage in authentic, relevant, and real-time space science lessons and research that model industry? How might teacher leaders be inspired and in turn inspire their colleagues and students if teacher leaders are supported and empowered to leverage their knowledge about their students to catapult STEM learning through space science? What level of innovation is possible when the perfect storm happens-partnering teachers with world-class researchers, supporting instructional shifts, and empowering and developing teacher leaders to scale their work? Early work with the NASA Explorer School program subsequent work with the Northwest Earth and Space Science Pipeline clearly demonstrates the high return investment when teachers are directly engaged with research. For students to investigate and learn space science, teachers must gain the skills and knowledge necessary to engage in research and scale their experience. By directly partnering with NASA and space science researchers, teachers connect students with real-time space science. Teachers engage in engineering challenges and space science research-by doing this, teachers are modeling what they expect of students. Our work with teachers has three foundational components: 1. Direct Impact on Teachers: Increase teacher STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) content knowledge and research practices utilizing NASA Mission Science and direct partnerships with researchers. 2. Scale via Teacher Leadership: Empower teachers to transform STEM instruction of others utilizing best practices, state standards, connections to industry, and STEM Teacher Leadership training. 3. Strengthen the STEM pipeline and Eliminate the Opportunity Gap: Support partners to strengthen the STEM pipeline via collective impact utilizing NASA Mission Science. From investigating the how satellite technology and gravity are used to study sea ice change to determining nova distribution in the Andromeda galaxy to learning how astronomers determine the composition of stars, teachers and students engaged in real-time space science investigations that are aligned with current space science, in a manner that is meaningful for their students. Teachers and researchers work through the learning together, launch career-connected learning experiences for students, and set the stage for students to be future ready and thrive in Washington's vibrant environment. Qualitative and quantitative data from an external evaluator indicate increased teaching effectiveness; qualitative and quantitative data from teachers and assessments indicate increased student understanding; and powerful feedback from students indicates increased understanding and application along with increased entry into space science fields.",Borders K.; Thaller M.; Winglee R.; Borders K.; Plecki M.; Ginsberg M.; Harnett E.; Twitchell J.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2018-01-01,National Aeronautics and Space Administration;University of Washington;Washington STEM Center,Achievement gap ;  Career Connected Learning ;  CTE ;  Education ;  NASA ;  STEM
Optical switches of photonics payload,"Optical fibre provides data transfer with low transmission loss, harnesses flexibility and is immune to ElectroMagnetic Interference with other onboard systems. Those characteristics make optical fibre an ideal choice for signal / data transmission inside satellite payloads. The upcoming next generation of space telecom satellite repeaters are required to provide high data throughput while making communications links reconfigurable during all mission phases. This will be made possible by a combination of conventional Radio Frequency equipment with the emerging photonic solutions. Among the various subsystems, the optical switching and routing equipment is responsible for directing incoming optical signals containing Radio Frequency data to suitable output ports. Optical switching, allowing also redundancy functionalities and optical interconnecting, is one of the main enabling photonic technologies. MOEMs optical switching has been the focus of terrestrial research and development during the last decades but, as far as we know, it provides inconclusive results in respect of in-space conditions. Sodern is presently investigating a more appropriate optical switching candidate regarding the space mission environment and spatializing the DirectLight Â® Optical Switching Technology from HUBER+SUHNER Polatis (UK), a major player in fibre optics connectivity equipment for ground applications. The work ahead, as part of the Horizon 2020 European Research and Innovation program, has concentrated on making the core devices more robust technically and therefore we designed a dedicated opto-mechanical structure. This new architecture has recently emerged as feasible. Based on the outcome of these efforts, development of an engineering model focused on electronics robustication will follow and the next challenge will be to flight qualify this model. We report on our progress in developing this optical switching function and provide an overview of the performance.",Le Goff R.; Koechlin C.; Ravel K.; Prevost E.; Parsons N.; Enrico M.; Barker S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2018-01-01,HUBER+SUHNER AG;SODERN,Optical fiber communication ;  Optical switches ;  Photonics
The experiment and science program for the â€œAstronautinâ€ commercial human spaceflight mission,"The primary aim of the initiative ""Astronautin"" is to fly the first female German astronaut to the International Space Station (ISS) in 2020. It intends to demonstrate that a private European company can initiate and carry out a scientifically oriented human space flight mission as a commercial undertaking. It is of utmost importance that the selected Astronautin should serve as a role model engaging with young people, especially young women, and promoting STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) professions. The intention is to carry out scientific experiments, or any other commercialized (sponsored/incentivized) activities, on board the ISS. The Astronautin mission is a privately funded program, which will be financed through strategic partners, sponsors, crowdfunding, crowdsourcing and donations. A major supporter of the project is Airbus Defense and Space with significant in-kind contribution. An experiment and science program supported through a crowdsourcing campaign is currently planned, in cooperation with the innovation company HYVE. This campaign shall also identify additional finance models that could be used for the Astronautin project. For the Astronautin mission a microgravity experiment and science program will be established. Physiological data of female astronauts are currently limited in Germany. Therefore, intended experiments shall aim to encompass all aspects of female physiology. The influence of gravity on the body structures such as bones, muscles, cardiovascular system, brain, etc. shall be investigated using instruments and equipment partly available on the ISS, and partly provided by interested scientists and industry. Furthermore, the effects of radiation on the female body and of self-healing as well as the dynamics of team composition on longer duration exploration missions is of particular interest. This privately organized mission shall provide a platform for industry driven research by simplifying the process of ISS utilization. Subsequent mission ambitions are educational, such as to stimulate the young generation by making mission results available, e.g. by encouraging and facilitating student experiments. This will aid in stimulating the interest of young people for space and space research and inspire young female students for careers in space industry and other technical professions. This paper will present an overview of the progress and status of the Astronautin initiative, with special emphasis on the experimental and scientific program.",Hueser D.; Eichler P.; Kessler C.; Kolloge H.; Thiele-Eich I.; Randall S.; Koehler C.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2018-01-01,Airbus Defence and Space;European Southern Observatory;Stiftung erste deutsche Astronautin gGmbH,Astronaut ;  Female ;  Human spaceflight ;  ISS ;  Microgravity commercial
A cloud-based platform for geo-analytics production from big satellite data: RheticusÂ®,"The ESA's Copernicus Program gave birth to a new era of Big Data for Earth Observation (EO) by Remote Sensing. Furthermore, the ease development and launch of small satellites boosts the availability of satellite imagery. As a consequence of the increasing volume and variety of remote sensing data, EO community faces new challenges in handling datasets. It is not feasible to let operators carrying out the collection, management, processing and analysis of such a huge amount of data through out-dated approaches. Moreover, information have to be provided through smarter and more dynamic ways than ever before. The paper presents a cloud-based platform developed by Planetek Italia, called RheticusÂ® from the name of the unique pupil of Nicolaus Copernicus. RheticusÂ® is able to process high volumes of EO data (e.g. satellite imagery, weather data, open data sources, and so forth) to provide several continuous Earth monitoring services, ranging from the detection and monitoring of geo-hazards and infrastructure instability, to marine water quality monitoring, from supporting aquaculture activities, to wildfire detection as well as land cover monitoring. RheticusÂ®' web interfaces providing business intelligence tools, for the extraction of knowledge derived from continuously processed satellite imagery, simplify the use of this information for non-expert users. Whether it's land monitoring or infrastructure, perimeter of the fires or monitoring the quality of coastal marine waters, RheticusÂ® works as a big hub that processes the data automatically to deliver geoinformation services ready-to-use in users' final applications. Automatic data analysis allows creating geo-analytics and dynamic indicators, and providing actionable knowledge to decision makers. This way engineering and utilities companies, public and private organizations can now easily integrate geospatial free and open information in their business processes, without having to worry about technical data analysis and having the skills to process data. Among the innovations introduced by RheticusÂ®, shifting from a model of monitoring services on request to longtime information service subscriptions is the real disruptive innovation in the field of EO. In this framework Planetek Italia is continuously working in the creation of new approach and new monitoring services through collaborations with academic and research centers. New applications may benefit from multi-source and multi-sensor analysis, as well as from merging data from heterogeneous platforms. At the same time, the new EO data exploitation scenarios, in order to cope with the increasing data availability, require massive data mining processing infrastructures.",Drimaco D.; Abbattista C.; Zotti M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2018-01-01,Planetek Italia,Cloud-based platform ;  Geo-analytics ;  Satellite Big Data
"Analysis of current design methodologies and processes, and potential transfer and applications in concurrent engineering","The department of System Analysis Space Segment of DLR's Institute of Space Systems in Bremen has successfully demonstrated the benefit of Concurrent Engineering (CE) in more than 60 studies since the implementation of the Concurrent Engineering Facility (CEF) in 2008. Hitherto, the core competences that have been developed by DLR in relation to CE have focused on early project phase studies (0/A), analysing mission feasibility and producing high-level system designs. At present, the CE team is working on further developing the CE process to support activities in later phases, and specifically on preliminary design activities (Phase B). Supporting the continued effort to make the work process at the CEF ever more efficient, and as part of the work being carried out to research potential processes to support Phase B activities, other design methodologies have been studied and analysed. The aim of said analysis was drawing parallelisms between successful processes, and deriving lessons learnt and tools from which our CE process could benefit. This paper will investigate various different methodologies and processes used within the industry and across other disciplines, such as Design Thinking for innovation design engineering applied at design institutions such as the Royal College of Art in London. It will also include new paradigms and hypothesis, among which are trends and innovative methodologies, such as Lean Design, or Six Sigma, and an examination of the tools and work elements that can potentially be incorporated to the Concurrent Engineering process as currently defined, or in later phases.",Martelo A.; Wojdecka A.; Jahnke S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2018-01-01,Royal College of Art;Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR),Concurrent engineering ;  Design methods ;  Design thinking
"Current strategies and future perspectives of skin-on-a-chip platforms: Innovations, technical challenges and commercial outlook","The skin is the largest and most exposed organ in the human body. Not only it is involved in numerous biological processes essential for life but also it represents a significant endpoint for the application of pharmaceuticals. The area of in vitro skin tissue engineering has been progressing extensively in recent years. Advanced in vitro human skin models strongly impact the discovery of new drugs thanks to the enhanced screening efficiency and reliability. Nowadays, animal models are largely employed at the preclinical stage of new pharmaceutical compounds development for both risk assessment evaluation and pharmacokinetic studies. On the other hand, animal models often insufficiently foresee the human reaction due to the variations in skin immunity and physiology. Skin-on-chips devices offer innovative and state-of-the-art platforms essential to overcome these limitations. In the present review, we focus on the contribution of skin-on-chip platforms in fundamental research and applied medical research. In addition, we also highlighted the technical and practical difficulties that must be overcome to enhance skin-on-chip platforms, e.g. embedding electrical measurements, for improved modeling of human diseases as well as of new drug discovery and development.",Öztürk A.; Miccoli B.; Adali M.; Mogtader F.; Sharifi F.; Çeçen B.; Yaşayan G.; Braeken D.; Alarcin E.,Journal,Current Pharmaceutical Design,2018-01-01,İstinye Üniversitesi;Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre;Marmara Üniversitesi;Sharif University of Technology;KU Leuven;Universitätsklinikum und Medizinische Fakultät Tübingen;Dokuz Eylül Üniversitesi;NanoBMT,Drug discovery and development ;  In vitro skin model ;  Microfluidic ;  Skin impedance ;  Skin tissue engineering ;  Skin-on-chip
Responsible innovation in molecular robotics in Japan,"Over the last decade Japanese researchers have taken the lead in the emerging discipline of molecular robotics. This new technology aims to produce artificial molecular systems that can adapt to changes in the environment, self-organize and evolve. This paper explores the question of how to stimulate responsible research and innovation in the field of molecular robotics technologies. For this, we first draw lessons from earlier societal responses in Japan to emerging technologies, such as genetic engineering, nanotechnology, synthetic biology and genomic research. Next we describe various real-time technology assessment (TA) activities on molecular robotics in Japan to depict the state-of-the-art of the academic and public debate on the social aspects of molecular robotics. Lessons from earlier societal responses to emerging technologies demonstrated three potential challenges: finding and involving the ‘right’ experts and stakeholders, keeping regulations up to date, and getting scientists and citizens involved in science communication. A literature review, ‘future workshop’ and scenario workshop raised a number of ethical, social, political and cultural issues, and addressed desirable and undesirable scenarios for the next few decades. Twitter text mining analysis indicates that the level of attention, knowledge and awareness about molecular robots among a broader audience is still very limited. In conclusion, we identify four activities crucial to enable responsible innovation in molecular robotics—getting to grips with the speed of the development of molecular robotics, monitoring related technical trends, the establishment of a more stable TA knowledge base, and a sustained interaction between molecular roboticists and social scientists.",Yoshizawa G.; van Est R.; Yoshinaga D.; Tanaka M.; Shineha R.; Konagaya A.,Journal,Chem-Bio Informatics Journal,2018-01-01,Institute of Science Tokyo;Technische Universiteit Eindhoven;Arbeidsforskningsinstituttet;Waseda University;Rathenau Institute - KNAW;Seijo University,ELSI ;  Molecular robotics ;  Real-time technology assessment ;  Research and innovation governance ;  Responsible research and innovation
Competencies and performance of engineering professors: Evidence from a brazilian public university,"This research aims to analyze the influence of Engineering professors’ competencies on their performance, as perceived by Engineering students and graduates from a Brazilian federal public university. Regarding methodology, a set of Engineering educators’ competencies were proposed, identified, and validated by exploratory factor analysis (EFA), parallel analysis, internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha), and partial confirmatory factor analysis (PCFA) in a sample of 139 Engineering students and graduates (engineers), who answered a 35-item questionnaire. Results reveal three main competencies (namely, content-pedagogical knowledge, innovation-inspiring attitudes, and emotional skills) that further the research on the competencies of Engineering professors. First, content-pedagogical knowledge is perceived by students as a single, merged competence. Second, Engineering students not only need to develop innovation competencies, but Engineering educators also have to develop innovation-inspiring attitudes to motivate students’ innovativeness. Third, emotional skills also play an important role in professors’ performance. Finally, the impact of these competencies on Engineering educators’ performance was confirmed and analyzed by means of a logistic regression.",Carvalho G.; Corrêa R.; Carvalho H.; Vieira A.; Stankowitz R.; Kolotelo J.,Journal,Ingenieria e Investigacion,2018-01-01,Rennes School of Business;Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná;Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Paraná;Universidade Estadual de Ponta Grossa;Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina;Universidade Federal do Parana;Tuiuti University;Taubate University;Sergipe Federal University,Brazil ;  Education ;  Engineering educator ;  Evaluation ;  Higher education

What is new technology and what technology is new? Definitions of emerging technology in policy documents and global corporate communication,"This article addresses the two-fold problem faced by the researchers of emerging technologies. First, the problem of definition: which term is appropriate to define new technologies; and second, what principles and methods are appropriate to classify a certain technology as new or emerging. Locally, this problem is also relevant, because the definitions of new technologies and the actual technologies are rarely discussed by Lithuanian researchers. To fill this gap, exploratory research has been conducted to compare definitions and the technological content of new technologies in international policy documents and the corporate websites of global corporations leading in research and development investments. Focusing on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the European Commission (EC), a policy document analysis showed that the term high technology, which dominated the discourse in the 1980s and well into the 1990s, has since been eclipsed by innovations and sustainable development, moving from an economy-centered approach to a focus on the qualitative aspects of technology development and its social impact. Within policy documents, various quantitative variables are applied to measure technology development at the level of regions, states or specific technological fields, such as the intensity of investments in research and development or the fields in which explosive growths of worldwide patents occur. However, a variety of methodological implications limit the use of this data to map the emergence and the potential impact of more specific technologies, rather than wide fields of development. The website content of globally operating corporations known for being the leaders of business investment in R & D shows that the corporate discourse focuses on a rhetoric of progress and global impact as the main driving force of technological development. Commercially prospective technologies, as presented on corporate websites, emerged in the following seven technological fields in 2017: pharmaceutics and biotechnology, software engineering, web technologies, social research, electronic engineering, telecommunications, and transportation. This method offers the advantage of analyzing both specific technologies and the broader technological fields they belong to. Also, in contrast to policy documents, the list of new technologies in the corporate context offers several significant insights into the interdisciplinary nature of technological development and the contribution of the major technological fields to overall technological development. Overall, the list highlights the ties between micro- (individual level) and macro-level (society and state) technological impact, the interplay of visible (end-user products) and invisible (infrastructure) elements of technological systems. The results reflect the specifics of commercial settings, where new technologies are at a stage of development following fundamental scientific research and preceding mass production and distribution of innovations. The differences between technology discourse in policy documents and corporate communication are reflective of a wider split into expert and public discourse, characteristic of the different aims pursued by the respective agents. Findings about the definitions and classifications of new technologies presented in this article may be applied for policy-making in the areas of science, technology and innovation management, research of the social impact of technologies, and critical discussions of the ethical, legal, social and economic implications of technology development before their mass adoption.",Šupa M.,Journal,Informacijos Mokslai,2018-01-01,Vilniaus Universitetas,Aukštosios technologijos ;  Emerging technologies ;  High technology ;  Moksliniai ;  Naujosios technologijos ;  Research and development ;  Social studies of technology ;  Socialiniai technologiju tyrimai ;  Technology discourses

A cochrane method systematic review of university tech commercialization research,"Since 1980 universities have been able to commercialize inventions that their faculty researchers create as per the 1980 Bayh-Dole Act (P.L. 96-517). Research universities can now own and license these inventions to small and well established companies. Since 1980, research universities have used tech commercialization to support their regional economies with product development and sales, and academic entrepreneurship resulting in university spinoffs and start-up business formations. This results in job creation. The technology transfer offices (TTOs) which were established at many research universities to manage this process have been studied quite extensively. However, the foundational elements that fuel successful TTO performance has not been studied comprehensively. Instead, there are numerous fragmented studies that date back to the early 1980s. In addition, there is no agreed upon common theory for studying university technology and how these elemental inputs related to performance outputs. Thus, herein it is advocated that the resource-based view (J. Barney, 1991) and theory on environmental munificence (Castrogiovanni, 1991, 2002) be used as a theoretical framework for researching university technology commercialization. Competitive resources in a more munificent environment can make it easier for an organization to survive and prosper.",Hamilton C.,Conference Proceeding,"39th International Annual Conference of the American Society for Engineering Management, ASEM 2018: Bridging the Gap Between Engineering and Business",2018-01-01,Winthrop University,Engineers ;  Innovation management ;  Management of innovation ;  Management of new technologies ;  Management of scientists ;  Meta-analysis ;  Project ;  R&D management ;  Systematic review ;  Technology commercialization ;  Technology management ;  Technology transfer

Technological surveillance competences for entrepreneurs: A key factor to boost the number of science-based startups,"This article explores how the development of technological surveillance competences in entrepreneurs can foster the increase in number of startups based on hard sciences and disruptive technologies rather than internet-based applications in Argentina. This analysis was done from an empirical perspective, using secondary sources of information and interviews with experts of the Ministry of Science and Technology of Argentina, academic directors of entrepreneurial programs and entrepreneurs. The article is structured as follows: initially, a startup's database analysis was performed based on the report of Tecnolatinas Research and venture capital databases. As a result, emerged the low percentage of science- based startups in Argentina and Latin America compared with the internet-based ones. A list of the most relevant science-based startups from Argentina was developed. Several factors emerged as possible contributors to the situation: i) level of interaction between Academia and entrepreneurs; ii) level of Technological Surveillance training of entrepreneurs; iii) level of Technology transference from Academia to entrepreneurial ecosystems and; iv) level of interdisciplinarity inside Academia. Among all of the surveyed factors, the level of Technology Surveillance training of entrepreneurs was considered very relevant for being considered strategic. A research of the main programs and courses about entrepreneurship in Argentina was conducted, showing the absence of the technological surveillance subject in almost all of them. Finally, a set of findings are discussed and presented together with potential areas for further considerations and implementation.",Castiglioni S.; Adam C.,Conference Proceeding,"62nd Annual Meeting of the International Society for the Systems Sciences, ISSS 2018: Innovation and Optimization in Nature and Design",2018-01-01,,Innovation ;  Interdisciplinary education ;  Science-based startups ;  Start up's management ;  Technological surveillance competences

A hybrid framework of computer-aided instruction and problem-based learning for metamorphic design pedagogy,"Emerging issues such as responsive, interactive, kinetic, dynamic and growing architecture are relatively new areas of focus in architectural design education. They collectively represent an interdisciplinary domain that helps produce metamorphic buildings where architectural configuration, internal anatomy and external morphology mutate throughout the building’s lifecycle. The skills needed to generate metamorphic designs must be enhanced by high imagination, creativity, technical knowledge, and by tools to communicate morphing compositions and their animated transformations. This domain does not only pose new challenging problems but also necessitates using technology applications to enhance the tedious manual production of various composition mutations. Within this context, a project is orchestrated to incorporate the concepts and skills of “Metamorphic Architecture” into the curriculum of the College of Architecture in Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST). The project focuses on the metamorphosis of external compositions as well as the varying interactions between the inhabitants and their internal environments based on the principles of anthropometrics and ergonomics. In addition, the project implementation maximizes the application of computer-aided learning tools to visualize, model, communicate and simulate emergent concepts in engineering design. The research design is mainly based on action research where a design framework is developed and implemented in real-life studio settings. The approach used in the framework development is based on the constructivist theory and problem-based learning principles to enhance the participants’ knowledge development while they apply the project. Findings and reflections of the project development and implementation are discussed. They seem to encourage the incorporation of the principles of metamorphic design and computer-aided learning applications into the architectural pedagogy plans as a solution for some critical situations, and as an intellectual exercise of innovation and cross-disciplinary networking.",Eilouti B.,Journal,International Journal of Design Education,2018-01-01,Prince Sultan University,Computer-aided Instruction ;  Computer-aided Learning ;  Digital Studio ;  Kinetic Architecture ;  Metamorphic Design ;  Problem-based Learning
University workshops as a way of dissemination of architectural traditions: The case of the tile vault,"University workshops about traditional construction systems have proven an interesting tool for the contemporary dissemination of architectural traditions. These workshops commonly seek to revitalize abandoned construction systems; however, they may also be helpful in testing research on traditional techniques, and on the virtues these techniques might offer in the light of current innovations. This paper summarizes the experience of various workshops held between 2005 and 2017 on the construction of tile vaults, a traditional construction system typical of the Mediterranean region.

Iran: The positive experience of S&T development,"The article analyzes S&T development of Iran. One of the main characteristics of the Iranian S&T sector during the last two decades has been a rapid growth of scientific publications in number, and an improvement of the published works' quality despite international sanctions and economic situation in the country. To explain this growth, the authors first examine Iranian science policies (the so-called “S&T jihad”) and compare them with the Russian case. Unlike in Russia, the Iranian S&T sector relies heavily on universities, not on academic research organizations. In recent years, the Iranian S&T policy has been focusing on connecting technology development and economic welfare, building innovation infrastructure and supporting application of scientific discoveries in product and process innovations. Focus on engineering sciences has helped to develop the Iranian S&T sector. Given the restrictions on the technology and equipment import, the country managed to form not only a supply of technologies (mainly generated by universities), but also a steady demand for them from the real sector. International sanctions have had a rather contradictory impact on Iran's international scientific and technical cooperation. As statistics show, cooperation measured by the number of joint publications of Iranian and foreign researchers is strengthening year by year. At the same time, at the level of technological exchange, the destructive impact of the sanctions constraints is heavy, but the trends of recent years indicate the prospects of easing these prohibitions. The analysis shows that the scientific and technological breakthrough is quite feasible even with very modest starting positions and constantly increasing sanctions pressure. Russia and Iran are very similar in a number of economic aspects, therefore, the Iranian experience is extremely useful for adjusting the S&T policy in Russia.",Malakhov V.; Yurevich M.; Aushkap D.,Journal,World Economy and International Relations,2018-01-01,"Russian Research Institute of Economics, Politics and Law in Science and Technology (RIEPL);Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation",Higher education ;  International S&T cooperation ;  Iran ;  S&T development ;  S&T management ;  “S&T jihad”
Modelling subsea ROV motion using the moving frame method,"Norway conducts operations on a variety of structures in the North Sea; e.g. oilrigs, monopole windmills, subsea trees. These structures often require subsea installation, observation, and maintenance. Research and technology that can improve the efficiency of these operations are of high interest to the nation. A remotely operated vehicle (ROV) can assist in these operations. However, the ROV pilot must observe and adjust the vehicle and its motion in accordance with its task, but modified due to impending forces. Automation of this motion is the desired goal. This paper researches the motion of an ROV induced by the motion of the robotic manipulators, motor torques, and fluid buoyancy. The research introduces a new method in engineering dynamics: the Moving Frame Method (MFM). Lie Group Theory and Cartan’s notion of moving frames are the foundation of the MFM. This research extends previous work in significant ways. This research accounts for the motor torques, fluid viscosity and the mass of the manipulator's arms. Interactive visualization on hand-held devices is also an integral part of this research. The Web Graphics Library (WebGL) is a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. This work visualizes the results, interactively, on 3D web pages, viewable on cell phones using WebGL. This work invites further research into improved numerical methods, solid/fluid interaction and the design of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV). AUVs beckon an era of Artificial Intelligence when machines think, communicate and learn. Rapidly deployable software implementations will be essential to this task. This paper demonstrates the MFM clears the path toward such technological innovations.",Austefjord K.; Hestvik M.; Larsen L.; Impelluso T.,Conference Proceeding,"ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, Proceedings (IMECE)",2018-01-01,Western Norway University of Applied Sciences,
Creating accounts of diverse developmental writing paths within a colombian major in industrial engineering,"This paper describes developmental writing paths within a Colombian major in Industrial Engineering. The accounts were created through retrospective descriptions of students’ writing experiences collected by a qualitative survey and analyzing writing samples. The study shows that writing throughout the major embraces diverse functions (Writing to learn; Writing to apply content knowledge; Writing to research; Writing to communicate ideas), and traces diverse developmental paths (Writing for innovation; Lab writing; Writing for company analysis; Writing for conducting a senior thesis). This analysis also reveals that different types of problems (improving profits in companies or creating new devices) can be treated through different types of genres (research proposals in companies and projects of innovation), despite the fact that the same label (report) is being used by participants to group writing experiences. One of the writing functions in the major that seems overtly identified by the students is conducting a senior thesis. Since there are other writing functions present across the curriculum, further studies and pedagogical debates with faculty members are necessary to define what writing developmental paths are expected from the students and how many curriculum projects (that include explicit teaching on theories of disciplinary writing and genre knowledge) across the curriculum should be undertaken.",Narvaez E.,Journal,Writing and Pedagogy,2018-01-01,Universidad Autónoma de Occidente,Disciplinary and professional writing ;  Engineering writing ;  Global writing studies
Study of morphological changes and sustainable development on the southern coasts of the Caspian Sea using remote sensing and GIS,"Coastal areas are continuously subject to global changing and the interaction of land and sea resulting in the short- and long-term transformation. Study of beach morphology has been one of the most important issues in coastal engineering research projects. Managing and controlling the shoreline changes and behavior are essential for marine projects and integrated coastal zone management policy in such environment. In the present study, based on the available data of Guilan province region, an analysis of the coastal zone behavior is made. Based on extensive research, the bed level changes and submerged area due to a rise in sea level at different locations inside the study area are estimated and compared with those obtained from the satellite images based on remote sensing indicating a good consistency. The results of survey are presented graphically and changes in shorelines are estimated using sensors' ETM+ and OLI images from 2002 to 2013, which can be used for site selection and design of marine structures and establishing a data base for the sustainable development of the coastal zone in the study region. Laplacian filter is applied to satellite images to establish the shoreline and to clarify the effect of ports and coastal structures constructed in the study region on beach and shoreline morphological changes. This study is a combination of remote sensing and GIS methods with field observations on the ground. The innovation of this work is using Laplacian filters for shoreline detection and estimation of the sediment deposition area by calculating the distance between the observed shorelines. This will lead us to the better understanding of the effect of coastal structures on the beach morphology using satellite images. The results show the remarkable changes occurred in the shoreline due to the environmental and human-based effects during the study period.",Neshaei S.; Safaval P.; Zarkesh M.; Karimi P.,Journal,WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment,2018-01-01,Islamic Azad University;University of Guilan,Caspian Sea ;  Change detection ;  Coastline ;  GIS ;  Remote sensing ;  Sediment area
Advancing regulatory science with computational modeling for medical devices at the FDA's office of science and engineering laboratories,"Protecting and promoting public health is the mission of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), which regulates medical devices marketed in the U.S., envisions itself as the world's leader in medical device innovation and regulatory science-the development of new methods, standards, and approaches to assess the safety, efficacy, quality, and performance of medical devices. Traditionally, bench testing, animal studies, and clinical trials have been the main sources of evidence for getting medical devices on the market in the U.S. In recent years, however, computational modeling has become an increasingly powerful tool for evaluating medical devices, complementing bench, animal and clinical methods. Moreover, computational modeling methods are increasingly being used within software platforms, serving as clinical decision support tools, and are being embedded in medical devices. Because of its reach and huge potential, computational modeling has been identified as a priority by CDRH, and indeed by FDA's leadership. Therefore, the Office of Science and Engineering Laboratories (OSEL)-the research arm of CDRH-has committed significant resources to transforming computational modeling from a valuable scientific tool to a valuable regulatory tool, and developing mechanisms to rely more on digital evidence in place of other evidence. This article introduces the role of computational modeling for medical devices, describes OSEL's ongoing research, and overviews how evidence from computational modeling (i.e., digital evidence) has been used in regulatory submissions by industry to CDRH in recent years. It concludes by discussing the potential future role for computational modeling and digital evidence in medical devices.",Morrison T.; Pathmanathan P.; Adwan M.; Margerrison E.,Journal,Frontiers in Medicine,2018-01-01,"Food and Drug Administration, Center for Devices and Radiological Health",Computational modeling ;  FDA ;  Medical devices ;  Regulatory science ;  Virtual clinical trials ;  Virtual patients

Research on the improvement of ERP implementation in purchasing departments from the perspective of internal control,"With the wide applications and development of information technology and network technology, focusing on the background of ERP (enterprise resource planning) systems and people's reliance on both information system and accounting information systems, as important parts of ERP, plays a vital role in the management of enterprises. However, due to the continuous introduction of new innovations in the ERP system, enterprises continue to improve their competitiveness and management levels. When advanced ERP management can be practically implemented in the system, it will inevitably present difficult internal control measures, network environmental risks and many other problems. Then how to build the internal control system to ensure that enterprises in the pursuit of ERP information systems, simultaneously better serve the enterprise's own internal controls and management, and minimize the internal control and design defects. In addition to the system controls, in order to better conduct internal controls, one must deeply investigate the business processes, using necessary informational means, and constantly change their own architecture and business process reengineering (BPR), in order to technically improve the internal governance structure. Thus, the corresponding internal controls will include the system-oriented controls and the various business, personnel, and departments' overall grasp of the change. This encourages enterprises to seek reasonable ways, methods and ideas for continuous innovation. We should actively address and adjust the challenges brought by the internal control system of the accounting information system under the ERP environment, and make full use of ERP technology and BPR to realize the internal control norms of enterprises.",Zhao Y.; Li W.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International Conference on Electronic Business (ICEB),2018-01-01,Guilin University of Electronic Technology,Business process reengineering ;  ERP implementation ;  Improvement ;  Internal control

From engineer to entrepreneur – Entrepreneurship education for engineering students: The case of the entrepreneurial Campus Villach,"Entrepreneurship education is quite a novel phenomenon that is gaining in-creasing importance in academia and practice alike. Entrepreneurship education aims to provide the necessary skills and knowledge that enable students to successfully found a new venture. Hitherto entrepreneurship education has not received much attention in engineering pedagogy. This finding is quite surprising because through proper entrepreneurship education engineers can be enabled to exploit entrepreneurial opportunities that result from technological innovation. Thus, we argue that entrepreneurship education should be a cornerstone in engineering education. The paper introduces the ‘Entrepreneurial Campus Villach’ located at the Carinthia University of Applied Sciences (CUAS). The campus is among the first in Austria that provide an extensive and scientifically sound entrepreneurship program.

Design and testing of a boom sprayer prototype to release trichogramma ostriniae (hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) in sweet corn for biocontrol of ostrinia nubilalis (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae),"Sweet corn requires many insecticide applications to control its main pest: the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae). The use of Trichogramma is an effective biological alternative to control the European corn borer in sweet corn. However, manual introduction at large scale of Trichogramma using Trichocards is time-consuming. Mechanized introduction of Trichogramma using a boom sprayer is an innovative and advantageous solution. The objective of this study was to design and test a boom sprayer to spray Trichogramma ostriniae (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) in sweet corn canopy under real field conditions. Trichogramma ostriniae parasitized eggs were sprayed at a rate of 800,000 individuals ha -1 using a boom sprayer designed at the Department of Soils and Agri-Food Engineering of Université Laval, Québec, Canada. Trichogramma parasitized eggs were also introduced at a rate of 500,000 individuals ha -1 using Trichocards. Overall, eight releases were made during the 2016 season. Field trial results showed a 17.22% emergence rate reduction of Trichogramma in the sprayed plots compared to Trichocards. Total fecundity and longevity of sprayed T. ostriniae females were not negatively affected by spraying; indicating that spraying did not have any negative impact on their quality. The parasitism rates observed on natural egg masses of O. nubilalis and on sentinel egg masses of Ephestia kuehniella were comparable for both methods. At harvest, sprayed and Trichocards treatments resulted in adequate control of the European corn borer. Obtained results also showed that spraying was 1.7 times faster than the manual introduction of Trichocards. Overall, the results indicate that spraying is a promising technique for an efficient and viable introduction of Trichogramma parasitized eggs. However, more research is recommended to further optimize the spraying parameters. The spraying system successfully used in sweet corn could also be used in corn production and adapted to other crops such as pepper, beans, and potatoes to control the European corn borer.",Dionne A.; Khelifi M.; Todorova S.; Boivin G.,Journal,Transactions of the ASABE,2018-01-01,Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu Research and Development Centre;Université Laval;Anatis Bioprotection Inc.,Beneficial insects ;  Biological control ;  Boom sprayer ;  Corn production ;  European corn borer ;  Ostrinia nubilalis ;  Spraying ;  Sweet corn ;  Trichocards ;  Trichogramma ;  Trichogramma ostriniae

In 2017, almost 30 PKW units were achieved or under construction in the world. PKW units were built worldwide on the 5 continents (http://www.pk-weirs. ulg.ac.be/?q=content/world-register-pkw). Among them, more than 12 units were built in France. PKW are based on the traditional labyrinth spillway concept consisting in increasing the overflowing length by “folding” the crest of the spillway into many “zig zag”. PKW are an answer to the main drawback of traditional labyrinth spillway: They can be installed at the top of the narrow crest of most existing concrete gravity or arch dams with a small footprint on foundation. The original idea and principle were developed by Lemperiere and Ouamane [1] after years of development based on numerous physical models performed mainly at Biskra university (Algeria) and EDF hydraulic laboratory (France). They also have three essential qualities: - They have large specific discharge capacities which allow to significantly increase existing dam overall discharge capacity. - They are free flow spillway. Thus they have an excellent reliability because they operate without any electro-mechanical component nor human operator which might fail. They also do not require any energy source or remote control. In addition, they require little maintenance. - PKW have very simple geometrical features, basically triangles and rectangles. Thus they are easy to design and build. As a summary PKW are a cost effective solution for both existing and rehabilitation project. This innovation is a cost effective answer to dam safety issues becoming more and more important. Specific discharge capacity are suitable from 5 to 100 m 3 /s/ml depending on available hydraulic head and PKW dimensions. It can exceed 30 m 3 /s/ml for 3 m head. PKW concept is suitable either for existing dam rehabilitation or for new dams. In the latter case, a combination “gates + PKW” has revealed many advantages by optimizing cost, reliability and other technical issues such as reservoir level control or sediment passage. In parallel to this quick engineering development, many research actions have been carried out in cooperation with various universities and institutions in various countries (France, Switzerland, Belgium, Algeria, India, Vietnam, USA etc..). Innovation features were developed and includes hydraulic, structural and economical construction features (cost, delay, project management). The innovative PKW fractal concept is very promising for low head spillways and miscellaneous hydraulic application such as the control of reservoir and channels levels.",Laugier F.; Vermeulen J.,Conference Proceeding,"26th International Congress on Large Dams, 2018",2018-01-01,Electricité de France,Aeration ;  Flood ;  Flood control ;  Numerical model ;  Physical model ;  PKW ;  Spillway ;  Surface spillway ;  Uncontrolled spillway ;  Waterstop
"Port of Santos, Brazil: Essential factors to implement a green port system","Having a port integrated with its surroundings, interacting harmoniously with the city in the surroundings, generating wealth and not denigrating the environment is a considerable challenge. Some ports in Europe and the United States can serve as a model for other ports in the world. These ports use renewable energy in their transport, storage and handling operations. They use renewable energies to load and unload ships, minimize or eliminate the use of fossil fuels in their day-to-day operations, and manage every chain that involves the movement of vessels at their terminals, as well as other modals integrated into the ports. This research analyze the current logistics operations of the port of Santos, the most significant port in Latin America, as well as its physical characteristics and legal aspects and public policies that govern Brazilian port activities. It aims to address what possible operations, technologies, and innovations are suitable in the medium and long-term to make it a port capable and integrated to other international ports with sustainable logistics operations.",Moura D.; Botter R.,Conference Proceeding,"Progress in Maritime Technology and Engineering - Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Maritime Technology and Engineering, MARTECH 2018",2018-01-01,Universidade de São Paulo;Universidade Federal do ABC,

Against traffic engineering axioms. A change in the hierarchy of the priorities of the city transport planning: Slow mobility and public transport to change user behavior for safety purposes,"The aim of this presentation is to overcome the idea that traffic flow management and regulation can pursue urban quality, sustainability and security. An organic framework of strategies and operational tools is needed, which means adopting medium-term Integrated Transport Plans (10+ years) including Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans. Sustainability goals require urban mobility focused on high quality public transport integrated with bicycle routes and pedestrian paths. Motorized private mobility should provide local accessibility (in low density areas) and short-haul routes. Such a redesigned transport system would have considerable savings particularly for families, given the cost of auto ownership. Innovations in passenger cars (fuels, driverless, etc.) do not change the rules of mobility; they are “product innovation”, not a positive evolution of the system. Technological innovation in collective transport today make it possible to redesign cities for people not cars. This is the true challenge of this century for the whole world!.",Cappelli A.,Conference Proceeding,"Town and Infrastructure Planning for Safety and Urban Quality - Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Living and Walking in Cities, LWC 2017",2018-01-01,Università IUAV di Venezia,
Contrasting innovation competence FINCODA model in software engineering: Narrative review,"Purpose: Innovation competences are expected both in businesses and in higher education. Software organizations, in particular, require engineers that collaborate to deliver better services and products. Staff recruitment and training are human resource management tasks that are crucial to insuring that applicants and job holders have the competences that will facilitate quality output in software development processes. This paper narrates the results of the mapping review accomplished to determine the competences that describe high-performing, innovative professionals in software engineering and weighs them against the FINCODA model on innovation competences devised to assess and enhance individuals’ capacity to innovate; a core outcome of the Framework for Innovation Competences Development and Assessment Project. Design/methodology/approach: A review protocol was followed to examine the literature on software engineering to identify the innovation competence and behavioral indicators that are required in individuals. Findings: According to the literature, the innovation competences required of the staff in software companies are creativity, critical thinking, initiative, team work and networking, dimensions that are contained in the FINCODA model. Findings also support the inclusion of the thirty-four behavioral indicators that constitute the five dimensions of the FINCODA model. Originality/value: Business organizations need tools to assess innovation competences in employees. Universities, as well, lack the instruments to measure development of innovation competence in undergraduates that teaching/learning methods should enhance before students reach the workplace. This research sheds light on innovative workplace behaviors of software engineers and on feasible designs of training programs for staff and undergraduates by using the FINCODA model and its behavioral indicators. Future research will focus on ratifying the validation of the model and the online assessment tool derived from it.",Andreu-Andrés M.; González-Ladrón-de-Guevara F.; García-Carbonell A.; Watts-Hooge F.,Journal,Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management,2018-01-01,Universitat Politècnica de València,Behavioral indicators ;  Competence ;  FINCODA model ;  Innovation ;  Mapping review ;  Narrative review ;  Software engineering
Case-based Instruction in Undergraduate Engineering: Does student confidence predict learning?,"Research on the implementation of case studies in engineering has suggested that students find that cases allow them to see the relevance of engineering concepts to real world issues. Research has also found that students do not perceive cases to be beneficial to their learning while actual learning outcomes suggest otherwise. The goal of this study was to examine the relationship between students’ perceptions of their learning confidence and engagement with their actual learning performance for case-based instruction and traditional lecture-based approaches. Thirty-five students enrolled in an undergraduate engineering course participated in the study. The study utilized a within subjects A-B-A-B experimental design with traditional lecture as the baseline condition and case-based instruction as the experimental condition. Participants completed a quiz to assess their learning and a survey to measure their perceptions of learning and engagement. Results suggested that students’ perceptions about their own learning did not predict their actual learning outcomes while their perceptions of engagement predicted their conceptual understanding. We also found that cases can lead to significantly greater conceptual learning gains as compared to traditional lecture approach; however, case-based instruction does not influence measures of rote learning. Given that prior research on case studies in engineering has primarily focused on using student perceptions as proxies for actual learning outcomes, these results suggest that engineering educators need to be cautious when interpreting student outcomes based on their perceptions. Our results suggest that engineering education researchers should be careful when using student perceptions to assess the impact of curricular innovations.",Yadav A.; Alexander V.; Mehta S.,Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2018-01-01,Michigan State University;Purdue University,Case-based instruction ;  Student learning ;  Student perceptions

Management of innovation in tourism oranizations,"Innovations can be applied in any human activity; however, it is the business sector which is considered a priority sphere, especially the manufacturing industry and the market-aimed services. The author of this article carried out research among managers in tourist traffic sector to find out their opinions on innovations in organizations they had managed in 2017. The research dealt with evaluation of what categories of innovations were implemented, what impulses initiated their implementation, what were the competences for their implementation and what re-engineering levels were implemented according to the restructuring activities. Verification or negation of the specified hypotheses was enabled by application of the statistical methods of dependence research to the fundamental variables. The research results point out that in the monitored period the product innovations were implemented in most cases, whereas implementation of the saving management innovations was quite seldom. The most often reason for all changes was a vision of the organization. Almost 90% of the organizations pay attention to determination of competencies for preparation and implementation of the changes.

Bionic science as a tool for innovation in Mega-Cities,"The conquest of vertical space in the context of architecture and construction appears to be one of the smartest solutions in the quest to balance the current overpopulation and energy consumption rationale of our mega-cities. However, actual structural models of vertical construction are exceedingly restricted. Upon reaching the 500/650-m high frontier, considerably large amounts of construction material are necessary to complete just below 30% of the built up area. Bionic Architecture contains a myriad of innovative tools that enable the development of groundbreaking designs for vertical engineering. Nature provides us with countless examples from which we draw ideas. When we observe a tree and how its structure works, we see a complex system of veins and fibres, which have an amazing capacity to resist strong winds and also to conduct fluids. This self-regulated natural system is an ideal model to “imitate” when designing high-rise skyscrapers, which, similarly, fight against the wind and hold shifting masses of people. The application of bionics ranges from improving the aerodynamics of aircraft and creating water-resistant surfaces, to designing and building pioneering high rise ecological skyscrapers and revolutionary Vertical Cities that are capable of sourcing the energy and accommodating up to 100,000 people. The Be-Bionic City Tower is a pioneering architectural design of a Vertical City, and the first high-rise structure to reach 1228 m. high. It is also the first fully self-sustainable vertical construction, which means that it can fully satisfy its energy needs drawing from natural resources such as sunlight, wind and rainwater. Experimenting with Biological Structures and their application to new construction models in the Be-Bionic City Tower is the starting point to create a new area of practice-based research in architecture, that of Bionic Architecture.",Cervera R.; Pioz J.,Book Series,Urban Book Series,2018-01-01,Universidad Politécnica de Madrid;Universidad de Alcalá;Principal of Cervera & Pioz Architects,Bionic architecture ;  Self-sufficient urbanism ;  Vertical city

Do software startups innovate in the same way? A case survey study,"The research interest in software startups has expanded a lot in the last years as shown by the increase in the published papers, and the organization of research workshops. However, two recent systematic mapping studies recognize an inconsistency in the characterization of software startups in the literature, even though they acknowledge that innovativeness and uncertainty are the common themes the literature uses to describe these companies. In the new product development literature, even though not consolidated, innovativeness is usually related to technology and/or market discontinuities. These two different types of novelty could bring distinct consequences to software development activities in software startups. Using a case survey research approach, we analyzed 27 published papers from the period 2013-17. We identified and categorized the innovation in 18 software startups products or services from the perspective of discontinuities. We found that software engineering literature did not differentiate software startups based on the innovations they develop. Nevertheless, most studied software startups work on products with a market discontinuity and without a technological one.",Melegati J.; Wang X.,Conference Proceeding,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2018-01-01,Free University of Bozen-Bolzano,Innovativeness ;  Software startups ;  Technology discontinuities
Performance of collaborative technology innovation through co-opetition,"Co-opetitive R&D alliances formed by rivals have become one research focus in the field of strategy alliance and technology innovation. However, the mathematical modeling of co-opetition relationship, in which competing partners perform R&D activities collaboratively, is still lack of exploration. In this paper, a variable named co-opetition factor is particularly developed in the game model, so as to characterize the nature of co-opetition relationship which is indicated by a simultaneous existence of both cooperation and competition logics. Furthermore, we construct a decision function involves another critical factor named knowledge integration degree, which plays a decisive role on success of co-opetition relationship. We find that, when firms are intended to make collaboration with direct rivals to implement R&D activities, they should distinguish the co-opetition intensity with his partner, and choose proper degree of knowledge integration. If and only if the knowledge integration degree could be controlled within a proper interval, the co-opetition relationship could make benefits for partners and contribute to the success of technology innovation.",Li W.; Li C.,Conference Proceeding,"Conference Proceedings of the 6th International Symposium on Project Management, ISPM 2018",2018-01-01,Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications,Alliance ;  Co-opetition ;  Knowledge integration ;  R&D
Software start-ups through an empirical lens: Are start-ups snowflakes?,"Most of the existing research assume that software start-ups are “unique” and require a special approach to software engineering. The uniqueness of start-ups is often justified by the scarcity of resources, time pressure, little operating history, and focus on innovation. As a consequence, most research on software start-ups concentrate on exploring the start-up context and are overlooking the potential of transferring the best engineering practices from other contexts to start-ups. In this paper, we examine results from an earlier mapping study reporting frequently used terms in literature used to characterize start-ups. We analyze how much empirical evidence support each characteristic, and how unique each characteristic is in the context of innovative, market-driven, software-intensive product development. Our findings suggest that many of the terms used to describe startups originate from anecdotal evidence and have little empirical backing. Therefore, there is a potential to revise the original start-up characterization. In conclusion, we identify three potential research avenues for further work: a) considering shareholder perspective in product decisions, b) providing support for software engineering in rapidly growing organizations, and c) focusing on transferring the best engineering practices from other contexts to start-ups.",Klotins E.,Conference Proceeding,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2018-01-01,Blekinge Tekniska Högskola,Engineering context ;  Software engineering ;  Start-ups
Geotechnical properties of phosphogypsum and its use in road engineering,"Phosphogypsum is an industrial waste generated during the production of phosphoric acid. Its amounts in the world are significant and still increase. This waste is mainly stored and its storage is a problem for the natural environment. Road construction industry allows for the use of large amounts of industrial waste, such as fly ash, coal mining waste and metallurgy industry by-products. However, due to its properties, phosphogypsum is a waste with high limitations for use. The research of technical and chemical properties of Phosphogypsum is still being carried out. According to previous studies, the use of unprocessed phosphogypsum in building materials causes deterioration of their properties, therefore processing is required. The paper presents the results of testing phosphogypsum-fly ash mixture and this mixture processed into a granular form with sulphur and various additions of a modifier. The solidification of phosphogypsum into granules was aimed at improving geotechnical properties and reducing the leaching of heavy metals. The paper discusses the geotechnical properties of the mixture before and after granulating it in terms of the possibility of use its in road engineering as the geotechnical structures.

Automotive NVH - Methodology for future innovative product development,"The automotive market is subject to not only a highly competitive environment but also facing introduction of many new technologies spanning from pure electric propulsion systems to advanced driver assistance systems. All of these new technologies together with continuously increasing customer expectations give rise to challenges in the automotive OEM product development as they require a high rate of innovation and development. Additional complexity in terms of new legal regulations, such as vehicle safety, CO2 and noise emission reduction, which often are contradicting, needs consideration during the product development. An efficient and innovative product development organisation yields significant competitive advantages as more product can be put to the market faster for a given cost and time. The refinement of noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) is one the most important tasks in the premium and luxury automotive segments during the vehicle development process. It strongly influences the overall perception of the vehicle together with other attributes such as styling, digital user experience, performance & drivability and vehicle dynamics. The introduction of new technologies, such as electrification and software-controlled systems, result in numerous challenges with respect to NVH requiring cost and weight efficient countermeasures coupled with new simulation and test methods. Consideration to secondary effects caused by trade-off with other attributes is also critical and requires cross-attribute optimisation. Traditional target setting and down-cascading processes through benchmarking is not ready to be applied. Simulation and test methods as well as engineering system solutions derived during the product development relies strongly on experiences from previous programs through closed loop learning. The high rate of innovation with a smaller knowledge basis results in higher risk of failure as many issues may not be foreseen. Therefore, it is important to execute advanced research projects up-front of the ordinary product development projects to address all new concepts and technologies. Focus on closing critical knowledge gaps early in the product development is required. Knowledge gaps may not only be related to the physics of the new technologies but also to customer preferences. Strategies like application of NVH simulator technology and systems engineering and synthesis early in the product development phase should support robust decision making. The need to derive noise and vibration characteristics for critical systems, such as interior sound pressure level or radiated sound power, for different use cases are examples of necessary strategies in future automotive development. In this paper, different application cases from development of new technologies will be discussed.",Sturesson P.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of ISMA 2018 - International Conference on Noise and Vibration Engineering and USD 2018 - International Conference on Uncertainty in Structural Dynamics,2018-01-01,Volvo Car Corporation,
Design for data ethics: Using service design approaches to operationalize ethical principles on four projects,"Ethical frameworks provide helpful guidance about what you should-and should not-do in relation to data projects. But they do not provide definitive yes/no answers about what an ethical data project is or is not. Indeed, research (Ipsos-MORI 2015 Public dialogue into the ethics of data science in government) conducted for the initial development of the Government's Data Ethics Framework shows that the public does not hold any clear red lines; rather, they make nuanced assessments based on a number of variables, including public good and privacy. Ethical frameworks provide a list of these variables to consider in shaping the form of the work. Some are now starting to provide more practical tools and guidance to reshape data projects and push it along those variables into a more ethical space. Alongside technical tools, service design approaches can help enhance the degree to which a data project is ethical, and provides a toolkit for data scientists, analysts and policymakers to take projects from 'what should we do' to 'how can we do it'. This paper sets out the emergence of data science ethical frameworks within the context of the use of data for social good, and-with the recent release of the updated UK Government Data Ethics Framework-shows the recognition more practical guidance needs to be provided. The author then argues that service design approaches provide a helpful 'wrap around' for data projects, and draws on experience in using service design tools on four projects, as well as wider examples.

Process innovation in service sector matching industry 4.0 environment,"In Industry 4.0 era two types of innovative development are receiving more attention: service innovation and industrial big data. The main outcome of the paper is a normative model design of decision-making on service innovation concerning outsourcing. This model combines both financial and non-financial criteria. The model also helps managers better understand the value engineering nature of outsourcing and offers clear and understandable normative decision-making model. The research, which was completed in 2017, was specifically based on questionnaire survey which was performed among mid-level management in the Czech and Slovak Republic. In total 89 companies were subjected to survey. This survey was complemented by contextual interviews with selected maintenance managers. The research confirmed the firms were not experienced enough to predict the future role of outsourcing matching organizational changes in Industry 4.0 environment. The literature review proved, that not similar model hasn´t been presented yet. The model was practically verified on the pattern of mid-sized company. Based on research outcomes the examination of maintenance outsourcing was conducted in production, service and trading sector.

Measuring formation strain to determine hydraulic connectivity using fiber optic distributed acoustic sensing,"Advanced methods in reservoir characterization are required to effectively harness geothermal energy from fractured high-temperature crystalline rock. It is critical to determine sufficient fluid connection between water influx and production wells to enhance thermal recovery and optimize the lifetime of the reservoir. GeoMechanics Technologies, in collaboration with California State University, Long Beach (CSULB) and Silixa LLC, is working in cooperation with the Department of Energy, Small Business Innovation Research through DOE SBIR Grant No: DE-SC-0017744 to investigate the use of fiber optic Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) to improve geothermal reservoir characterization. We use DAS to measure inter-well dynamic strain in response to periodic injection. The attenuation and phase lag between injection stress and strain are used to determine hydraulic connectivity in fractured bedrock. Fiber optic distributed sensing technology is capable of withstanding high temperature and pressure conditions typical of geothermal reservoirs. This tool would provide nearly continuous dynamic strain and temperature monitoring along the length of the wellbore, providing knowledge into hydraulic pathways even where perforations do not exist. Also, real-time measurements can be obtained throughout the lifetime of the well, ideally accounting for any changes in operations or reservoir configurations or thermally induced changes in permeability. The objective of this research effort was to investigate and document the use of fiber optic DAS for measuring the hydromechanical response caused by fracture dilation in a reservoir and determine how that correlates to reservoir connectivity. Our team has successfully performed numerical simulations, laboratory testing, and a field demonstration to further validate the effectiveness of DAS technology for detecting formation hydraulics.",Oliver N.; Bruno M.; Diessl J.; Lao K.; Becker M.; Coleman T.,Conference Proceeding,Transactions - Geothermal Resources Council,2018-01-01,"Silixa Ltd;California State University, Long Beach;GeoMechanics Technologies",Acoustic Sensing ;  Fiber Optics ;  Geothermal ;  Hydraulic Connectivity ;  Strain

Numerous studies have been carried out on the various aspects of PSS, such as design, management, business model, ICT, remanufacturing, etc. Meanwhile, these studies were published in a diverse set of journals in many subject categories, such as operations, service, marketing, environment, innovation, engineering design etc. In this context, it is necessary to map PSS literatures in order to better understand the current research progress and future research directions in terms of knowledge creation, diffusion and utilization. For this purpose, this study performs bibliometric analysis to map the available literature of the PSS research field. This is crucial to help scholars in identifying and conducting new and innovative research within their discipline. The following analyses were performed in this study: i) number of articles and proceeding papers per year, ii) number of articles by author, iii) number of papers by source, iv) most cited papers, v) most used keywords, and vii) keywords network. The main differentiator of this study to previous ones is the inclusion of conference proceedings to reflect the novelty of the topic.",Khan M.; Wuest T.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management,2018-01-01,Benjamin M.

Interdisciplinary cooperation management in research clusters: A review of twelve years,"As an interdisciplinary research network, the Cluster of Excellence “Integrative Production Technology for High-Wage Countries” (CoE) comprises of around 150 researchers. Their scientific background ranges from mechanical engineering and computer science to social sciences such as sociology and psychology. In addition to content- and method-based challenges, the CoE's employees are faced with heterogenic organizational cultures, different hierarchical levels, an imbalanced gender distribution, and a high employee fluctuation. The sub-project Scientific Cooperation Engineering 1 (CSP1) addresses the challenge of interdisciplinary cooperation and organizational learning and aims at fostering interdisciplinarity and its synergies as a source of innovation. Therefore, the project examines means of reaching an organizational development, ranging from temporal structures to a sustainable network in production technology. To achieve this aim, a broad range of means has been developed during the last twelve years: In addition to physical measures such as regular network events and trainings, virtual measures such as the Terminology App were focused. The app is an algorithmic analysis method for uncovering latent topic structures of publications of the CoE to highlight thematic intersections and synergy potentials. The detection and promotion of has been a vital and long known element in knowledge management. Furthermore, CSP1 focusses on project management and thus developed evaluation tools to measure and control the success of interdisciplinary cooperation. In addition to the cooperation fostering measures, CSP1 conducted studies about interdisciplinarity and diversity and their relationship with innovation. The scientific background of these means and the research results of CSP1 are outlined in this paper to offer approaches for successful interdisciplinary cooperation management.",Müller-Abdelrazeq S.; Brauner P.; Calero-Valdez A.; Jansen U.; Platte L.; Schaar A.; Steuer L.; Zachow S.; Schönefeld K.; Haberstroh M.; Leicht-Scholten C.; Ziefle M.; Isenhardt I.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Intellectual Capital, Knowledge Management and Organisational Learning, ICICKM",2018-01-01,Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen;Nonlinear Dynamics of Laser Manufacturing Processes Instruction and Research Department (NLD);Institute of Information Management in Mechanical Engineering (IMA),Cluster of Excellence ;  Human Resource Management ;  Interdisciplinarity ;  Interdisciplinary Cooperation ;  Research Organization
Connecting academia and small enterprises: A new field for Knowledge Management Experiments,"Digital transformation is becoming a main issue for every small and medium-sized enterprise (SME). The rise of software as a service is an opportunity for them to innovate their business processes; however, the lack of digital knowledge and resources is often perceived as a barrier to starting a digital transformation. Therefore, a field experiment was conducted to explore two designs of digital platforms with the purpose of reducing those barriers. The final design uses the open innovation approach with a standardized methodology for leading projects over three months. These projects bring together students and SMEs to look for process innovations and to assess the firms' readiness for starting digital transformations. A total of twenty-nine companies and twenty-two students tested different methods to collaborate on the platform. Students applied methods such as Business Process Modeling, the Value Proposition Canvas, the Results Pyramid, and the Absorptive Capacity model to analyze the SMEs. Until now, open innovation literature has gathered case studies on companies' strategies to innovate their products without paying enough attention to process innovation. This paper aims to demonstrate the potential and limitations of a platform managed by academia to support SMEs in the adoption of new digital practices. Using the knowledge management theory, we assess the platform through five lenses: creation, validation, presentation, distribution, and application of new knowledge. Based on the different designs and approaches tested during a two-year experiment, the paper points out the best practices for this specific context. As a conclusion, a framework to replicate the experiment is presented with suggestions to improve the knowledge management process between students and SMEs.",Cavillier Q.; Wieser P.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Intellectual Capital, Knowledge Management and Organisational Learning, ICICKM",2018-01-01,École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne,Action research ;  Digital platform ;  Knowledge management system ;  Open innovation ;  SMEs

Effectiveness of e-learning experience through online quizzes: A case study of Myanmar students,"Universities in developing counties have come to understand that relying on only traditional classrooms is not sufficient to advance students' knowledge and skills. The rapid development of information systems and internet technology has brought many educational innovations that can eliminate the boundaries of conventional teaching and learning. However, universities and their members including students are still experiencing challenges in understanding how to access e-learning practically and what type of direct benefits can be gained before e-learning can be implemented at their universities. Consequently, this study develops a pilot program for e-learning content based on quizzes and delivers that content to inexperienced students. The current work aims to measure the effectiveness of e-learning experiences on students after practicing through online quizzes. The findings indicate that students have better grades on their final post-test, which was taken after self-study and practice with online quizzes. All the third-year students (24 students in total) from the Department of Computer Engineering and Information Technology (CEIT), Yangon Technological University (YTU), Myanmar, participated in these pilot e-learning tests. The paper also examines the relationships among e-learning study-time, number of accesses, the number of online activities, the number of quiz activities and the improvements in outcomes of students.

NASA’s 2040 vision roadmap study: A framework for Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME),"Over the last few decades, advances in high-performance computing, new materials characterization methods, and, more recently, an emphasis on integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) and additive manufacturing have been a catalyst for multiscale modeling and simulation-based design of materials and structures in the aerospace industry. While these advances have driven significant progress in the development of aerospace components and systems, that progress has been limited by persistent technology and infrastructure challenges that must be overcome to realize the full potential of integrated materials and systems design and simulation modeling throughout the supply chain. As a result, NASA’s Transformational Tools and Technology (TTT) Project sponsored an industry led study to define the potential 25-year future state required for integrated multiscale modeling of materials and systems (e.g., load-bearing structures) to accelerate the pace and reduce the expense of innovation in future aerospace and aeronautical systems. Herein the overall findings of this 2040 Vision study will be briefly reviewed, with an emphasis toward those applicable to ICME of composites. These findings for example include the 2040 vision state; the required interdependent core technical work areas defined as Key Elements (KE); associated critical gaps and actions to close those gaps; and major recommendations. The 2040 Vision Study is a community consensus document. The study envisions, as a 2040 end-state, the development of a cyber-physical-social ecosystem (comprised of experimentally verified and validated computational models, tools, and techniques, along with the associated digital tapestry) that impacts the entire supply chain to enable cost-effective, rapid, and revolutionary design of fit-for-purpose materials, components, and systems. It is NASA’s hope and desire that this roadmap provides the strategic guidance to both public and private research and development decision makers to make the proposed 2040 vision state a reality and thereby provides a significant advancement in the United States global competitiveness.",Arnold S.,Conference Proceeding,33rd Technical Conference of the American Society for Composites 2018,2018-01-01,NASA Glenn Research Center,
"Digitalization of public reporting duties: Promotion of diffusion through lean, rule-based reporting services","The principle of formalizing laws and ordinances and of applying a rule-based approach to automating reporting duties has been embraced by research and the eGovernment avant-garde for many years. A prominent example is P23R, a holistic approach for engineering seamless B2G-processes. P23R represents a domain-independent IT infrastructure for automating public reporting duties of any kind and thus reduces bureaucracy costs. Despite its proven benefits, the P23R approach has not yet found its way into broad usage. To determine possible reasons for this, diffusion theory is drawn upon as a model of explanation. Everett Rogers, one of the most prominent advocates of diffusion theory, stipulated several factors that promote or hinder the diffusion of innovations. Based on this, Steffens identified a number of hindering factors for the P23R diffusion. To overcome these barriers, a lean solution model is proposed: Light-weight rule-based reporting services that realize only one or a few reporting duties. Light-weight reporting services are based on P23R rules and components; similar to microservices, they are self-contained and executable, and thus do not require the user to operate a full-fledged P23R infrastructure. Market acceptance of rule-based reporting services will greatly depend on an ecosystem and its network effects that incite software industry to develop rules and components for reporting services and at the same time meet users’ needs for certified service quality. An ecosystem and a platform model are proposed, which assume a multisided market of network partners for rule, component, and service provision as well as organizational structures for quality certification under government control. The paper provides answers to the following questions: What are hindering and promoting factors for the diffusion of a rule-based domain-independent approach to eGovernment? How can microservices support the diffusion of such an approach? What is a possible ecosystem for developing a networked market for eGovernment services?.",Steffens P.; Gottschick J.; Wolf P.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the European Conference on e-Government, ECEG",2018-01-01,Fraunhofer Institute for Open Communication Systems FOKUS;Capgemini,B2G ;  Bureaucratic load ;  Diffusion theory ;  EGovernment services ;  P23R ;  Rule-based eGovernment
Patents and nanotechnology innovation in Mexico,"Background: This paper examines nanotechnology patents in Mexico to gain some insights into: a) the growth of patents over the last twenty years; b) the distribution of assignee patents between private and public institutions; b) the economic sectors engaged in nanotechnology R&D; and, c) whether R&D is oriented to basic research or more applied science and engineering. Method: The present research employs the DG concordance system. This approach establishes a procedure to match patents according to their potential use in economic sectors. The research incorporates a two-stage approach, each involving a different method: capturing basic information from Mexican nanotechnology patents; and, establishing concordance with economic sectors. Results: 217 patents were identified; 153 were analyzed. Private companies and individuals registered 30 %. The largest concentration (41%) is found in the economic sector “Manufacture of Chemicals and Chemical Products”. Most patents are located in basic research. There are virtually no patents related to the final place in the value chain (final products) or to nanotechnology instruments. Conclusion: The article provides an overview of nanotechnology in Mexico in terms of quantity and institutional allocation of patents; also with the economic sectors with which they are associated, and the relation with the place in a value chain. Patent concentration in public academic institutions suggests a lack of nanotechnology research and development capacity in firms. Most patents are related to electronics, an economic sector with significant development in the country.",Foladori G.; Belmont E.; Figueroa E.; Appelbaum R.; Lau E.,Journal,Recent Patents on Nanotechnology,2018-01-01,"Instituto de Investigaciones en Matemáticas Aplicadas y en Sistemas;University of California, Santa Barbara;Universidad Autónoma de Zacatecas",Concordance methods ;  Economic sectors ;  Mexico ;  Nanotechnology ;  Patents ;  Value chain

Electro-photonics: An emerging field for photonic integrated circuits,"Electro-Photonics combines the best of both electronics and optics to tackle the challenges of next generation optical communication networks in terms of capacity, flexibility, and energy efficiency. The optimal sharing of the processing work load between the electrical and optical domain brings considerable benefits to communication system complexity, performance, and construction as well as operational cost. As a key technology, photonic integrated circuits (PICs) play a critical role for the implementation of signal processing in the optical domain, serving for signal generation, switching, and acquisition. PICs point to advancing of network devices such as transmitters, receivers, and switches with desirable features of large bandwidth, high stability, precise control, easy tuning, and potential for low-cost fabrication by enabling miniaturization of complex optical systems on a chip scale. In this paper, we review the PIC research progress of the Monash Electro-Photonics Laboratory and its major contributions to the fields of optical communications and microwave photonics. We focus on applications in optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (O-OFDM), Nyquist wavelength division multiplexing (N-WDM), optical pulse manipulation, and programmable optical processors. The results of these works underline not only hardware fabrication capability and performance improvement for electrophotonics, but, more importantly, a new engineering paradigm that stimulates innovations in information and communication technologies.",Zhuang L.; Lowery A.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,2018-01-01,Monash University,Integrated optics ;  Microwave photonics ;  Optical communications ;  Optical signal processing ;  Photonic integrated circuits ;  Waveguide
Mayor’s dilemma: Combining game design with microeconomic game theory,"Societal transformations like the German Energiewende rely not only on technical innovations and political measures but also on the economic support of the public. It is important to take into account how distributional issues have to be considered for acceptance of the political goals according the Energiewende and which economic instruments in order to internalise the external effects of energy consumption are most efficient. To generate empirical data for analysing economic decisions, we developed an app, which emphasises on game principles to generate an immersive setting and to translate abstract decisions into a visible outcome related to the idea of good life. Moreover, our app utilises the design of simulation games while recording user data. Implementing our own game analytics routines, we are able to track the decisions of the users for empirical research on user behaviour. Starting the app three players have to adopt the role of city mayors. They are guided through three stages. In the lobby they have to choose their city arms, which are related to specific types of electricity generation. We provide a set of energy related symbols giving the following urban development an individual and visual outcome. In the main part of the app the player has to invest a given amount in her city, while the two other mayors do the same. The players do not see the decisions of the others, while the actual values of the investment is depend on one another. During ten rounds the look of the city district of each player is changed according to the chosen city arm and in line with the individual outcome of the investments of all mayors. With the underlying asset database, the city will grow and show moments of life. Every player creates her own city. By means of different game setups, we investigate whether and to what extent the mayors' investments deviate from the Nash equilibrium prediction.

Project-Based Learning to Develop Creative Abilities in Students,"This article describes project-based learning as innovative pedagogical technology, able to transform the learning process in order to develop creative abilities in students. A survey among Pedagogical Major students of the Kyrgyz National Agrarian University named after K. I. Skryabin (KNAU), Engineering Department, showed that most of the students are not familiar with technologies facilitating creativity and have not enough abilities for creative activities. Among the instructors working more than 3 years, there is only a small part who considers themselves competent in the creative approach to arranging the learning process. At the social-pedagogical level, this defines the significance of researching the creative ability promotion problem via project-based learning in universities. The novelty of this article is that in the current educational condition of the KNAU, there is making an effort to implement into “Rhetoric"", a new subject of the teaching package, the elements of the project-based learning to encourage students’ creative abilities. During completing this work authors used a complex set of methods in order to address the objective and ensure results of high credibility such as: theoretical analysis of pedagogical ideas, lessons’ observation, analysis of students’ works, pedagogical experiments, sociological study methods, and mathematical statistic methods. In educational practice, this method was tested and had good responses among the fourth course students on specialty “Professional Education"". Using the method of project training, each student developed a scheme for conducting an interactive session individually that provided the creativity approach. Ten out of 16 students participated in this activity. Analytical work included several stages allowing for the improvement of logical thinking, revealing maximum creative abilities and encouraging scientific research.",Isabekov A.; Sadyrova G.,Book Series,Technical and Vocational Education and Training,2018-01-01,Kyrgyz National Agrarian University named after K.

Novel measurement techniques and measurement methods for the determination of ultrasound noise exposure at work places,"Ultrasound technology is widely used in industrial and medical technology and, thus, a significant increase in the number of workplaces exposed to airborne ultrasound has been registered. Although it is assumed that airborne ultrasound cannot be heard it can be perceived by humans and this has led to reports about various adverse effects. A thorough investigation of the noise exposure, based on proven and traceable measurements, is indispensable to ensure a contemporary occupational safety quality. Since no standardised methods and measurement techniques exist to date, appropriate technology is developed in a project funded by the European Metrology Programme for Innovation and Research (EMPIR) and results are presented in this contribution. Measurement set-ups were developed that allow the determination of sound fields with the required wide frequency bandwidth and high spatial resolution. By the aid of these techniques the 3-dimensional sound pressure distribution around a representative ultrasound welding machine was determined. Simplified measurement methods were developed that can be applied by measurement service technicians. For this purpose, sound level meters with an extended frequency range and analysis tools were developed. This work contributes to an improvement of the assessment of ultrasound noise at workplaces and, thus, to improve the occupational safety quality.",Schöneweiß R.; Wächtler M.; Kling C.; Koch C.,Conference Proceeding,"25th International Congress on Sound and Vibration 2018, ICSV 2018: Hiroshima Calling",2018-01-01,Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt,Airborne ultrasound ;  Occupational safety ;  Sound field measurement ;  Sound level meter

Towards industrial revolution 4.0: Employers' expectations on fresh engineering graduates,"From the pass until now, the industry was affected by technological change and innovation. These paradigms are called industrial revolutions. These revolutions were caused by mechanization (1st industrial revolution), use of electrical energy (2nd industrial revolution) and electronics and automation (3rd industrial revolution). All these industrial revolutions did influence only the production itself, but also the labour market and the educational system as well. Currently, due to the development of digitalization and robotics, we are facing the next industrial revolution, known as the Industry Revolution 4.0. The emerging technologies have huge effect on the education of people. Only qualified and highly educated employees will be able to control these technologies. The skills needed by employers' in the Industry 4.0 have change due to the changes of the technologies. In this paper, we present the non-technical skills those are demanded by employers' in Industry 4.0 based on recent studies by doing metaanalysis technique. In addition, interviews with five employers have been done to clarify the metaanalysis results. Based on the results, the non-technical skills which are demanded by employers are communication skills especially in English, teamwork skills, critical thinking and problem-solving skills, entrepreneur skills and computer skills.

Deriving functional requirements for industry 4.0 from industry’s assessment of needs,"Functional requirements (FRs) are derived from perceptions of needs expressed at workshops by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) organized to identify the requirements of SMEs to introduce Industry 4.0 in their company Rather than good expressions of customer needs (CNs), SME representatives often propose partial physical solutions, such as a robot, rather than basic needs, like orient and load parts. In Axiomatic Design (AD) the CNs are used to formulate FRs, which should be solution-neutral, to provide a large solution space, facilitating creativity and innovation in the design process. The workshops, as part of Horizons 2020 EU project, aimed to gain customer needs from SME's so that these needs could be researched and answered in future research These partial solutions proposed by the SMEs are analyzed in order to reverse engineer customer needs and functional requirements. These same reverse engineering methods also could be used to derive FRs from existing design solutions and could aid inexperienced designers who struggle to generate good, solution-neutral FRs that are appropriately devoid of physical attributes. Previous works are using a similar approach to taking the customers’ proposed partial solutions and reverse engineering the FRs and CNs.",Vickery A.; Rauch E.; Brown C.,Conference Proceeding,Advances in Transdisciplinary Engineering,2018-01-01,Worcester Polytechnic Institute;Free University of Bozen-Bolzano,Axiomatic design ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Requirement analysis ;  Small and medium sized enterprises ;  System design
The toyota kata approach for lean product development,"There are several benefits reported in literature related to the adoption of lean in development environments, as rework reduction, innovation and an increase in value adding. However, there is a few literature regarding how to manage uncertainties, to integrate developers, to maximize the knowledge sharing and minimize its losses in a lean product development environment. The Toyota Kata approach enables the establishment of management routines that can conduct the development process, deal with uncertainties, stimulate organizational learning and integrate and align all development team towards the development goals. This paper aims to demonstrate how the Toyota Kata approach can be used in a Lean Product Development environment and to present the initial results of its application in the development of an innovative product, a magnetic refrigerator. Initially, a literature review was performed. Then, a model for Toyota Kata in Lean Product Development environments was developed.

Transdisciplinary engineering research challenges,"Transdisciplinary research (TDR) has been the subject of discourse in the past few decades, but has bot been studied much in the context of engineering problems. Many engineering problems can be characterized as ill-defined, like open innovation, adoption of new technology, business development, and the adoption of the Industry 4.0 concept. Transdisciplinary engineering research (TDER) is also performed in large projects by multi-disciplinary teams, as in TDR projects, including stakeholders and people from practice. Such projects may last long, often years. In such large projects, the involved disciplines should include both engineering disciplines as well as disciplines from social sciences. In this paper we address the challenges that exist in adopting a TDER approach. Universities need to prepare students to work in TDER projects. We discuss the current situation in transdisciplinary engineering education (TDEE) and identify challenges that need to be addressed for including TDEE in curricula. The paper ends with a summary and ideas for further research.",Wognum N.; Bil C.; Elgh F.; Peruzzini M.; Stjepandić J.; Verhagen W.,Conference Proceeding,Advances in Transdisciplinary Engineering,2018-01-01,Jönköping University;RMIT University;Delft University of Technology;Università degli Studi di Modena e Reggio Emilia;PROSTEP AG,Transdisciplinary engineering education ;  Transdisciplinary engineering research
Bpmn applied to the automation of an integrated product development process oriented to the r&d projects of the Brazilian electrical sector,"The lack of models for the development of products oriented to the R&D projects of the Brazilian Electrical Sector generated the need of specific knowledge for this purpose. Aiming to close this gap Pereira and Canciglieri Júnior (2014) have structured the Integrated Product Development Model-Oriented to the Research and Development Projects (MOP&D), a conceptual model, that uses the principals of concurrent engineering, to support the R&D projects foreseen by the Brazilian Electric Energy National Agency’s (ANEEL) Innovation Chain composed of six modules. The model has been validated through case studies but has no user interface for the application. Thus, to make this features tangible, this article proposes the use of the tools from the Business Process Modeling and Notation (BPMN), considered the de-facto standard for the representation of the process, for the modeling and automation of the MOP&D. To reach this objective it was proposed the automation of the three last modules of the chain. At first, it was made a Systematic Bibliographic Review regarding the theme, then the modeling of the modules process was developed, followed by its automation using an appropriate engine. The Systematic Bibliographic Review showed that the application of BPMN for modeling Product Development Process is scarce but suitable. The automation proposed in this article provides the multidisciplinary team a consistent vehicle for the correct execution of the modules as structured in the MOP&D, with a decision support system based on process integration taking in to account the concurrent engineering parameters stated in the model.",do Val da FONSECA M.; Canciglieri Junior O.,Conference Proceeding,Advances in Transdisciplinary Engineering,2018-01-01,Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Paraná,BPMN ;  Electrical Sector ;  Integrated Product Development Process ;  MOP&D ;  R&D
Application of the design thinking method determining the needs of the users of the integrated heritage buildings renovation assessment platform,"Building renovation and the improvement of their energy efficiency are currently relevant both in the European Union member states and elsewhere. It is argued that building renovation should not be limited to the renovation of structure and building insulation, but should take into consideration the surrounding environment, aesthetic, social, economic context etc. This is of crucial importance in the case of renovation of heritage buildings. The renovation, adaptation to the present day needs and improvement of energy efficiency of heritage buildings in some extent is a part of the general process of building renovation, but together it encompasses other social, cultural, heritage preservation, economic, and life-cycle aspects non-related to conventional building renovation. This encourages to change the existing practice of assessment of renovation of heritage buildings, where buildings are evaluated separately using energy and heritage related criteria, and to develop the sustainable heritage buildings renovation assessment system integrating heritage preservation, energy, environmental, and social-economic criteria. Such system must be user friendly and accessible to the professionals of different fields including heritage preservation, architecture, civil engineering etc. and should allow to evaluate as much as possible comprehensively the change of heritage building and its impact on environment and society. This makes the development of such system or tool a very complex task. Thinking of the approach that would enable comprehending the needs of the potentialy different users of the system and to find working and innovative ways of integrating heritage preservation, energy, environmental, and social-economic dimensions, we have selected the Design Thinking approach as human-centered strategy for innovation. In this research we elaborate and specify the five standard stages (Empathise, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test) in the Design Thinking process to fit our specific task regarding assessment of heritage buildings renovation.",Grazuleviciute-Vileniske I.; Seduikyte L.,Conference Proceeding,REHABEND,2018-01-01,Kaunas University of Technology,Assessment ;  Design Thinking method ;  Heritage building ;  Renovation
Designing a prototype training environment for physiotherapists building on advanced gaming technologies,"Recent years have seen the proliferation of digital games in areas beyond entertainment. Serious games have quickly gained momentum in professional training, as they allow for authentic learning experiences that are closely aligned to real-world issues, problems, and applications, provide immersion, and incorporate the essential ingredients of training: critical thinking, awareness of emotions, (collaborative) knowledge construction, creative problem solving and innovation. Incorporating advanced AR/VR technologies, serious games are revolutionising fields like medical training, which traditionally relies on textbook-based theoretical education and clinical placements. The paper first discusses the important role that gaming technologies increasingly play in training healthcare professionals and reviews state-of-the-art applications and best practice in the field, to then investigate the requirements and present the design of a prototype training environment for physiotherapists that builds on advanced gaming technologies. This professional group is purposely selected due to the inherent complexity of physical therapy, a type of treatment that encompasses a wide variety of aspects (kinesiology, physiology, pathophysiology, etc) and takes place in various healthcare settings. Physiotherapy refers to the recovery, improvement, and maintenance of a person’s movement abilities. Physiotherapists should be able to analyse and assess the functional and physical state of a person, treat by movement, compensate disability, guarantee health care and prevention, and stimulate and educate healthy living. They are also called to manage psychological issues that impact rehabilitation. Physiotherapist training is a continuous process aimed at keeping professionals constantly up to date with new scientific insights, methods, technologies and tools. Advanced gaming technologies can allow physiotherapists to gain a greater understanding of possible therapeutic interventions and develop their clinical reasoning and decision making in the selection and justification of their chosen therapeutic approach. The paper applies the Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM) to design a suitable training solution for the promotion of authentic, comprehensive learning. Within the proposed system design, augmented reality modules are embedded alongside the game simulation and virtual world environment to provide participants with an authentic simulated game scenario in which to immerse themselves.",Pappa D.; Papadopoulos H.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the European Conference on e-Learning, ECEL",2018-01-01,"Institute of Informatics & Telecommunications;National Centre for Scientific Research ""DEMOKRITOS""",E-learning ;  Professional training ;  Serious games
Interactive effects of technology innovation on the innovation capacity of enterprise information system-from the perspective of sociomateriality,"Innovation capacity of enterprise information system (EIS) is imperative capacity required by enterprises under the “Internet+” circumstance. To improve innovation capacity of EIS, this paper deals with the direct and interactive effects of technology innovation on the innovation capacity of EIS from the perspective of sociomateriality. Firstly, we explore material and social factors of technology innovation from the view of sociomateriality. Then, using structural equation model (SEM) with product-item analysis, we analyze the reliability and validity of the survey data by SPSS20.0 and AMOS20.0, and the results show that the material and social factors of technology innovation, as well as the interaction between them have positive direct influence on the EIS innovation capacity.

Survey of business excellence by knowledge gathering for industrial internet-of-things applications,"The internet-of-things (IoT) can change not only products but also companies’ whole business model. The goal of this article is to inform companies about the creation of business intelligence via utilisation of the industrial IoT. This review article assumes that combining business excellence, service design and knowledge gathering via data engineering into cognitive infocommunication (CogInfoCom) opens new possibilities to develop business ideas. These new possibilities are examined through a literature review on deployments of industrial IoT solutions. The survey responds to two research questions: what methods of knowledge gathering and business excellence are used in industrial IoT-based product, service and process innovations? How can knowledge gathering, business excellence and CogInfoCom methods be utilised to create added value in industrial IoT solutions? This survey reveals the richness and delicacy of these exploitation opportunities.",Tervonen J.; Hautamäki J.; Heikkilä M.; Isoherranen V.,Journal,International Journal of Management and Enterprise Development,2018-01-01,Oulun Yliopisto;Centria University of Applied Sciences;Centria University of Applied Sciences,Business excellence ;  Business intelligence ;  Business process management ;  Case studies in industry ;  Cognitive data communication ;  Computational intelligence ;  Data engineering ;  Data mining ;  Development ;  Enterprise modelling ;  Industrial internet-of-things ;  Knowledge-intensive service design ;  Literature review ;  Management ;  Management ;  Operational maturity review
Quality control of electric power project for water treatment from the perspective of innovation,"In recent years, water pollution has attracted much attention. There are more and more electric engineering projects based on water treatment, and its quality control becomes very urgent. These projects are directly oriented to the public, which are important facilities for power grid enterprises to undertake social responsibility, serve local people's livelihood and economic development, and establish corporate brand and external image. At the same time, it is also the key link to ensure the power resources can be allocated and utilized. In reality, the development of power construction involves many specialties, high quality service requirements, and great influence by local government policies and economic environment. The success of the project depends directly on the quality management of the project. Project quality management level is one of the important criteria to reflect whether an enterprise has the core competitiveness. However, there are many shortcomings and shortcomings in the current quality management methods and models of power project construction in china. This paper will take the electric power engineering project as the research object, redesign the quality control process, focused on solving the quality control problem of electric power engineering project and provide a realistic reference for the quality control of electric power engineering project.",Wang H.; Fu J.,Trade Journal,Paper Asia,2018-01-01,"Northwest University;Shaanxi Shen Wei Coal Pipeline Transportation Co., Ltd",Electric power project ;  Quality control
Reflections on an industrial design curriculum paradigm shift from material production to behaviour change by practice based on a case study,"This article narrates on work towards a new industrial design curriculum launched in 2016. The makeover promoted transitioning from traditional design education focused on both, industrial age manufacturing and first-generation Bloom’s taxonomy, to recent expressions of new product development and innovation driven by constructionism and social constructivism. It integrates design research, heuristics, human-centred design, human-computer interaction, participatory design, user experience, STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and design, and mathematics) and CDIO (conceiving, designing, implementing and operating) frameworks. The new approach upgraded expected final outcomes from concept proposal to proving practically how solutions work, operate and their likelihood for user adoption. A water conservation project for a household serves as metaphor of that shift from material production to behaviour change with a third-generation activity theory and artefact mediation analysis. Designers and users participated as co-designers in an organisational and design intervention to improve sustainability awareness and performance. Water is a premium commodity because its scarcity. Research showed the most likely influence to change habit in a family came from their shared construction of knowledge based on their interaction. Instead of applying normative measures that were often seen as penalty. Design as persuasion was also essential for confirming habit change. Results made the project a students’ benchmark because it’s working prototype as unique value proposition and minimum viable product with prospect for user adoption and industry take up for manufacturing. The project also evidenced favourable and disparaging steps in the process of new curriculum implementation and redefinition of design as value adding.",Novoa M.; Mubin O.; Apalakis A.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education, E and PDE 2018",2018-01-01,Western Sydney University,Activity Theory ;  CDIO ;  Curriculum Development ;  Human-Centred Design ;  Participatory Action Research ;  STEAM
Design tools in materials teaching: Bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and professional practice,"The industrial panorama increasingly calls for multidisciplinary design professionals who integrate design thinking and engineering knowledge in developing new products and services. Taking into account this need, a practical experience was designed to combine the traditional theoretical framework of materials selection with industrial case studies application. This work explores the results of five one-week workshops conducted in collaboration with materials producers and manufacturing companies. Following the Ashby’s method, students applied a “Reverse materials selection” process to identify the applied materials and manufacturing solutions, without having any information about the current employed solutions. The students, then, were called to design innovative concepts by changing the materials the components were made of. The outcomes of this research are 48 product concepts, elaborated by 154 design students from 2013 to 2017. The works have been evaluated according to the materials selection process applied and the possible levers of material-driven innovation that emerged from the analysis (e.g., technological, functional or aesthetical/sensorial). From this, work emerges that materials selection could be a powerful driver for materials and products innovation. The proposed workshop methodology represents a win-win strategy for both university and industry: it improves the education quality, allowing students to acquire a professional-based knowledge about the materials and technologies most used in specific market contexts. The bottom-up approach helps designers in producing a more “aware design” and in exploiting the potentials and limits of the solutions already employed by the industry, envisioning the possible application of promising materials and technological advances.",Piselli A.; Dastoli C.; Santi R.; Del Curto B.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education, E and PDE 2018",2018-01-01,Politecnico di Milano;National Interuniversity Consortium of Materials Science and Technology,Design education ;  Material-Driven Innovation ;  Materials knowledge ;  Materials selection ;  University-industry collaboration
Mybias: A web-based tool to overcome communication issues and foster creativity in heterogeneous design teams,"The authors, who are researchers and teachers in the field of Design and Engineering, have developed an area of study that deals with the role of biases in heterogeneous teams’ dynamics. In particular they designed, prototyped and tested a web-based exploratory tool called Mybias, aimed at building mutual understanding in heterogeneous teams by making designers more aware of their personal biases when facing a new design issue. Mybias is designed to be used at the very beginning of the design process, the exploratory research. Yet during the first year of development the authors realised that it is worth investigating the effect of the tool on the whole design process. Thus, we decided to experiment with the tool in a real design process by letting 79 students use it during their design studio course, in the context of a Design and Engineering Master Course. The students received the design brief from the teachers and the partner company, later they used the tool to explore the brief and finally they freely used the tool’s output (a set of cards) during the creative phase that was supported by the teachers through a brainstorming session. Feedback on the use of the tools was gathered by a questionnaire. Authors did direct observation during the brainstorming session and qualitative unstructured interviews to a few students at the end of the studio. In the paper the authors discuss the output of this experimentation. It seems that Mybias, a tool designed to support mutual understating among heterogeneous team members, might also support and improve the idea generation and foster creativity by consequently being useful for innovation purposes.",Mattioli F.; Ferraris S.; Ferraro V.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education, E and PDE 2018",2018-01-01,Politecnico di Milano,Biases ;  Exploratory tools ;  Generative tools ;  HCD tool
A framework for students to visualise the implications of design decisions in global supply networks,"Engineering innovation is recognised as a key to business success. Transitions to new business models, including Design & Make supply networks and through-life support services such as the Rolls-Royce TotalCare® package are creating new kinds of innovation opportunities through entire supply networks. Engineering and other graduates need improved supply chain awareness and skills to operate effectively in these emerging innovation contexts. In contrast, the coverage of practical supply chain issues in universities’ engineering curricula tends to be limited. Reasons for this include limited access to industrialists with practical supply chain experience and limited linkage to research which is largely carried out in business schools, with a focus on the firm, rather than the focus on products, services and associated innovation processes that are more relevant to engineers. This paper introduces a pragmatic framework that has been designed to raise awareness in engineering undergraduates of where engineering innovation happens in global supply networks and how the behaviour of individual organisations impacts overall network performance.",McKay A.; Baker R.; Chittenden R.; De Pennington A.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education, E and PDE 2018",2018-01-01,University of Leeds;Rolls-Royce plc,Design & make networks ;  Discrete event simulation ;  Innovation ;  Systems design vee
Introducing tangible aesthetics: Contrasting the introduction of aesthetic analysis tools for product designers and interdisciplinary design researchers,"Design and aesthetics are two intrinsic words that naturally interrelate when a tangible object with formal qualities is developed by taking into account visible parameters. In this research, we describe how an aesthetic analysis of tangible objects could be a valuable and rich pedagogic medium for design research in a design innovation and interdisciplinary design research environment. By comparing the results gained from the application of this method delivered through a series of postgraduate student workshops we describe how “designing aesthetic miscommunication” facilitates learning across disciplines for supporting self-criticality and reflection. This results from the different associated meanings each discipline assigns through perception of objective and subjective aesthetic readings. Our method included combining physical artefacts with a diagrammatical aesthetic mapping framework designed to build mental models of aesthetic analysis, but also to introduce issues and conjectures. Even though various approaches have been applied to the product design discipline including affordances and semantic theory, this method explores a different kind of approach when applied to a more diverse audience. Under this lens visual design analysis facilitates discussion across disciplines and creates a common ground through the perceived visual truths that emerge in the workshops. Our findings have shown that students are capable of maintaining the original meaning shaped by their discipline while sharing observations with a wider audience about how such meanings shifts. The results illustrate how the students’ experience and their learning approach to design practice evolved through the introduction of tangible aesthetics.",Hall A.; Ferrarello L.; Li W.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education, E and PDE 2018",2018-01-01,Royal College of Art,Aesthetics ;  Affordances ;  Design engineering ;  Design research ;  Interdisciplinary

Societal responsibility in engineering education; a case study on RD&I-cooperation within civil engineering,"This paper describes how co-operation on Research, Development, and Innovation (RD&I) between the university and the value chain within road construction has resulted in increased awareness on the responsibility public institutions have to support industry, and at the same time attend fairness and equal treatment between industrial competitors. Universities are major contributors to societal development, through the formation of aspiring young professionals. In addition to having responsibility for equipping young professionals with knowledge and skills necessary for becoming attractive participants in working life, universities have responsibility for forming a society in responsible and ethical directions. Co-operating on RD&I with private companies might be challenging for governmental universities, as new knowledge is developed to increase the competitive advantage of the funding company only, and thus should not be distributed. The mandate of governmental universities is to develop and distribute knowledge openly. It is important to attend that any secluded industrial activities are fully funded by industry, not subsidised by the general governmental funding for the university. The case discussed in this paper concerns an RD&I cooperation between two governmental bodies; a university and a newly established road construction client organisation. Both organisations share the societal mission of supporting the industrial value chain. As a consequence of new awareness, it is realised to be important to safeguard that not only new technical knowledge is internalised in engineering education programmes and practice, however also the societal responsibility.",Thorstensen R.; Larsen I.; Svennevig P.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education, E and PDE 2018",2018-01-01,Universitetet i Agder,Industrial value chain ;  RD&I cooperation ;  Road construction ;  Societal responsibility ;  University Societal Responsibility (USR)
Pursuing diversity in engineering education; a case study on RD&I-cooperation within civil engineering,"This paper describes how cooperation on research, development and innovation (RD&I) between building-clients, industry, and the university was initiated and facilitated to develop (localised) capabilities. The initiator was the regional university; aiming both at supporting the societal development and benefiting engineering education. A year after entering the agreement, substantial measures can be traced in the engineering education: More than 150 industrial stakeholders from the constructional value chain have been participating innovation workshops at the campus. Four industry-academy advisory boards for innovation have been established, covering selected topics within the construction industry. One result is a series of capstone courses proposed not as traditionally by individual companies, but by multiple companies cooperating vertically and/or horizontally in the value chain. Seven students have already completed their master theses, and 34 students are presently working with their master or bachelor assignment within this RD&I-cooperation. An RD&I-programme (MEERC) has been launched, funding 4.1 mill USD including 6 Ph.D. scholarships. Other research and educational institutions have been invited and given substantial responsibilities in the cooperation, to secure quality in work and dialogue between related organisations supporting the industry. All universities in Norway are subject to the same rigid governmental quality assurance system. Given a variety of educational institutions distributed over a scarcely populated country, standardisation of requirements and comprehensive control systems are vital for securing quality in education. However, there is a risk that this standardisation conforms the institutions, preventing the development of diversity benefiting from localised capabilities – preventing innovation. This project demonstrates the potential for pursuing diversity under a control regime suspected to promote conformity.",Thorstensen R.; Larsen I.; Svennevig P.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education, E and PDE 2018",2018-01-01,Universitetet i Agder,Capstone courses ;  Constructional value chain ;  Localised capabilities ;  RD&I cooperation ;  Road construction
Innovations and value engineering contribute to sustainable structures,"Synopsis: The author has been involved in design of many bridges in the Czech Republic as well as in research and development of ultra-high performance fibre-reinforced concrete (UHPC) and its applications for precast members. His engineering practice confirmed that innovations and value engineering can significantly contribute to durable and sustainable structures. However, in rather traditional and conservative civil engineering profession it is not always easy to bring innovations to life. Many obstacles have to be surmounted including outdated design standards, rigid rules of clients and strict procedures for public procurement where any modifications are not welcomed. While the financial risk of innovative business is mainly on the designer and contractor, the clients have to approve technology which is not verified over a long period and which is connected with possible delays. The experience from innovative projects is shown on 3 implemented bridges as follows: ? Arch bridge over the Oparno valley ? Cable-stayed footbridge in Celakovice ? Lightweight pedestrian precast bridges Main advantages of these applications are high durability, low maintenance and reasonable life cycle cost. All applications were successfully implemented as alternative proposals in tenders within given financial limits. Finally, the innovative implementations can contribute to sustainable structures and their acceptance by both authorities and public.",Kalny M.,Conference Proceeding,"American Concrete Institute, ACI Special Publication",2018-01-01,Pontex Consulting Engineers,Bridges ;  Durability ;  Efficiency ;  Optimization ;  UHPC ;  Value engineering

Metamorphosis in political Economy: A new combination of three disparate ideas,"Innovation in theory building usually follows the prescription of “normal science” as described by Thomas Kuhn in his account on the history of theoretical physics – see Kuhn (1962). What already had been postulated by Descartes (compare Descartes, 1637) as a signum of science, namely the systematic advance towards smaller, more specialized, partial problems that are easier to solve, this procedure still prevails in the social sciences till today. Contrary to this piecemeal engineering approach, Joseph Schumpeter made the character mask of the revolutionary entrepreneur to his hero of progress – at least as far as innovation in the production of commodities is concerned (Schumpeter, 1911). Of course, history shows that both forms of innovation are alternating: If the slow advance and broadening of a prevailing mainstream gets stuck and the contradictions it produces start to accumulate quickly, then it is time for a revolution – in the material world (compare Hanappi & Wäckerle, 2016) as well as in its scientific correlate. It is time for a metamorphosis. In which direction a theoretical innovation in times of metamorphosis shall point clearly has to remain an unanswered question. The best characterization of its general methodological form still seems to be Schumpeter’s dictum. It is a new combination of (existing) elements. The existing elements typically should concern burning problems of the troubled mainstream (compare Hanappi, 2016), and the adjective “new” means that they so far are not connected to each other in the stagnating mainstream approach. The global political economy as well as its theoretical reflection in mainstream theory undoubtedly currently is in a state that calls for a revolutionary metamorphosis. This paper therefore sets out to develop a new combination of three seemingly unconnected ideas, which each address a fundamental contradiction. The first idea concerns the contradiction between the rich and the poor parts of the global economy, the second idea concerns the driving force of progress of the human species and its impediments, and the third idea concerns the contradiction between syntax and semantics of the formal representation of the first two contradictions. Contrary to papers in “normal science,” which in a conclusion propose a solution for their research question, this paper avoids to pretend a finite horizon of its arguments. As is appropriate for a proposed theoretical innovation it just offers a new open-ended contribution to the rapidly evolving discourse in the middle of metamorphosis.",Hanappi H.,Journal,Journal of Self-Governance and Management Economics,2018-01-01,Technische Universität Wien,Innovation ;  Political economy ;  Revolutionary metamorphosis ;  Science
"Onoff: Creative method integration: From physical to digital and back, in mechanical and product design learning","The principal objective of this paper is to demonstrate the capability of a smartphone being a useful learning sources tool in product design, rather than being a hindrance in class. OnOff is an interactive teaching and learning method, in our SCE program of Mechanical Engineering in Product Design (MEPD); it is a mixed creative process that combines abstract and concrete creative thinking in two levels of experience, when a smartphone becomes a 'personal workbench', together with existing experience of hands on labs, such as wood, metal, plastic, color, 3D printers, and varied machinery. OnOff method is designed to face teaching challenge with two main problems. The first, low and scattered attention: how to deal with the growing disturbance of using smartphones during class. Second, generational gap: how to bridge design teaching by X or Y Generation faculty, versus digital addiction of Z-Generation students. OnOff, this mixed of Offline and Online teaching method, is based on qualitative research of self-learning experience; it was tested on 120 undergraduate students; every student spent two academic years (four semesters), in Project Oriented Courses (Avital, Mazor, 2014), when Smartphones, some apps, and social network were always in use during class session. Our MEPD program consist three courses' categories: four practical and theoretical Creativity and Innovation courses, four POC, and three courses of Art and Design: Free conception drawing, Creative work with paper, and Design History and Philosophy lecture and roundtable discussions. The results of using this method indicates a great change (Brown, 2009) in positive mood of participants and general class atmosphere, high readiness to cooperate even with overseas teams, motivation of most individuals to search and explore in depth images and texts, better self-ideation, WhatsApp team-brainstorming, Skype presentations, and varied prototypes outcomes: preliminary, Digital, and 3D printed. Results also showed that a free use of digital screens, especially smartphone, facilitates the ideation stage, and particularly improved attention, and performance of inventive products, and creative problem solving tasks as well; when personal smartphone became ""legal"" in class, its presence became a breakthrough and creative learning tool for searching, documenting, communicating, and much more. It also facilitated students to experience cross-team projects in engineering and design with overseas institutes, which focuses on Cross-Campus and Cross-Function Learning.",Avital I.; Mazor G.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of NordDesign: Design in the Era of Digitalization, NordDesign 2018",2018-01-01,SCE - Shamoon College of Engineering;Mechanical Engineering Department,On-and-off process ;  Smartphone Addiction ;  Tangible versus intangible ;  Z- Generation students
Agile Prototyping for technical systems Towards an adaption of the Minimum Viable Product principle,"The realization of radical innovations is a crucial success factor for manufacturing companies acting in an environment of increasing market dynamics. Heterogeneous customer requirements, which are increasingly changing in shorter cycles, become a major challenge for manufacturers of technical systems. Alongside these external circumstances, functional complexity of technical systems increases, which constitutes another major challenge in product development. As an answer to similar circumstances, the software industry introduced agile development methods in the early 1990s. The iterative development of functional product increments being shippable to potential customers at the end of a development phase has helped the industry to dynamically align the product to the customers' needs and to reduce the development time significantly. In this context, the concept of Minimum Viable Product (MVP) has gained particular attention. The MVP is a product, carrying just enough functionality to satisfy customers and to gather feedback for subsequent development with the least amount of effort and time. Taking the Lean Start Up initiative into account, the idea of MVP is generalized to be applicable to any type of new business or product. However, the aspect of selling incomplete products is commonly considered to be hardly applicable to technical systems. Nevertheless, the idea of iteratively validating major concerns and risks in product development applying the least amount of time and resources is equally agreed as a necessary step to tackle the challenges described above. Based on user stories for the product to be developed, major concerns and risks are deduced to be cleared out as early as possible with impacted stakeholders. Following the Design Thinking approach, Feasibility (Can we do this?), Desirability (Do they want this?) and Viability (Should we do this?) are types of uncertainty to be reduced as far as possible with each iteration. Due to increasingly interconnected technical systems, most of these subjects are very likely to impact several non-separable functions and disciplines within the system at once. Considering this along with the inherent fact of expensive and time-consuming realization of physical prototypes, the application of the MVP principle becomes a major challenge itself. Therefore, this paper introduces a holistic framework to elaborate an appropriate methodology to support the planning and design of prototypes in agile product development of technical systems. Thereby, the methodology provides an approach to implement physical prototypes in line with the Minimum Viable Product principle. As part of the overall methodology, the paper outlines a procedure to systematically structure design variables, which are meant to be specified and validated by a prototype with respect to particular concerns and risks under investigation. Therefore, the affected functions are systematically graduated and described by generic prototype features, capturing generic design elements such as the geometrical shape, the operating principle or the performance level which enables an initial evaluation whether a feature needs to be specified and captured within the physical realization. Based on this classification, a target-oriented design of physical prototypes is facilitated. Subsequent research will focus on further validating this procedure and on detailing the overall methodology, encompassing the procedure subject to this paper.",Schuh G.; Dölle C.; Schloesser S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of NordDesign: Design in the Era of Digitalization, NordDesign 2018",2018-01-01,Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen,Agile Product Development ;  Minimum Viable Product ;  Product Design ;  Prototyping
Business games and creativity stimulus: The behavior of three different teams in the ideation process,"Creativity is considered the source of idea generation for new products and for solving problems. Due to this companies should implement actions and enable means that favor the practice, stimulation and development of people's creative potential. In recent years several business games have been developed and are used as a training and motivation tool, although few of these games explore the stimulation of their players' creativity. On the other hand, studies indicate that considering the use of a game for the purpose of generating ideas is an efficient and effective way to implement improvements and innovations in organizations. The objective of this article is to identify behavioral and attitudinal differences among participants of a business game whose aim is to stimulate the creativity of its participants. To do so, the research contemplated a literature review and a field research with experiments concerning the application of a business game. The literature review focused on the relation between business games and creativity. The experiments occurred with the applications of the STORM business game in three groups: undergraduate engineering students, undergraduate design students and professionals working in a creative industry. In order to gather information, we used: 1) observations of a control group, whose purpose was to observe the performance of the players and 2) a questionnaire to collect the opinions and impressions of the participants about the game. As a result we present that the STORM business game stimulates the creativity of its participants, with acceptance rate of 97.5% among the players, thus demonstrating that the relationship between business game and creativity is a beneficial practice. In addition, we identified that when used for idea-generating purposes the motivation and outcome of the players was positively similar, be it with engineering students or creative industry professionals. However, when used for product development the motivation of the players has declined, although the results have remained positive.",Rosa M.; Rodrigues L.; González M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of NordDesign: Design in the Era of Digitalization, NordDesign 2018",2018-01-01,Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte,Group creativity ;  Motivation ;  Organizational creativity ;  Serious game
Addressing sustainability in product requirements - A systems perspective,"Lack of sustainability considerations in product development can lead to unintended consequences that are costly in the long run, and difficult to solve. Furthermore, the sustainability performance of a solution is predominately determined by decisions in the early phases of the design process, in which requirements are formed and which plays an essential role to guide and constrain innovation. The purpose of this paper is therefore to explore possibilities to address previously identified research gaps regarding i) the importance and challenges to integrate sustainability aspects into design requirements, and ii) the need of a strategic approach based on a full socio-ecological sustainability perspective to select which sustainability criteria to integrate. The aim is to investigate how the influence of sustainability aspects on traditional design variables may be modelled using systems thinking, e.g., System Dynamics modelling, as previous research has pointed out this as an area for future research. Against this background this paper explores the potential of a systems thinking perspective within requirements development, and how it can be applied, to favour a strategic sustainability perspective in product development. A conceptual literature review covering systems engineering, requirements engineering and systems dynamics, was conducted to analyse which phase in the requirements development that could benefit from systems thinking to promote a strategic integration of sustainability criteria into the requirement list. The results point towards the domain between stakeholder requirements and functional requirements, to allow building of a shared understanding the full design decision context that can be cascaded through the requirement levels. Furthermore, a systems analysis model can clarify which requirements that are involved in trade-offs and how. In addition, more detailed requirements imply less space for innovation. One outcome of the paper is a simplified causal loop diagram, showing how a systems' modelling approach can help identify both traditional trade-offs between strategically identified leading sustainability criteria and traditional design requirements. Potential incentives for sustainable design decisions were identified. Future research will focus on improving and testing the suggested approach and investigate how sustainability criteria indicators can be linked to design value drivers.",Watz M.; Hallstedt S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of NordDesign: Design in the Era of Digitalization, NordDesign 2018",2018-01-01,Blekinge Tekniska Högskola,Causal loop diagrams ;  Product design ;  Sustainability ;  Sustainable product development ;  Systems engineering ;  Systems thinking
A model-driven decision arena: Augmenting decision making in early design,"A wide variety of expert competencies, transcending traditional disciplines, are needed to foresee and evaluate the impact of decisions in the conceptual phase of engineering design. Where this previously was a trade-off regarding design and development of the pure physical artefact it is now a complex ambiguity game involving all disciplines touching a solution during its lifecycle, due to the movement towards integrated product-service solutions. Gathering the involved, normally diverse, group of stakeholders in a collaborative setting for design exploration exercises, sharing knowledge and values, is believed to augment decision making ability in early design. A model-driven environment for collaborative decision making is proposed as a solution that potentially may help harvesting these benefits. In this environment stakeholders interact with each other using digital models, model generated information, simulation data and product data collected in the field in order to evaluate design proposals by playing out potential usage scenarios and investigating cause and effect relationships. Initial work on conceptualizing, developing, and testing such an environment is done through a pilot study based on two industrial use cases. The development process iteratively unveils demands and constraints related to the environment. These discoveries go hand in hand with developing an infrastructure regarding both hardware and software as well as required human resources in a functional environment. Fully realizing the envisioned model-driven environment for collaborative decision making entails new ways of working requiring new knowledge as well as technological innovation. In that aspect, environment infrastructure and usage are elaborated on and direction for further research and development is indicated.",Wall J.; Bertoni M.; Larsson T.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of NordDesign: Design in the Era of Digitalization, NordDesign 2018",2018-01-01,Blekinge Tekniska Högskola,Conceptual design ;  Decision making ;  Design exploration ;  Digitalisation ;  Model-driven design ;  Multi-stakeholder ;  Visualization
Infrastructure as a Complex Adaptive System,"National infrastructure systems spanning energy, transport, digital, waste, and water are well recognised as complex and interdependent. While some policy makers have been keen to adopt the narrative of complexity, the application of complexity-based methods in public policy decision-making has been restricted by the lack of innovation in associated methodologies and tools. In this paper we firstly evaluate the application of complex adaptive systems theory to infrastructure systems, comparing and contrasting this approach with traditional systems theory. We secondly identify five key theoretical properties of complex adaptive systems including adaptive agents, diverse agents, dynamics, irreversibility, and emergence, which are exhibited across three hierarchical levels ranging from agents, to networks, to systems. With these properties in mind, we then present a case study on the development of a system-of-systems modelling approach based on complex adaptive systems theory capable of modelling an emergent national infrastructure system, driven by agent-level decisions with explicitly modelled interdependencies between energy, transport, digital, waste, and water. Indeed, the novel contribution of the paper is the articulation of the case study describing a decade of research which applies complex adaptive systems properties to the development of a national infrastructure system-of-systems model. This approach has been used by the UK National Infrastructure Commission to produce a National Infrastructure Assessment which is capable of coordinating infrastructure policy across a historically fragmented governance landscape spanning eight government departments. The application will continue to be pertinent moving forward due to the continuing complexity of interdependent infrastructure systems, particularly the challenges of increased electrification and the proliferation of the Internet of Things.",Oughton E.; Usher W.; Tyler P.; Hall J.,Journal,Complexity,2018-01-01,University of Cambridge;University of Oxford,
Current status of development and intellectual properties of biomimetic medical materials,"Biomimetic medical materials are the biomaterials which mimic the important characteristic features of natural material/tissue structures or architectures and are mainly used in biomedical field for their applications in tissue regeneration, medical devices, biosensors and drug delivery. It is one of the leading research topics which have the ability to replace the existing biomaterials and medical devices and to development new biomaterials. The innovation and development in this research area are growing quickly because of the state-of-the-art techniques like nanobiotechnology, biosensors, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, and 3D (bio)printing. These techniques can mimic the biomacromolecules, peptide sequences, morphology, chemical and physical structures more precisely than other currently available methods. The importance of hydrogels and its composites as examples among many other biomaterials are increasing vastly because of their recent advancements in its biological, chemical and physical cues which are biomimetic to native tissues. Furthermore, an enhancement in the 3D bioprinting technology where live cells are printed along with biomaterials demonstrates the capabilities of this technology to innovate novel tissue engineering products in micro- to macro-technology. The recent trends of development and intellectual properties related to biomimetic medical materials along with their perspectives and area of scope are discussed by focusing on 3D bioprinting in this chapter.",Gopinathan J.; Noh I.,Book Series,Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology,2018-01-01,Seoul National University of Science and Technology,3D bioprinting ;  Biomimetic ;  Hydrogels ;  Intellectual property ;  Tissue engineering

Automatic control in support of modular innovation,"The modular innovation is the practical side, the form and method of the implementation so called responsible innovation. The implementation of responsible innovation goes on two interconnected like a genetic spiral, streamlines: transformative research driven innovation and modular innovation. While modular innovation is the practical side, the transformative research driven innovation is the strategic, ethical, political and planning side of responsible innovation. In this study we will introduce the basic nature of modular innovation and the role, the theoretical and methodological background of the usage of automatic control in support of this type of innovation. The paper concludes by presenting some recent research tasks in automatic control of the large scale distributed systems and identifies important research directions for further development of the automatic control.",Nagy K.; Hajrizi E.,Conference Proceeding,IFAC-PapersOnLine,2018-01-01,UBT - Higher Education Institution,automatic control ;  modular innovation ;  responsible innovation ;  transformative research ;  transformative research driven innovation
Confidently exploring the solution space: The within-subject effects of product dissection on design variety and creative self-efficacy,"Product dissection is a popular educational tool in engineering design due to its ability to help students understand the components and sub-components of a product, provide inspiration for new design ideas, and aid in product redesign. While prior research has investigated how dissecting a product before idea generation impacts the creative output of the ideation session, these studies failed to look at the types of ideas generated before dissection or how the type of product dissected impacts this. In addition, few studies have looked at how creative self-efficacy (CSE), or one’s belief in their creative ability, is influenced by these intervention activities. Thus, the current study was developed to respond to these research voids through an exploratory study with engineering design students. The results of the study suggest that virtual dissection helps students generate a larger variety of ideas after the activity at the physical principle, working principle, and embodiment levels, and that the complexity of the dissected product impacts variation at the embodiment level. In addition, CSE was not affected by the dissection activity. These results strongly support the utilization and implementation of dissection practices in engineering education as a means for aiding students in the expansion of the solution space in the early stages of design. They also bring attention to the need to explore the exact cause-effect relationship between innovation interventions and student confidence gains in their creative abilities.",Starkey E.; Alzayed M.; Hunter S.; Miller S.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference,2018-01-01,Penn State College of Engineering;Pennsylvania State University,Creativity ;  Design education ;  Design variety ;  Idea generation ;  Product dissection
Adapting the fbs model of designing for usage-driven innovation processes,"There has been rising interest in confronting formal models of design with practical design methods, in order to understand better both and to explore how they can improve each other. In this article, we try to map the Radical Innovation Design (RID) methodology in Gero's Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) framework. We encounter difficulties in doing so, and propose new constructs extending the FBS framework to account for some processes in RID. For instance, FBS is extended to describe the early stages of RID, where usages are analyzed to identify the appropriate situations and problems on which to innovate. We present a short practical case study to illustrate the relevance of these concepts. Our findings join those of others who have investigated the use of FBS to illustrate innovative projects, where requirements are unclear. We propose perspectives for future research, notably pursuing this work with the situated FBS framework.",Yannou B.; Cluzel F.; Lamé G.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference,2018-01-01,The Healthcare Improvement Studies Institute;Université Paris-Saclay,
Estimation of the marketing potential of industrial enterprises in the period of re-engineering of business processes,"Activity of business entities requires a constant increase in the level of their economic potential and the level of competitiveness of the products on the market. This task can be fulfilled provided the concept of constant economic growth is formed in the activity of enterprises, which can be implemented through the management of changes in the economic activity of enterprises. One of the components is the marketing activity, which plays one of the leading roles in shaping the sustainable development of an industrial enterprise when carrying out transformational changes in its activity. These changes, which are the re-engineering of business processes, help the company management adapt to the changing market (marketing) environment and optimize the internal business processes. The relevance of the research is undeniable. The article presents the main directions of transition to the effective marketing activity in the period of re-engineering of industrial enterprises' business processes based on the analysis of the main trends of marketing and innovation activities of economic entities from different countries. The authors developed the indices that characterize the marketing potential of the company during the business processes' re-engineering. They proposed to use an integral index of the company's marketing potential during radical transformations and to take effective management decisions based on the prevailing range of its criteria values when carrying out an economic estimation of the company's marketing potential in the period of business processes' re-engineering. The results obtained from the calculations demonstrate the final estimation of the industrial enterprise's marketing potential during the business processes' re-engineering, which allows the top management of the industrial company to determine the level of performance of the company marketing activity and make sound managerial decisions for its further development.",Taraniuk L.; Kobyzskyi D.; Thomson M.,Journal,Problems and Perspectives in Management,2018-01-01,Sumy State University;ESEI International Business School Barcelona,Analysis ;  Business entity ;  Marketing activity ;  Method ;  Radical transformations
"A call to (green) arms: A rallying cry for green chemistry and engineering for CO<inf>2</inf> capture, utilisation and storage","Chemists, engineers, scientists, lend us your ears... Carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) is among the largest challenges on the horizon and we need your help. In this perspective, we focus on identifying the critical research needs to make CCUS a reality, with an emphasis on how the principles of green chemistry (GC) and green engineering can be used to help address this challenge. We identify areas where GC principles can readily improve the energy or atom efficiency of processes or reduce the environmental impact. Conversely, we also identify dilemmas where the research needs may be at odds with GC principles, and present potential paths forward to minimise the environmental impacts of chemicals and processes needed for CCUS. We also walk a different path from conventional perspectives in that we postulate and introduce potential innovative research directions and concepts (some not yet experimentally validated) in order to foster innovation, or at least stoke conversation and question why certain approaches have not yet been attempted. With elements of historical context, technological innovation, critical thinking, and some humour, we issue a call to arms and hope you may join us in this fight.",Leclaire J.; Heldebrant D.,Journal,Green Chemistry,2018-01-01,Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1;Pacific Northwest National Laboratory,
Webtool for the analysis and visualization of the evolution of wiki online communities,"Commons-based peer production is a mode of social innovation where communities co-create openly-accessible resources exploiting the network effect of the Internet. Traditionally, research has focused on the successful cases of FLOSS and Wikipedia, whereas other communities such as wikis have not been studied sufficiently in-depth. Moreover, there is a clear lack of analytical tools to facilitate their study. In this paper, we describe WikiChron, a new web-tool for the analysis and visualization of the evolution of wiki online communities. Such tool will facilitate the generation and validation of hypotheses around multiple research questions, for example, those around curves of growth or those about factors of rise and decline of wikis . This work presents two case studies: the analysis of growth curves in similar wikis, and the different evolution of coordination and communication in wiki projects.

"A methodology to integrate regulatory expertise, research and education to accelerate biomedical device translation","The aging population, new healthcare needs, and people living longer are driving an unmet clinical need for biomedical research and development of innovative medical devices. Academic research and development is a key component of biomedical R&D. Academic scientists and engineers have considerable ability to contribute to addressing the unmet clinical need. However, turning basic research into clinical interventions, such as medical devices, that improve the health of individuals, is exceptionally difficult. Device development and/or use of these devices in human clinical studies, even if for early feasibility studies, is highly regulated, requiring a unique knowledge base that is often lacking in academia. For successful regulated device development, and subsequent regulatory approval, researchers need access to tools, expertise and resources that can help simplify and accelerate an often complex and lengthy regulatory pathway while providing for patient safety and regulatory compliance. Therefore it is necessary to integrate the use of regulatory and quality consulting and expertise into the translational process for taking scientific research into clinical research into usable innovation. Bringing together this type of synergistic relationship to advance research offers value to the researcher, the regulatory consultant, the students, and the patient population for which the technology was developed or will be used. This paper will discuss a model for an integrated biotechnology focused clinical research translational center that integrates research, regulatory, compliance, quality, and academics.",Easton D.,Conference Proceeding,"IMSCI 2018 - 12th International Multi-Conference on Society, Cybernetics and Informatics, Proceedings",2018-01-01,Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science,Engineering ;  Higher education ;  Medical device ;  Regulatory ;  Translation
"Foreseen capabilities, bottlenecks identification and potential limitations of serpent mc transport code in large-scale full 3-D burnup calculations","Continuous improvement in Nuclear Industry Safety Standards and reactor designer’s and operator’s commercial goals lead to an increasing demand of fast running and highly accurate methodologies oriented to improve the prediction capabilities of main reactor’s parameters under steady state and transient situations. An increasing effort has been observed during past years to develop high accurate multi-physics approach for nuclear reactor analysis, based both on the availability of advanced codes and the constant increase of computational resources with massive parallel architectures. As a result, several improvements have been observed in the implementation of coupled full 3-D Monte Carlo (MC) neutronic models for nuclear reactor cores, including not only the coupling to thermal-hydraulics but also fuel behavior codes. This approach has proved at concept level to be able to develop high accurate models that would allow to predict important safety and performance parameters of nuclear reactors with less conservativism. Under this framework, the European Research and innovation project McSAFE is a coordinated effort started in September 2017 with the objective of moving MC stand-alone and coupled solution methodologies to become valuable tools for core design, safety analysis and industry like applications for LWRs of gen II and III. In this work the Serpent 2 code, a high performance MC code developed by VTT, is used by the aim of performing the preliminary screening of capabilities, performance and limitations of such challenging objective. As a result, simplified analysis are developed to identify full 3-D modeling computational requirements for typical LWR configurations, including burnup aspects.

A paradigm-shift in aerospace vehicle design synthesis and technology forecasting,"Classically, aerospace design synthesis methodologies have been developed for a specified problem, with limited or no adaptability and expandability for application to a new problem not considered in the original development. This inability eventually limits the application of a conventional ASDS towards exploration of novel concepts. Thus, the institutions using their proprietary legacy ASDS systems become confined within the product and technology range which is imposed by their system’s limitations. Such a scenario presents a grave situation as it hinders innovation and exploration at the conceptual stage, the design phase where design freedom is maximum. In response to this need, a new modular system is being developed, tested, and applied at the Aerospace Vehicle Design (AVD) Laboratory at the University of Texas at Arlington. The system, called as the Aerospace Vehicle Design Database Management System (AVD-DBMS, or simply the DBMS), provides a unique capability of developing custom-tailored sizing codes specific to the problem at hand. In this regard, the DBMS is not a synthesis system by itself. Rather, it is a system that creates custom problem-specific synthesis architectures tailor made to address the needs of the user. Such a capability represents a paradigm-shift in the way conceptual design has been traditionally implemented. This paper presents an overview of the research effort of six researchers over a span of eight years. The primary focus of this paper is to provide the conceptual solution logic, the development process and system specification of the DBMS. Additionally, four distinct case-studies are presented that demonstrate DBMS’ superior capability to explore novel design concepts and provide the decision maker with informed and smart decision-making support.",Rana L.; McCall T.; Haley J.; Gonzalez L.; Omoragbon A.; Oza A.; Chudoba B.,Conference Proceeding,2018 AIAA SPACE and Astronautics Forum and Exposition,2018-01-01,The University of Texas at Arlington,
The history and horizons of microscale neural interfaces,"Microscale neural technologies interface with the nervous system to record and stimulate brain tissue with high spatial and temporal resolution. These devices are being developed to understand the mechanisms that govern brain function, plasticity and cognitive learning, treat neurological diseases, or monitor and restore functions over the lifetime of the patient. Despite decades of use in basic research over days to months, and the growing prevalence of neuromodulation therapies, in many cases the lack of knowledge regarding the fundamental mechanisms driving activation has dramatically limited our ability to interpret data or fine-tune design parameters to improve long-term performance. While advances in materials, microfabrication techniques, packaging, and understanding of the nervous system has enabled tremendous innovation in the field of neural engineering, many challenges and opportunities remain at the frontiers of the neural interface in terms of both neurobiology and engineering. In this short-communication, we explore critical needs in the neural engineering field to overcome these challenges. Disentangling the complexities involved in the chronic neural interface problem requires simultaneous proficiency in multiple scientific and engineering disciplines.

Business modeling and flexibility in software-intensive product development - A systematic literature review,"Continuously achieving and maintaining competitive advantage is the critical survival factor for software-intensive product development companies undergoing digitalization transformation. These companies remain uncertain if investments in business modeling is sufficient to cope with rapidly changing business models, technology, and customer demands. We conducted a Systematic Literature Review using the snowballing methodology to explore the effects of business modeling on business flexibility and variability in the realization. Our results confirm a research gap regarding translating desired strategic flexibility into business options that can efficiently and effectively be implemented using software-based variability in the realization. We conclude that more research is needed consolidating business model innovation, experimentation, and operationalization. Building on theories for learning and knowledge creation, we propose a framework for describing change and analyzing strategic, tactical and operational choices in business model experimentation.",Wilson M.; Wnuk K.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2018-01-01,Blekinge Tekniska Högskola;Ericsson Sweden,

Pipeline and cable stability: Updated state of the art,"At OMAE in 2008 the 'state of the art' in pipeline on-bottom stability engineering was summarized, providing an overview of the current available knowledge for addressing pipeline stability. The aim of that work was to summarise key aspects of the pipeline stability design process and to include some historical perspective. The paper discusses the advantage and shortfalls of the different design approaches with a view to consolidate understanding, rather than to provide a ready-made solution to a complex design problem [1]. Since that time, a decade of research and further methodology refinement has extended the boundaries of the industry's knowledge and understanding of the behaviour of subsea pipelines and cables, including geotechnics, hydrodynamics, oceanography and structural response modelling. In particular, progress has been made in: • The response of pipelines to sediment transport and scour; • Understanding the behaviour of small diameter pipelines and cables within wave and current boundary layers; and • The behaviour of cables on rocky seabeds in high energy marine environments. This paper summarises these innovations to enable the application of new paradigms in engineering practice and improved outcomes for initial project capital cost, reliability and operational integrity, as well as better models to predict the longterm behaviour where pipes are decommissioned in-situ. While a relatively widely studied field of engineering, there remain areas of active ongoing research to improve our understanding and ability to model and predict subsea pipeline on-bottom behavior, with a summary of the anticipated future opportunities proposed.",Griffiths T.; Draper S.; White D.; Cheng L.; An H.; Tong F.; Fogliani A.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering - OMAE,2018-01-01,The University of Western Australia;University of Southampton,
Simulator for arctic marine structures (SAMS),"As offshore activities in the Arctic constitute a relatively new field with only a handful of relevant operations to draw experience from, and since full-scale trials are extremely expensive, there is an expressed need for much more extensive, detailed and cost-efficient analysis of concepts based on numerical simulations. However, until recently simulation tools of sufficient quality to perform such numerical analysis have not existed. The only verification available has been through a limited set of experiments in ice model basins. Today, this has changed, partly through the efforts at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) hosting SAMCoT (Centre for Research-based Innovation - Sustainable Arctic Marine and Coastal Technology), laying the foundation of a versatile and highly accurate high-fidelity numerical simulator for offshore structures in various ice conditions such as level ice, broken ice and ice ridges. Arctic Integrated Solutions AS (ArcISo) is a spin-off company from NTNU established in 2016 with the vision of increasing the technology readiness level of SAMCoT's numerical models to become a professional software package for the analysis of sea ice actions and action effects on Arctic offshore and coastal structures. This software package is called Simulator for Arctic Marine Structures (SAMS) and it was first released in 2017. This paper introduces the software implementation and the theoretical basis of SAMS, and it discusses the use of full-scale data to validate the simulator.",Lubbad R.; Løset S.; Lu W.; Tsarau A.; Van Den Berg M.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering - OMAE,2018-01-01,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet;Arctic Integrated Solutions AS (ArcISo),
Transformative demands for ERP functionalities: Knowledge management in customized manufacturing,"Customized manufacturing requires completely new technological solutions and long and careful prototype development and testing. The new requirements increase production costs, extend manufacturing time and entail frequent errors in the product quality. So far, knowledge management framework provided by ERP systems still has not responded to the customized needs even though ERP's provide plenty of innovation solutions for prognosis, trending, etc. Additionally, high uncertainty of customization could be managed better by employing diverse expertise of employees if their knowledge could be empowered together with rigid knowledge about the customized order. The goal of this paper is to determine customized manufacturing demands for functionalities of knowledge management systems that can be incorporated in ERP. The research is based on a case study conducted in an SME type company settled in Lithuania. Extended interviews on different issues, including the decision making system, problem solving, strategic decisions and ERP implementation and use, have been conducted during the last 2 years (from June, 2016 to March, 2018) with company leaders, managers, constructers and production workers. Although, one may expect to accrue experience and improve abilities with every new order, the company is still facing difficulties in coping with uncertainties of incoming orders even after ERP was implemented and launched. In conclusions, customized manufacturing is intensively looking for new knowledge management solutions that meet strictly defined requirements with new ERP functionalities that could be explicit as system based on employee participation and machine learning. The main functionalities could be listed as following: 1.) to make prognostic price estimations for customized and unique orders; 2.) to classify new orders specifying what additional capacities are require to develop the product; 3.) to recognize and accumulate any data that can be stored in the system for future solutions; 4.) to provide guidelines for knowledge management at all stages of knowledge acquisition, transformation and application.",Mikulskiene B.; Pitrenaite B.; Galiauskiene E.; Tolocka E.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Knowledge Management, ECKM",2018-01-01,Mykolas Romeris University,Functionalities ;  Knowledge management ;  Machine learning
Modelling results with a new simulator for arctic marine structures - SAMS,"The Simulator for Arctic Marine Structures (SAMS) has emerged on the foundation of a number of scientific models developed at SAMCoT - Centre for Research-based Innovation - Sustainable Arctic Marine and Coastal Technology hosted by NTNU - as a versatile numerical tool for the analysis of sea ice actions and action effects on Arctic offshore structures. The current capabilities of SAMS allow engineers to analyse icefloe impacts and ice loads on arbitrary marine structures in various environmental conditions; simulations may involve both fixed and floating structures, non-rigid multi floe interactions, ice breaking and ice rubbling, wind, current and propeller-flow effects on both structures and ice. All these capabilities can be combined to model also complex marine operations in the Arctic and subarctic regions. As SAMS can be applied in both full- and model scales, a number of available experimental case studies from the field and ice tanks can be reanalysed with the new simulator to ensure the high fidelity of the simulations and to establish a validation basis. This paper presents several of such case studies and discusses further validation possibilities.",Tsarau A.; Van Den Berg M.; Lu W.; Lubbad R.; Løset S.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering - OMAE,2018-01-01,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet;Arctic Integrated Solutions AS (ArcISo),
Towards a framework for managing knowledge integration in university-industry collaboration projects,"Previous studies have called for more research on knowledge management in collaborative projects between university and industry. The scientific community urges the development of managerial mechanisms that will stimulate innovation outcomes and make government-funded projects to generate more long-term value for the society. This study is intended to contribute to close this gap through development of a practical framework for management of university-industry collaboration with knowledge transformation in focus. It concentrates on how to manage the innovation process by leveraging creation, accumulation, dissemination, application, storing, and retrieving of knowledge in university-industry innovation projects. The context for this investigation was a Norwegian region with a local university campus and local maritime/marine companies, mostly concerned with mechanical engineering. Ten in-depth interviews with CEO’s, project managers and researches experienced in such projects were undertaken. The questions covered different topics, including project strategy, objectives, facilitation and accumulation of knowledge. The study reviewed knowledge management models in the literature, and found Wallin and Von Krogh’s five-step model for the integration of knowledge in open innovation setting suitable for the university-industry context chosen. The results propose a conceptual process model of knowledge management in university-industry innovation projects, which addresses the initiation of specific strategic efforts on organisational, collaborative and project levels. These efforts are intended to ensure the partners’ commitment to the project, which in turn enables and leverages knowledge co-creation and exploitation. The findings provide the potential to contribute to more effective and efficient management of the innovation processes between industry and university and reinforce a knowledge-based society. The sample size will be extended be more interviews to extend the data basis in the future.",Hansen I.; Mork O.; Welo T.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Knowledge Management, ECKM",2018-01-01,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Innovation ;  Knowledge management ;  University-industry collaboration
Is Portuguese higher education developing students capacities for innovation? The truth behind learning outcomes,"The political and social discourse about innovation becomes dominant in our economy and society, which impacts also on educational and labour market systems. Particularly for Higher Education, boosting knowledge and innovation appears as a strategic mission, calling for innovative research, innovative pedagogies, and innovative organizational structures. Similarly, fostering students' abilities to innovate appears as a vector of this strategic mission. Based on this framework, this study intends to explore if, effectively, innovation (or the capacity to innovate) appears as an expected learning outcome to the achieved by students at the end of their qualification. Using a qualitative approach, the contend of learning outcomes proposed in all programs submitted to quality accreditation in Portugal (since 2009) was analyzed. In general, results indicate that innovation is fairly mentioned (about 35,8% of the programs mentioned it at least once). From a total of 39742 segments coded, innovation is mentioned 1704 times, which correspond to 4,3%. A cross comparison between academic degrees revealed that innovation is particularly relevant for PhD degrees and integrated masters. Significant differences are found according to disciplinary areas. Environmental sciences, art and design programs, engineering and computer sciences clearly emphasize innovation as an expected skill to be achieved by their students. Some implications to practice need to be debated, confronting these results with literature insights.",Dias D.; Soares D.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE",2018-01-01,Universidade Europeia,Competences ;  Higher education ;  Innovation ;  Learning outcomes
Research on the impact of new green building materials on project cost management,"With the continuous progress of economic development and the continuous improvement of the people's living standards, the demands of the masses of the people are becoming higher and higher, and the construction industry has welcomed the important opportunities for development. It should be noted that the new building materials not only effectively improve the construction quality of the construction project, but also have a significant impact on the cost management of the construction project. The continuous development of economy has promoted the continuous innovation of engineering materials in China's construction industry. This trend has brought new construction materials. The emergence of new materials will inevitably bring about certain impact on the cost of construction projects. No matter from the total budget of the project cost or the budget method of the project cost, it is a completely new adjustment.",Wan K.,Trade Journal,Paper Asia,2018-01-01,Shandong Jianzhu University,Construction cost ;  Construction engineering ;  New material
Dynamic modeling of H-type floating VAWT considering the rigid - Flexible coupling motions,"Dynamical characteristics of the H-type floating VAWT (vertical axis wind turbine) were studied. The wind turbine blades and the tower were treated as flexible bodies, and the floating foundation was treated as the rigid body. Considering the nonlinear deformations of the flexible bodies, the Lagrangian equation was used to establish the dynamic equations of wind turbine system. The loads included the wave forces, the wind loads, the mooring forces and the damping forces of the wind turbine system. A numerical calculation code was developed and verified. The innovation of the code is the coupling of rigid-flexible-aerodynamic-hydrodynamic of the floating wind turbine system. Taking the 5MW wind turbine as an example, the directions of the wind and the wave were considered as the same. Then the dynamic responses of the floating foundation, the tower and the blades were calculated. The results show that the wave frequency is the main frequency component of the responses of pitch, heave and surge of the floating foundation. 2P frequency (P is the rotational frequency of the wind turbine) accounts for a higher proportion for the sway, roll and yaw of the floating foundation. 2P and 4P are the main frequency components of the tower motions. 1P is the main frequency component of the blades' motions. The 2nd mode of the blades and tower are considered. In the following research, the higher modes should be considered to improve the calculation accuracy. Besides, the model test is needed to verify the model further in the subsequent work.",Deng W.; Gao X.; Liu L.; Zhao H.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering - OMAE,2018-01-01,Tianjin University,Dynamic equations ;  H-type floating wind turbine ;  Response ;  Rigid-flexible coupling

Capturing of entrepreneurial opportunities deriving from crowdsourcing practices and additive manufacturing technologies,"Our research explore entrepreneurs' willingness and readiness to utilize advancements in additive manufacturing/prototyping technologies (AT) in combination with managerial advancements in crowdsourcing practices for the purpose to extend application of agile management practices in their business processes. Growing number of online market places like Amazon Mechanical Turk, CloudFactory, Odesk, InnoCentive, Treadless, etc. allow entrepreneurs to apply crowdsourcing management practices for more and more type of tasks leading to a more like market type of a firm that contract services and production by on-line calls to crowd-labor communities. This strategy of business processes arrangement gives entrepreneurs more flexibility and improves implementation of agile and lean startup management approaches. At the same time development of technologies for additive manufacturing/prototyping makes agile project management methodologies more relevant for ""hard"" engineering projects and manufacturing beyond just design input/requirements and development planning. Both crowdsourcing managerial technologies and additive technologies are developing steadily from small scale (laboratory) emerging ones to those that already effect and will radically affect business practices in multiple industries. Combination of rapid developments in these fields, uncertainties related sometimes even to hypes boosted by media around these technologies, lack of application statistics, and promises of these technologies to improve agile and lean management practices create an interesting mix for researchers in entrepreneurial management. In the research through interviews and questionnaires we explore how currently entrepreneurs and business men/women perceive utilization of these managerial and technical innovations for their business development strategies, how discrepancies in perception of these technologies and these technologies capabilities generate entrepreneurial opportunities. The research results are done for Eurasian Customs Union region so far. They show steadily growing communities that possess additive technology equipment and master its utilization. This is regarded as strong basis for development of online market places (IT platforms for crowdsourcing of additive technology product/services). At the same time research results show barriers for these technologies application in business practices.

Enterprise Design-A practice-driven response for generating and implementing business models Report of the Forum session at EEWC-2018,"The increasing volatility and complexity of business models call for a fast and yet robust approach to continuous transformation. Enterprise Design is an emerging and practice-driven response for gen-erating and implementing business models, while integrating innovative and disruptive Information Technology. At a limited scale, practical ex-perience has been gained in several industry environments. To establish a research program to further enhance, develop and mature Enterprise Design, a 1/2 day Industry-meets-Academia forum on Enterprise Design was conducted, exploring the strengths and weaknesses of this approach, and seeking for opportunities for further research collaboration with in-dustrial relevance. It appeared to be crucial to further increase the speed and robustness of transformation by a gradual expansion of the meta-model of the ED approach, continuously applied on real-life cases (e.g. supported by low-code platforms). Also of major relevance is the creation of a governance model for Enterprise Design that is able to handle inter-ventions in the context of disruptive innovations; also these governance models should be applied and monitored in real-life cases to establish best-practices in timings, iterations, order of working and the relation-ship with achieved benefits.",Land M.; Van Der Zanden H.; Kruidhof O.,Conference Proceeding,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2018-01-01,Antwerp Management School;Shell Global;Capgemini Nederland B.V.;European Agency,Agile ;  DEMO ;  Enterprise Design ;  Enterprise Engineering ;  Organization Implementation

Research and education in computational science and engineering,"This report presents challenges, opportunities, and directions for computational science and engineering (CSE) research and education for the next decade. Over the past two decades the field of CSE has penetrated both basic and applied research in academia, industry, and laboratories to advance discovery, optimize systems, support decision-makers, and educate the scientific and engineering workforce. Informed by centuries of theory and experiment, CSE performs computational experiments to answer questions that neither theory nor experiment alone is equipped to answer. CSE provides scientists and engineers with algorithmic inventions and software systems that transcend disciplines and scales. CSE brings the power of parallelism to bear on troves of data. Mathematics-based advanced computing has become a prevalent means of discovery and innovation in essentially all areas of science, engineering, technology, and society, and the CSE community is at the core of this transformation. However, a combination of disruptive developments-including the architectural complexity of extreme-scale computing, the data revolution and increased attention to data-driven discovery, and the specialization required to follow the applications to new frontiers---is redefining the scope and reach of the CSE endeavor. With these many current and expanding opportunities for the CSE field, there is a growing demand for CSE graduates and a need to expand CSE educational offerings. This need includes CSE programs at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, as well as continuing education and professional development programs, exploiting the synergy between computational science and data science. Yet, as institutions consider new and evolving educational programs, it is essential to consider the broader research challenges and opportunities that provide the context for CSE education and workforce development.",Rüde U.; Willcox K.; McInnes L.; De Sterck H.,Journal,SIAM Review,2018-01-01,MIT School of Engineering;Argonne National Laboratory;Monash University;Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg,Computational science and engineering ;  Education ;  High-performance computing ;  Large data analytics ;  Predictive science

Assessing the impact of hybrid distributed electric propulsion on VTOL aircraft design & system effectiveness,"Current VTOL aircraft design processes require significant changes in computational methodologies resulting from innovations in distributed hybrid and electric propulsion technology. Electric VTOL (eVTOL) aircraft design offers radically different configurations by eliminating limitations in weight, size and location of Internal Combustion Engines (ICE) and associated fuel systems. Hybrid Distributed Electric Propulsion (HDEP) solutions, to include eVTOL, allow designers to incorporate a greater number of smaller, lightweight propulsors throughout the airframe structure as necessary to meet complex mission requirements. Additional benefits of HDEP versus fossil fuel counterparts, include reduced acoustic and thermal signatures and lighter and smaller structures. Because of the many advantages of DEP, it is quickly becoming the preferred choice for autonomous aircraft design. This paper addresses the necessary changes to VTOL Synthesis to include DEP and Autonomy for HDEP aircraft. Two of the authors, Dr. Daniel P.

A solution in search of a problem: A method for the development of blockchain use cases,"Blockchain technology is a very recent and fast evolving phenomenon with the potential to disrupt various industries. Organizations are thus increasingly looking at blockchain technology and are forming multifunctional teams to evaluate the technology and its impact on their businesses. Researchers and practitioners, however, still lack a technology-driven, systematic approach to understand the potential of blockchain and to develop convincing use cases. We addressed this research gap by applying an action design research approach and situational method engineering to propose a method for the development of blockchain use cases. Following this approach, we iteratively evaluated and further developed the proposed method through application and testing in four distinct industries. We thus derive constructive knowledge at the cutting edge of digital transformation, innovation management, and utilization of emerging technologies. In addition, our research supports practitioners in systematically developing blockchain use cases.",Fridgen G.; Lockl J.; Radszuwill S.; Rieger A.; Schweizer A.; Urbach N.,Conference Proceeding,"Americas Conference on Information Systems 2018: Digital Disruption, AMCIS 2018",2018-01-01,FIM Research Center,Action design research ;  Blockchain ;  Emerging technology ;  Situational method engineering ;  Use case development
Requirements for Representing Data-Driven Business Models - Towards Extending the Business Model Canvas,"Business modeling has become an essential tool in practice for analyzing and generating business models. In recent years, digital innovation with data-driven services gained an important role for the development of new or improved business models. As a consequence of this development, the impact of data on business models in general and business modeling in particular becomes an important issue in research as well as practice. Yet, research on business modeling for data-driven business models (DDBM) is a burgeoning field of research. Hence, this paper surveys the extant literature of DDBM to assess the state of the art in this area. Based on these insights, the paper suggests requirements of DDBM and opportunities for future business modeling research that could improve the analysis and generation of DDBM. As a consequence of these requirements, we suggest opportunities to extend the Business Model Canvas for data-driven business models.",Kühne B.; Böhmann T.,Conference Proceeding,"Americas Conference on Information Systems 2018: Digital Disruption, AMCIS 2018",2018-01-01,Universität Hamburg,Business model representation ;  Data-driven service ;  Digitalization
Theories for analysing innovation and technology in emerging financial markets: The case of algorithmic and high frequency trading,"Theoretical and empirical analysis of complex innovation and technology from a multi-disciplinary perspective is often recommended, yet rarely undertaken in management and information systems scholarship. This paper examines high frequency trading as an innovation in financial markets enabled by sophisticated computer technology. Primary data from the US and UK is combined with secondary sources from academic studies, government agencies, financial institutions and the media on the ideologies and practices governing high frequency trading. Theoretical perspectives of rational choice theory, bounded rationality, social constructionism and Marxism are rooted in different ontological and empirical positions. Each theory prioritises distinct levels and units of analysis for HFT which, by extension, shape the research agendas for examining the regulatory processes, market structures, firm strategies and technologies of the HFT phenomenon.",Currie W.; Seddon J.; Cooper R.; Van Vliet B.,Conference Proceeding,"Americas Conference on Information Systems 2018: Digital Disruption, AMCIS 2018",2018-01-01,Audencia;Illinois Institute of Technology,Financial markets ;  High frequency trading ;  Innovation ;  Regulation ;  Technology
The inspirational value of unintentional design occurrences: Freeing aesthetic,"The paper stresses the importance of taking into consideration those unintentional design occurrences that leave imprints on the object-oriented dimension of the environment. The visual traces registered on surfaces, represent a trigger for creativity. The information captured undergoes a metamorphosis in the perception of the viewer who intuitively puts it to use. The value of these unintended occurrences is given by the incipient quality of further becoming. To this, the perceiver assigns potential renditions in terms of aesthetics or functionality. The unintended occurrences, as mediums for innovation acquires inspirational value. The environment and personal space are open fields of research and a metaphorical bank of data cumulating information on human behaviour and the results of human-object, inter-objectual or object-environment interactions. The paper aims at stressing the importance of decoding visual markers to benefit creativity and aesthetics.",Vuscan I.; Feng S.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2018-01-01,China University of Petroleum (East China),
"Smart systems everywhere - Intelligence, autonomy, technology and society","Smart Anything Everywhere - that's the new hype on IoT, Internet of Things, combined with Intelligence, Autonomy and Connectivity. IoT is the infrastructure, Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are the basis of components and “Things” - may they be visible or integrated into every day devices. Comfort, health, services of all kinds, safety, security and privacy of people depend increasingly on these. The challenges have been e.g. taken up by AIOTI, the Alliance for Internet of Things Innovation, or ARTEMIS, EPoSS and AENEAS, the three industrial associations in the ECSEL Joint Undertaking, with an industry-oriented European Research Program, and many national programs, e.g. by BMVIT (Austrian Ministry of Transport, Innovation and Technology). Highly automated or autonomous smart interacting systems are becoming the main drivers for innovations and efficient services. The impact on society and economy is tremendous and will change our way of living and economy in a disruptive manner, and we will face not only benefits but also new hazards and risks. Dependability (safety, reliability, availability, security, maintainability, resilience, etc.) in a holistic sense becomes an important issue. Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Big Data and open, adaptive systems in a rather unpredictable environment are key challenges for systems of systems. The paper will try to provide an overview not primarily on technological but also on some economic, societal and ethical aspects of highly automated and autonomous system in a changing world, hopefully better than the “Brave New World” of Aldous Huxley or “1984”.",Schoitsch E.,Conference Proceeding,"IDIMT 2018: Strategic Modeling in Management, Economy and Society - 26th Interdisciplinary Information Management Talks",2018-01-01,Austrian Institute of Technology,Autonomous Systems ;  Cyber-physical Systems ;  Embedded Intelligence ;  Ethical aspects ;  Internet of Things (IoT) ;  Legal aspects ;  Liability ;  Safety ;  Security ;  Smart Systems ;  Societal impact ;  Systems-of-Systems
Prevention of Potential Hazards Associated with Marine Gas Hydrate Exploitation: A Review,"Marine gas hydrates (MGHs), which have great potential for exploitation and utilization, account for around 99% of all global natural gas hydrate resources under current prospecting technique. However, there are several potential hazards associated with their production and development. These are classified into four categories by this paper: marine geohazards, greenhouse gas emissions, marine ecological hazards, and marine engineering hazards. In order to prevent these risks from occurring, the concept of “lifecycle management of hazards prevention” during the development and production from MGHs is proposed and divided into three stages: preparation, production control, and post-production protection. Of these stages, economic evaluation of the resource is the foundation; gas production methods are the key; with monitoring, assessment, and early warning as the guarantee. A production test in the Shenhu area of the South China Sea shows that MGH exploration and development can be planned using the “three-steps” methodology: commercializing and developing research ideas in the short term, maintaining economic levels of production in the medium term, and forming a global forum to discuss effective MGH development in the long term. When increasing MGH development is combined with the lifecycle management of hazards prevention system, and technological innovations are combined with global cooperation to solve the risks associated with MGH development, then safe access to a new source of clean energy may be obtained.",Wang F.; Zhao B.; Li G.,Journal,Energies,2018-01-01,China University of Mining and Technology,Greenhouse gas emission ;  Hazard prevention ;  Lifecycle management ;  Marine gas hydrate ;  Submarine landslide
Design principles for leveraging sustainability in business modelling tools,"Sustainability has become increasingly important to business research and practice. Approaches that support fundamental changes in behaviour to act economically, ecologically and socially are required. Modelling and analysing business models can contribute to this, for example by generating new ideas and enabling innovation as well as improving and evaluating current businesses. Although, the interest in business model innovation is booming, and software tools for business model development hold great promise for supporting business model innovation, there is only limited support and guidance for a tool-support that enables a satisfactory consideration of sustainability. Furthermore, there is currently a lack of comprehensive knowledge concerning which features can contribute to this consideration, and how they can be implemented. In this article, we report on the results of design science research (DSR) study that develops a set of design principles for reflecting sustainability in business models, which are refined and evaluated in several cycles. Our findings can support practitioners in (re-)designing tools, selecting and innovating business models, and-for researchers-can serve as a step towards more advances theories regarding software tools for sustainability in business modelling as well as for creating new business model ideas.",Schoormann T.; Behrens D.; Knackstedt R.,Conference Proceeding,"26th European Conference on Information Systems: Beyond Digitization - Facets of Socio-Technical Change, ECIS 2018",2018-01-01,Universität Hildesheim,Business Model ;  Business Modelling ;  Design Science ;  Sustainability ;  Tool-support
Accelerated construction of robust bridges through material and detailing innovations,"There is strong demand for construction innovations that facilitate rapid reconstruction of existing, degraded infrastructure. Robust solutions are needed so that infrastructure can uninterruptedly serve as the backbone of a modern economy. Given that the U.S. roadway network is largely built out, heavy demand focuses on in-service reconstruction with maintenance-free solutions. A significant advancement has been the push toward prefabrication of an ever-greater proportion of a bridge’s structure, thus allowing for changes to the project critical path and increases in component quality. The move toward prefabrication has occurred concurrently with the move toward the use of advanced materials and detailing practices for the connections between prefabricated bridge components. The research conducted at the Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center has been a key part of these advancements which are allowing higher quality bridges to be quickly constructed with the expectation of longer, uninterrupted service.",Graybeal B.; Haber Z.; De La Varga I.; Spragg R.,Conference Proceeding,"Maintenance, Safety, Risk, Management and Life-Cycle Performance of Bridges - Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Bridge Maintenance, Safety and Management, IABMAS 2018",2018-01-01,"Federal Highway Administration;SES Group & Associates, LLC",

Standardization and Quality Assurance in Life-Science Research - Crucially Needed or Unnecessary and Annoying Regulation?,"Open Science describes the ongoing transitions in the way research is performed, i.e. researchers collaborate, knowledge is shared, and science is organized. It is driven by digital technologies and by the enormous growth of data, globalization, enlargement of the scientific community and the need to address societal challenges [23]. It has now widely been recognized that making research results more accessible to all societal actors contributes to better and more efficient science, as well as to innovation in the public and private sectors [1, 17]. However, the reuse of research results can only be achieved reliably and efficiently, if these data are valorized in a specific manner. Data are to be generated, formatted and stored according to Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and according to sophisticated Data Management Plans [23]. Hence, to generate accurate and reproducible data sets, to allow interlaboratory comparisons as well as further and future use of research data it is mandatory to work in line with good laboratory practices and well-defined and validated methodologies. Within this article, members of the Cost Action CHARME [10] will discuss aspects of quality management and standardization in context with Open Access (OA) efforts.

Toward development tools for augmented reality applications – A practitioner perspective,"Augmented Reality (AR) commoditized development kits by Apple and Google, software products from IBM and PTC, and eyewear from Microsoft, Epson and ODG are driving a new wave of AR-based business use cases. Yet, today’s development tools for desktop or mobile applications do not natively contain aspects of natural interactions in such immersive environments. There is a gap between the need to understand and capture AR-related functional and non-functional requirements, and the state of modeling, testing, and simulation tools that AR developers have at their disposal. Specifically, how does one elicit and specify AR requirements, evaluate users’ experience, simulate and validate business usefulness. In addition, AR developers should assure that interactions with digital overlay are safe for people, and refrain from violating information security and privacy requirements. The paper discusses concerns for the creation of development tools for AR-based application, driven by a Visual Operation Guidance use case, and analyzed according to AR development steps of Object Recognition, Contextual Enrichment and Guidance. Exemplifying non-functional aspects, the paper presents new Safety, Privacy and Information Security concerns, triggered by investigating the nature of AR applications. It is the goal of this paper to inspire research by the academia to formally analyze, design and propose mapping and capturing these concerns in usable tools, that fit developers’ cognitive abilities, in order to expedite the creation of AR-based business processes and solutions.",Hadar E.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing,2018-01-01,Zefat Academic College;Accenture,Augmented reality ;  Business process innovation ;  Modeling tools ;  Privacy ;  Safety ;  Security

A literature review on the effectiveness and efficiency of business modeling,"Background: Achieving and maintaining a strategic competitive advantage through business and technology innovation via continually improving e ectiveness and e ciency of the operations are the critical survival factors for software-intensive product development companies. These companies invest in business modeling and tool support for integrating business models into their product development, but remain uncertain, if such investments generate desired results. Aim: This study explores the e ects of business modeling on e ectiveness and e ciency for companies developing software-intensive products. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review using the snowballing methodology, followed by thematic and narrative analysis. 57 papers were selected for analysis and synthesis, after screening 16 320 papers from multiple research fields. Results: We analyzed the literature based on purpose, benefit, challenge, e ectiveness, and e ciency with software and software-intensive products as the unit of analysis. The alignment between strategy and execution is the primary challenge, and we found no evidence that business modeling increases e ectiveness and e ciency for a company. Any outcome variations may simply be a result of fluctuating contextual or environmental factors rather than the application of a specific business modeling method. Therefore, we argue that governance is the fundamental challenge needed for business modeling, as it must e ciently support simultaneous experimentation with products and business models while turning experiences into knowledge. Conclusion: We propose a conceptual governance model for exploring the e ectiveness and e ciency of business modeling to occupy the missing link between business strategy, processes and software tools. We also recommend managers to introduce a systematic approach for experimentation and organizational learning, collaboration, and value co-creation.",Wilson M.; Wnuk K.; Silvander J.; Gorschek T.,Journal,E-Informatica Software Engineering Journal,2018-01-01,Blekinge Tekniska Högskola,Business model operationalization ;  Business modeling ;  Context-dependent ;  E ciency ;  E ectiveness ;  Governance ;  Literature review ;  Software-intensive product development

A hybrid machine learning approach for predictive maintenance in smart factories of the future,"Advanced technologies based on Internet of Things (IOT) are blazing a trail to effective and efficient management of an overall plant. In this context, manufacturing companies require an innovative strategy to survive in a competitive business environment, utilizing those technologies. Guided by these requirements, the so-called predictive maintenance is of paramount importance and offers a significant potential for innovation to overcome the limitations of traditional maintenance policies. However, real shop-floors often have obstacles in providing insights to facilitate the effective management of assets in smart factories. Even if a significant amount of machine and process data is available, one of the common problems of these data is the lack of annotations describing the machine status or maintenance history. For this reason, companies have limited options to analyse manufacturing data, despite the capability of advanced machine learning techniques in supporting the identification of failure symptoms in order to optimize scheduling of maintenance operations. Moreover, each machine generates highly heterogeneous data, making it difficult to integrate all the information to provide data-driven decision support for predictive maintenance. Inspired by these challenges, this research provides a hybrid machine learning approach combining unsupervised learning and semi-supervised learning.

New and emerging uses of CRISPR/Cas9 to genetically manipulate apicomplexan parasites,"Although the application of CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering approaches was first reported in apicomplexan parasites only 3 years ago, this technology has rapidly become an essential component of research on apicomplexan parasites. This review briefly describes the history of CRISPR/Cas9 and the principles behind its use along with documenting its implementation in apicomplexan parasites, especially Plasmodium spp. and Toxoplasma gondii. We also discuss the recent use of CRISPR/Cas9 for whole genome screening of gene knockout mutants in T. gondii and highlight its use for seminal genetic manipulations of Cryptosporidium spp. Finally, we consider new variations of CRISPR/Cas9 that have yet to be implemented in api-complexans. Whereas CRISPR/Cas9 has already accelerated rapid interrogation of gene function in apicomplexans, the full potential of this technology is yet to be realized as new variations and innovations are integrated into the field.",Di Cristina M.; Carruthers V.,Journal,Parasitology,2018-01-01,University of Michigan Medical School;Università degli Studi di Perugia,Apicomplexans ;  CRISPR/Cas9 ;  Genetic manipulation ;  Genome engineering ;  Recombination
Analyzing co-creation in educational living labs using the knowledge appropriation model,"In this paper, we introduce the knowledge appropriation model as an analytical framework to study co-creation processes in School-University Partnerships. The model explains transformative learning processes in the context of innovation adoption in organizations, communities, groups and individuals and how they are interconnected. We demonstrate the suitability of the model by describing several cases of Educational Living Labs currently being developed for introducing innovative teaching practices in STEM subjects in secondary schools. We derive a research model that relates co-creation in Living Labs to the eventual adoption of learning innovation in schools.",Ley T.; Leoste J.; Poom-Valickis K.; Rodríguez-Triana M.; Gillet D.; Väljataga T.,Conference Proceeding,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2018-01-01,Tallinna Ülikool;École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne,Co-Creation ;  Educational Innovation ;  Educational Living Labs
A Classification of Roles for Gamification in Business – a CHANGCE-Thinking Approach,"The CHANGCE-thinking mindset focuses on the identification and exploration of chances. As a part of this concept the CHANGCE-Game provides a systematic framework and ludic approach to discover an organization’s potential for improvement within a workshop setting. This method exploits the benefits of gamification to successfully initialize a change process within an enterprise. The case study within this research paper shows the advantages of incorporating roles as a game design element. The roles foster a change of perspective, thereby increasing creativity of workshop participants. This specific game element furthermore helps to break down hierarchies within teams and organizations, providing a criticism-free environment in which every opinion has equal value.",Janocha S.; Witzgall P.; Indefrey A.; Kapfhammer P.,Book Series,Communications in Computer and Information Science,2018-01-01,Technische Universität München;Pulse of Innovation Consulting,Change process ;  Gamification ;  Innovation ;  Role play
Agile Development and Operation of Complex Systems in Multi-technology and Multi-company Environments: Following a DevOps Approach,"Big innovation and research projects usually require merging contributions form organizations with expertise in different domains. Managing and participating in multi-company projects that use multiple state-of-the-art technologies constitute a challenging activity due to many factors such as integration inexperience, evolving components, tentative requirements, independent teams or independent management centers. In the late nineties and in the early years of 2000, several methodologies arose with the focus on fast releases of working software, commonly known as agile, that aimed to address many of the challenges that this kind of projects face. However, in most cases, these methodologies were not fully adoptable as the automation investment was too high and it was not recoverable during the duration of the project. The global servitization trend and the appearance of approaches, such as DevOps, to support the continuous and fast adjustment of those services to stay in business has also impacted innovation and research projects. On one hand, matured technologies that reduce the automation investment have arisen. On the other hand, whenever it makes sense, services which benefit from the application of DevOps approaches are required to be implemented. This paper explains the implementation of DevOps approaches to support the agile development in the context of innovation and research projects. It also describes two practical implementation cases where such approaches were implemented and how they evolved in the course of the time.",Benguria G.; Alonso J.; Etxaniz I.; Orue-Echevarria L.; Escalante M.,Book Series,Communications in Computer and Information Science,2018-01-01,TECNALIA,Agile ;  Continuous delivery ;  Continuous integration ;  DevOps
Reflections on the Need for Disambiguation of Terminology for Software Process Improvement,"Researchers often invent new terms or borrow terms from other domains which they modify or reinterpret by attaching novel meanings to suit the context of their investigation. In established disciplines, such as traditional engineering, physics, and mathematics, there is no ambiguity in the relevant terminology as terms as well as their relationships are expressed formally, mostly using mathematical equations. In Software Engineering the fact that there is a need for a glossary or lists of definitions at the end of every book and within nearly all research papers, is evidence that the discipline is not yet mature enough even after 50 years from the coining of the term Software Engineering. Refinements and re-interpretations of existing terms, combined with new terms introduced with every innovation, every new technology or tool, by both researchers and practitioners, result in ambiguities which need to be addressed. As change is inevitable there needs to be a mechanism through which ambiguities can be identified and addressed. This paper outlines major advances in Terminology Management for Software Process Improvement and reflects on the constant need for terminology disambiguation. It proposes a bottom-up pragmatic approach for using ontologies and for integrating research and practice. It also proposes a framework based on SPI Manifesto values and principles for the disambiguation of terms for continuous process improvement and, thus, for enhancing value and for catering for change which is inevitable.",Georgiadou E.,Book Series,Communications in Computer and Information Science,2018-01-01,Middlesex University,Communication ;  Disambiguation ;  Framework ;  Software measurement ;  SPI values & principles ;  Terminology
The issues of halal inspection process from the perspective of demand and supply side in malaysia halal certification system,"Halal inspection (HI) allows the auditor to perform a physical evaluation on the inspection site to ensure it follows the related standards and Islamic guidelines. HI is carried out as part of several important processes in Halal certification (HC) system where the end product is issued in the form of halal certificate and logo. But, HI is not an easy procedure and the complexity of it has become part of the major factor that contributes to several issues in HC field. Many scholars have studied the issues in HC but there are still lacking extensive research that focuses on HI process. This article attempts to describe the issue in HI which elaborated from the perspective of demand and supply side of HC in Malaysia. The key motivation of this study focuses on the changes to be implemented on HI process via the use of information technology such as virtual technology.

A Pedagogical Framework for Manufacturing Process Design,"In recent years, federal economists have argued that manufacturing is a vital part of the U.S. economy, providing a disproportionate share of engineering jobs, research and patents. At the center of these arguments is an understanding that manufacturing research and development is important to the innovation and competitiveness of manufacturing firms. As a result, federal agencies have made significant investments in public-private partnerships stimulating industry-directed research and development on university campuses. At the same time, state and federal agencies have increasingly encouraged the commercialization of university research for regional economic development. Combined, these investments have increased the amount of manufacturing engineering activity at U.S. universities providing opportunities to advance manufacturing engineering practice. This paper discusses efforts at Oregon State University to teach manufacturing process design based on twenty years of findings from efforts to translate microchannel process technology into the marketplace.",Paul B.; McNeff P.,Conference Proceeding,,2018-01-01,Oregon State University,Manufacturing Education ;  Manufacturing Process Design ;  Microchannel Process Technology
Benchmarking Undergraduate Manufacturing Engineering Curricula in the United States,"Advanced manufacturing is demanding universities and industry expand their perception of the role of manufacturing engineers in driving innovation and competitiveness. In turn, innovations in rapid, smart, and sustainable manufacturing require engineers to investigate new ways of making products for flexible and competitive production. In addition to the associated operational, technological, and strategic advantages for industry, advanced manufacturing creates national workforce and market opportunities. While universities play a key role in educating and preparing engineers to fulfil these needs of advanced manufacturing industry, existing undergraduate manufacturing engineering programs have not been reviewed to learn how well they are meeting the needs of industry. The objective of this research is to investigate the structure and composition of undergraduate manufacturing engineering programs in the U.S. universities accredited by ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Inc.). A database was compiled to document the curricular requirements of these programs. Course and topical requirements were then categorized using the SME Four Pillars of Manufacturing Knowledge model. The subsequent benchmarking results documented here provide an opportunity for universities and industries to identify topical areas that have garnered attention of curriculum developers, as well as identifying potential programmatic deficiencies relative to comparator programs. Thus, benchmarking study results can be used as a basis for defining how an undergraduate manufacturing engineering curriculum could be revised to better meet the human resource needs of advanced manufacturing industry.",Raoufi K.; Raman A.; Haapala K.; Paul B.,Conference Proceeding,,2018-01-01,College of Engineering,Accreditation Board for Engineering ;  Advanced Manufacturing ;  Benchmarking ;  Four Pillars of Manufacturing Knowledge ;  Inc.

Design of a STEM lecturer-training programme based on competencies,"In recent years the paradigm of teaching and learning has changed, with a plethora of research being conducted in this field, but all these changes and research have scarcely affected the lecturer training programmes. This paper presents a lecturer training programme implemented in a technical university and based on the competencies that lecturers should possess. To this end, we have conducted research to determine which competencies are essential and if our lecturers consider them important or are reluctant to acquire them. The programme is also designed to bring all the acquired techniques into the classroom and apply them to the student learning process. A further factor for the success of such training programmes is that lecturers should find them useful, not only for improved student performance, but also for their future professional careers, especially in an environment where promotion is dependent on papers published and grants obtained, and where education itself becomes a secondary objective. Our training programme started two years ago and since then has achieved all these goals, thereby creating a new network of lecturers committed to engineering education research and innovation.",Lopez D.; Perez-Poch A.,Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2018-01-01,Universitat Politécnica de Catalunya,Higher education teaching ;  Professional competencies ;  Teacher training ;  Teaching teachers
How engineering faculty interpret pull-oriented innovation development and why context matters,"Faculty development programs often operate as platforms for disseminating pedagogical innovations amongst engineering faculty, but adoption of these innovations into engineering classrooms has been less than desirable. Such issues of low adoption are partially due to the limited opportunity faculty have to pull innovation development towards their unique instructional contexts. However, little research to date has focused on understanding how engineering faculty would interpret such an opportunity to pull innovation development with their own curriculum in mind. The purpose of this study is to investigate a faculty development program wherein engineering faculty collaboratively developed curricular innovations for their mechanics of materials classroom with guidance from research on common student misconceptions. To explore the co-development of innovations, we conducted multiple interviews with the engineering faculty participants throughout the academic year. Participants interpreted this program and their co-developed curricular innovations as providing them with resources they needed to make curricular changes. Findings also demonstrated that faculty adoption of curricular innovations is highly influenced by context. By allowing faculty a greater role in the innovation development process, these contextual issues are more readily addressed. This study provides rich and detailed insight into how certain faculty approach adoption within their own contexts, which can improve faculty development and dissemination of pedagogical innovations in the future.",Barner M.; Brown S.; Lutz B.; Montfort D.,Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2018-01-01,Oregon State University,Adoption of innovations ;  Faculty development ;  Mechanics of materials ;  Pedagogical innovations
Impact of the initial training of engineering schools’ lecturers,"Nowadays, initial training courses for lecturers are widespread in universities. However, there are not enough research papers that analyze their impact and effectiveness. This paper focuses on the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid’s case. In order to assess if the teaching training received takes effect in the lecturers’ daily work, the study has collected data about 198 participants that have finished the Initial Training for University Teaching program. 115 of them answered a survey (adapted from Freixas et al.) analyzing the factors of their training transference. Participants acknowledged the learning value obtained during the program, indicating that they have implemented it in their own teaching practice. They perceive their students’ interest, who encourage them to introduce the methodological innovations learnt during their training. On the other hand, they do not perceive support from their departments. They detect lack of support (within the degrees and departments) as well as the lack of provided resources as the main barriers. The weight of tradition on how lecturers face teaching is relevant, restricting the possibilities for changes. Results show very limited institutional recognition to the effort invested in their own training. Nevertheless, participants keep optimistic expectations about the positive assessment of the received training for their teaching career.",Martín J.; Pablo-Lerchundi I.; Nuñez-Del-Rio M.; Del-Mazo-Fernandez J.; Bravo-Ramos J.,Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2018-01-01,Universidad Politécnica de Madrid,Engineer education ;  Initial training ;  Transfer of teacher training
"Smart Ceramics: Preparation, properties, and applications","Recent advances in nanotechnology have paved the way for the development of new smart materials. The term “smart ceramics” refers to ceramic materials fabricated from ultrafine particles. They have attracted the attention of researchers and scientists thanks to their potential to manipulate the length scale in the nanorange, leading to better and some unusual material properties. Smart ceramics ensure control of particle size, surface contamination, and degree of agglomeration. They play a crucial role in challenging applications such as bone surgery (e.g., the development of substitutes for load-bearing bone parts) and in biomedical science, especially in tissue engineering, dental applications, and drug and antigen delivery using modified ceramics. Porous nanostructured ceramics have potential use in both simple and complex applications, such as bioimaging, sensors, paints and pigments, optics, and electronics, because of their surface- and size-dependent properties. For the synthesis of smart ceramics, the sol-gel route has been mainly utilized because of its ability to produce a large variety of compositions and to ensure homogeneous mixing of the constituent particles at low temperature. This book describes the innovations in technologies through the development of functionalized ceramic materials for various applications. It also describes recent and expected challenges, along with their potential solutions, in advanced techniques for the synthesis and characterization of nanostructured ceramics and their composites: bioceramics, bioactive ceramics, multifunctional nanoceramics, transparent ceramics, nanocore shells, nanowires, thin films, nanotubes, and nanorods. The applications include the environment, health care, electrochemical sensors, high-temperature superconductors, nuclear reactor fuels, electrical insulators, refractory materials, electrical transformers, and magnetic core memory. The book will benefit researchers, scientists, engineers, and technologists working in the industry and in national and international research laboratories; academics who are interested in traditional and advanced smart ceramic composites; and students pursuing their postgraduate, graduate, and undergraduate degrees in smart ceramics, nanomaterials, nanoscience, and engineering.",Mishra A.,Book,"Smart Ceramics: Preparation, Properties, and Applications",2018-01-01,University of South Africa,
DEIS: Dependability Engineering Innovation for Industrial CPS,"The open and cooperative nature of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) poses new challenges in assuring dependability. The DEIS project (Dependability Engineering Innovation for automotive CPS. This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 732242, see http://www.deis-project.eu ) addresses these challenges by developing technologies that form a science of dependable system integration. In the core of these technologies lies the concept of a Digital Dependability Identity (DDI) of a component or system. DDIs are modular, composable, and executable in the field facilitating (a) efficient synthesis of component and system dependability information over the supply chain and (b) effective evaluation of this information in-the-field for safe and secure composition of highly distributed and autonomous CPS.

Chordwise actuation effects on NACA 0012 morphing airfoils,"Optimization of wing shapes has been a constant struggle throughout the years of aircraft and aerodynamic development. Innovations have flourished in all scientific fields that influence wing design, such as materials, structural, manufacturing and aeronautical engineering, in order to improve performance and consequently reduce fuel consumption of aircraft, which translates in a light wing with an airfoil shape that assures the best lift coefficients required for a specific mission. On the other hand, this penalizes other maneuver possibilities for the same aircraft, hindering its capabilities and demanding development of different solutions, impacting on costs and draining resources. An “one fits all” concept solves this hurdle, since one design could accomplish a variety of missions, with adequate values for lift coefficient for each different flight phase. This concept can be achieved by wings capable of morphing, adjusting their structures on demand. One widely investigated field of research is morphing wings that uses smart materials, such as shape memory alloys, for actuation. Shape memory alloys are lightweight, simple and cheap materials that, combined with a morphing compliant rib, can achieve controlled displacements on aerodynamic surfaces. This paper analyses different rib concepts modifying chordwise positions for actuation by making use of shape memory alloy wires built-in a NACA 0012 reference wing. A comparison is made between different percentages of chordwise morphing capability and a simple NACA 0012 wing with a 25 percent chord plain flap, as usually seen on many simple aircraft designs. The results show an increase on lift coefficient values and a delay of stall angle for some chordwise actuation locations. The comparison parameter was a 15 degree of trailing-edge tip displacement related to the airfoil leading-edge. By reducing external surface gaps and steps, a simple and lightweight smart morphing wing can overcome a common flap design and still achieve a variety of different missions by adjusting itself in flight.",Rocha Dos Santos A.; Caselato de Sousa G.; Rade D.; De Sousa Santos O.; De Paula A.,Conference Proceeding,2018 Applied Aerodynamics Conference,2018-01-01,Instituto Tecnologico de Aeronautica,
Promoting sustainability through national transport planning,"This following special issue of the European Journal of Transport Infrastructure Research (EJTIR) containing 4 scientific papers is the result of the work conducted under the research project ‘National Transport Planning – Sustainability, Institutions and Tools’ (SUSTAIN) (2012-2017) financed by the Danish Innovation Fund. SUSTAIN was coordinated by first the Department of Transport of the Technical University of Denmark (DTU Transport) and later as the result of a reorganisation of the transport research at DTU by the Department of Management Engineering (DTU Management Engineering). The project was carried out in cooperation with several Danish and international partners. In SUSTAIN the following definition of national sustainable transport planning (NSTP) was adopted: deliberate, knowledge-based, and strategic endeavours to integrate sustainability principles, criteria and goals in the development, management, regulation and assessment of nationally significant transport systems and services. This paper presents the research outcome by reviewing some of the major findings and seeing these collectively as a basis for promoting sustainability through the formulated research topic of NSTP. This basis includes defining criteria and indicators for use in NSTP combining evidence-based and performance oriented planning approaches. Furthermore, it contains a flexible evaluation framework that includes a decision support model that when informed by criteria and indicators can structure and assist an NSTP practice. This practice can support a planning process aiming at realising a sustainable transport development. Finally, the basis comprises a review of the complex political and administrative fabric in which NSTP is embedded, and thereby it can condition the ability to promote sustainability in practice.",Barfod M.; Leleur S.; Gudmundsson H.; Sørensen C.; Greve C.,Journal,European Journal of Transport and Infrastructure Research,2018-01-01,Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute;Copenhagen Business School;Technical University of Denmark;CONCITO,Decision support ;  Governance ;  Indicators ;  National transport planning ;  Sustainability
Techno-nationalism in the context of energy transition: Regulating technology innovation transfer in offshore wind technologies,"Techno-nationalism is governments’ protectionist behaviour towards technology innovation and transfer.- Development of law and policy to secure national interest stems from belief that restricting transfer of innovation will benefit national economic growth and protect wealth and energy independency. Although not a new phenomenon, there is a global techno-nationalism revival in the energy transition context. This chapter looks at the compatibility of techno-nationalist measures with the WTO international law regime. It reviews how national legal frameworks support these policies by reference to energy transition legislation, public procurement, local content requirements, and intellectual property rights. It compares nation states’ techno-nationalism behaviour to the duties to share and transfer technology innovation in a liberalized and competitive environment. Among the applicable rules are UNFCC and WTO technology transfer requirements, including green goods provisions. Finally, the margin of appreciation for national governments and the need for legal innovation to ensure technology transfer are examined.",Banet C.,Book,Innovation in Energy Law and Technology: Dynamic Solutions for Energy Transitions,2018-01-01,Universitetet i Oslo,Export subsidies ;  Green goods ;  Intellectual property rights ;  Offshore wind ;  Public procurements ;  Techno-globalism ;  Techno-nationalism ;  Technology transfer ;  Unfccc ;  Wto
Trends in failure studies of generation engines based on statistical models from 2007 to 2017,"The diagnosis of failures in Internal Combustion Engines (ICM)-generation engines, has been considering one of the principal thematic axes of academic and industrial Research, Development and Innovation (R & D & I) based on the analysis of the specialized engineering literature within the Distributed Generation (DG) paradigm. With the aim of presenting the characteristics of the work related to failures in ICM and recognizing the global research focuses, a scientometric methodological approach of a systematic review of the publications indexed in Web of Science (WoS) has been carrying out from the perspective of bibliometric analysis for the period from 2007 to 2017. The H-index has been incorporating into this analysis to assess the visibility and impact of journals, authors, countries, and institutions with the highest levels of production and recognition in the field under study. The systematic review also made it possible to analyze the interaction between knowledge groups and networks with the authors and institutions identified in the ranking. The results show a significant increase in the number of publications, especially between 2012 and 2016, which allow the main dimensions of R & D & I related to the study of failures in ICM to be characterized and illustrated at a holistic level and provide added value to researchers interested in establishing cooperation and publication processes with journals, authors, institutions and potential actors in the study of ICM failures.",Yulineth Cardenas E.; Guillermo Valencia O.; Eras J.,Journal,Journal of Engineering Science and Technology Review,2018-01-01,"Universidad de la Costa;Universidad del Atlántico, Colombia",Bibliometric analysis ;  H-index ;  Internal combustion engines ;  Scientometrics ;  Web of science
CHAPTER 22: The Usefulness of Direct Digital Manufacturing for Biomedical Applications,"Societies have been witnessing a constant increase in technology development. Likewise, the manufacturing process is shifting from a scope of massive production to massive customization. Thus, Direct Digital Manufacturing has emerged as a technical innovation that reduces the capital required to achieve emerging economies and breaks the current constraints, creating opportunities for companies to improve innovation, growth and performance. Its usage in biomedical applications has huge potential due to its ability to produce tailored products. This chapter highlights its use in the pharmaceutical domain, for surgical planning and training, and for tissue engineering. These areas of research can overlap the drawbacks of conventional methods in exploring advances in the design and printing processes. With constant evolution of the available (bio)materials and improved printing processes, enabling rapid production, complex geometries can be pursued. Examples are provided for each domain, demonstrating the future trends for adopting this manufacturing practice in our society.",Morouço P.,Book Series,RSC Green Chemistry,2018-01-01,Polytechnic Institute of Leiria,

Production of glass filters by selective laser sintering,"Glass filters are often used in the field of medical technology and chemical analysis to separate particles of a defined size out of liquids. Depending on the application, different pore width from 1.6 μm to 500 μm are necessary. Glass materials are particularly suitable, because a high purity, the chemical resistance and a high thermal resistance of the filter are necessary. Traditionally, these glass filters are produced by conventional sintering. In the new investigations, selective laser sintering is investigated as an alternative method. The conventional sintering process allows defined pore sizes to be adjusted by varying the sintering time. The high purity of the glass filters can be achieved by a binder-free production. The material properties of the glass material, such as the chemical resistance or thermal stability is maintained by the sintering process. Typically, fused silica or borosilicate glasses are used as basis materials. High-temperature selective laser sintering (HT-SLS) is an additive manufacturing process for the production of silicate and porous components. This manufacturing technology allows complex and unconventional geometrics to be realized efficiently and flexibly. For this purpose, the volume model to be produced is first separated into the desired layer geometry and number of layers. In the subsequent specific process cycle, the glass powder is distributed by a squeegee on a building platform in a defined manner. A solid material layer is created by means of scanning CO2 laser radiation. After lowering the building platform and transporting the powder again, the component can be generated layer by layer. For the production of the glass filters by HT-SLS, initial investigations are carried out with synthetic and natural fused silica glass powders with particle diameters in the range of 19. 78 μm in spheroidized and vitrified form. A laser sintering furnace has been specially designed for the HT-SLS, which achieves process temperatures up to T = 1000 °C as well as low contamination of the glass powder. In addition, material-specific scan and parameter concepts are developed. A high component quality can be achieved by combining a hull-and-core scan strategy with a 180° scan field rotation each sintered layer. Also a bidirectional beam guide and a material-specific parameter concept is needed. The absorption of CO2 laser radiation and the heat-conduction of the powder are supported by the process-dependent plasma and the preheating of the building platform. The generated porous components are investigated with regard to the density and the bending strength. Component densities of ρ = 65 % and bending strengths of σ = 13.6 MPa are achieved. Basically, HT-SLS is an alternative method to the classical sintering process of glass powder to produce glass filters. In particular, an increase in efficiency with regard to the producible component geometry of the porous components can be achieved. This new technology offers a high degree of innovation, while at the same time requiring a high level of research.",Schwager A.; Bliedtner J.; Bruder A.; Götze K.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,2018-01-01,Fachhochschule Jena,additive manufacturing ;  CO  laser radiation 2 ;  glass powder ;  isostatic pressing ;  Selective laser beam sintering ;  silica glass ;  temperature pressure sintering
PSS design through Design for Supply Chain: State of the art review,"Design for X (DfX) approaches are very important for designing products with a focus on whole lifecycle, to achieve cost reduction and product quality. The move to achieve competitiveness and unique offerings have resulted in the switch from a product to a Product Service Systems (PSS) business model. DfX concept is insufficient to address the complexity of PSS, therefore, additional concepts such as Design for Product Service Supportability (DfPSSu) are emerging. Existing research argued the role of support in ensuring customer satisfaction, revenue generation etc., which strengthens the motivation for PSS and servitization. The integration of support services into PSS has initiated the focus on DfPSSu, aiming at the synergic use of the different DfX approaches to concurrently support the services with the product features according their own heterogeneity. PSS complexity necessitates collaboration within the Supply Chain (SC) to deliver value to the customer, yet existing research focuses on individual firms. This highlights the importance of value creation in Design for SC (DfSC) in order to achieve competitiveness. This research would explore DfX from a value creation perspective while investigating the place of DfSC into the DfPSSu concept. This because DfSC encourages innovation in linking product design, process design and SC design together, according to the Concurrent Engineering paradigm. While there is need to DfSC, this idea is under-researched in literature. This paper would share the findings from a state of the art review of DfSC in relation to DfPSSu, identifying the evolution of the concept while identifying much research gap in understanding and application of this concept in theoretical and empirical research.",Ebikake O.; Sassanelli C.; Terzi S.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2018-01-01,Politecnico di Milano;Edge Hill University,Design for Product Service Supportability (DfPSSu) ;  Design for Supply Chain (DfSC) ;  Design for X (DfX) ;  Product Service System (PSS)
Increased hydropower potential at niagara: A scenario-based analysis,"Research often ranges from incremental innovations of existing approaches to the development of novel methodologies. The current study seeks to combine both paradigms through consideration of a legacy hydro system. Stretched along the border between Canada and the US and regulated by a 1950 treaty, the Niagara River currently provides almost 5000 MW of renewable power. This paper develops a HEC-ResSim representation of the existing reservoir (power) system and uses this model to explore a variety of possible future scenarios. These possibilities will ultimately include considering the sensitivity of the system to climate change, reducing tourist flows, and exploring using additional storage to augment operational flows, although the current paper particularly details the scenario involving increased power diversion by somewhat relaxing treaty restrictions. Such an arrangement is shown to potentially increase monthly hydro discharges by 16% relative to the current baseline, and thus to permit an additional 1050 GWh of annual generation on the Canadian side alone. This preliminary exploratory study simply evaluates the potential hydro benefits by assessing the interplay between various system constraints if treaty provisions were ever to be reconsidered, and thus sets the stage for considering a variety of other scenarios.",Tahseen S.; Drake J.; Karney B.,Journal,Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering,2018-01-01,University of Toronto,HEC-resSim ;  Niagara river ;  Power systems ;  Reservoir operation ;  Simulation ;  Treaty

Access differences of diagnostic services between small hospitals and the super hospital,"We face various problems to be solved when examining Hungarian health care. The intensifying of the burdens on health care workers, the continuous increase of the number of patients, the increase of the length of waiting time discernible for years now, the disorganization of the processes, the lack of financial assets and the growing number of migration among physicians can all lead to the collapse of the currently operating system. As a corollary to the current situation, the system is becoming more and more challenging to be operated; and the decision makers have a serious responsibility to properly optimize this field, which is strongly decisive for the economy as a whole. The researches that the authors have conducted during the recent years suggest that one part of these problems can be solved by applying the management methodology which they have been knowing and applying for years now in various fields. The authors believe that the application of the methodology of Value Analysis can on the one hand help to discover, locate, characterize, typify and describe the problems; and on the other hand, the application of it might offer a solution in certain areas; because besides the fact that processes can be made more efficient, costs can be reduced as well to a certain extent, which pose the major challenges of health care at present. Nevertheless, the question of the applicability of this methodology to the field of health care can rightfully arise; and as a corollary to that, we are looking for the answer to the question how and with what results we can apply a management methodology originating in the military industry to a field where processes are very complex, and the human factor is significant. The authors have expanded various possible solutions leaning on the results of the analyses carried out in different fields of the health care system, which have raised further questions again and again due to the nature of the topic. They have chosen the analyses of the fields of surgical procedures and diagnostics within health care for the examination of the applicability of the methodology within the frames of health care; which took place with the involvement of medical specialists due to the nature of the topic. The authors believe that later, taking into account the results of the research, the field of research can be expanded, and the results can be adapted to other areas of expertise.",Vamosi K.; Nadasdi F.; Totth G.,Conference Proceeding,"Value Summit 2018, Proceedings",2018-01-01,University of Dunaújváros;Budapest Business University,Diagnostics ;  Health care ;  Innovation ;  Process improvement ;  Surgical technique ;  Value analysis ;  Value engineering
Research on the efficiency of green technology innovation in china's provincial high-end manufacturing industry based on the RAGA-PP-SFA Model,"This study offers a RAGA-PP-SFA model to measure green technology's innovation efficiency in the high-end manufacturing industry. The study's aim is to solve the shortcomings of traditional SFA methods that are unable to improve multi-output efficiency. The RAGA-PP-SFA model presented here is based on the multi-emission and multi-output characteristics of high-end manufacturing innovation activities. Using panel data from 2010 to 2015 on China's high-end manufacturing industry and considering factors such as environmental regulation, government subsidy, and market maturity, this paper empirically examines and compares the efficiency of green technology innovation versus traditional technology innovation, as well as regional heterogeneity in China's high-end manufacturing industry. The study ultimately found a low level of green technology innovation efficiency in China's high-end manufacturing industry. However, an overall rising trend shows that the green development of China's high-end manufacturing industry has achieved remarkable results. Green technology innovation efficiency in high-end manufacturing industries across various regions was generally lower than the efficiency of traditional technology innovation. Both types of efficiency showed a pattern of ""high in the east and low in the middle and in the west"". High-high efficiency is primarily found in the east, whereas the west is characterized by low-low efficiency. There are significant differences between regions, pointing to an equal rate of development. Government subsidies and enterprise scale had a significant negative impact on green technology innovation efficiency in regional high-end manufacturing industries, while market maturity and industrial agglomeration had a significant positive impact. Based on the study's findings, environmental regulation and openness to the outside world play insignificant roles in green technology innovation efficiency.",Li T.; Liang L.; Han D.,Journal,Mathematical Problems in Engineering,2018-01-01,Harbin Engineering University,
Collaborative approach in software engineering education: An interdisciplinary case,"Aim/Purpose This study was aimed at enhancing students' learning of software engineering methods. A collaboration between the Computer Science, Business Management, and Product Design programs was formed to work on actual projects with real clients. This interdisciplinary form of collaboration simulates the realities of a diverse Software Engineering team. Background A collaborative approach implemented through projects has been the established pedagogy for introducing the Software Engineering course to undergraduate Computer Science students. The collaboration, however, is limited to collabora-tion among Computer Science students and their clients. This case study explored an enhancement to the collaborative approach to project development by integrating other related disciplines into the project development framework; hence, the Interdisciplinary Approach. Methodology This study adopted the case method approach. An interdisciplinary service innovation activity was proposed to invite other disciplines in the learning process of the computer science students. The agile methodology Scrum was used as the software development approach during project development. Survey data were collected from the students to establish (a) their perception of the interdiscipli-nary approach to project development; (b) the factors that influenced success or failure of their team to deliver the project; and (c) the perceived skills or knowledge that they acquired from the interdisciplinary approach. Analysis of data followed a mixed method approach. Contribution The study improved the current pedagogy for Software Engineering education by integrating other related disciplines into the software project development framework. Findings Data collected showed that the students generally accepted the interdisciplinary approach to project development. Factors such as project relevance, teamwork, time and schedule, and administration support, among others, affect team per-formance towards project completion. In the case of the Computer Science stu-dents, results show that students have learned skills during the experience that, as literature reveal, can only be acquired or mastered in their future profession as software engineers. Recommendations for Practitioners The active collaboration of the industry with the University and the involvement of the other related courses in teaching software engineering methods are critical to the development of the students, not only in learning the methodology but also as a working professional. Recommendation for Researchers It is interesting to know and eventually understand the interactions between in-terdisciplinary team members in the conduct of Software Engineering practices while working on their projects. More specifically, what creative tensions arise and how do the interdisciplinary teams handle the discourse? Impact on Society This study bridges the gap between how Software Engineering is taught in the university and how Software Engineering teams work in real life. Future Research Future research is targeted at refining and elaborating the elements of the inter-disciplinary framework presented in this paper towards an integrated course module for Software Engineering education.",Vicente A.; Tan T.; Yu A.,Journal,Journal of Information Technology Education: Innovations in Practice,2018-01-01,University of the Philippines Cebu,Collaborative approach ;  Interdisciplinary learning ;  Software engineering education
Towards a unified understanding of ehealth and related terms – proposal of a consolidated terminological basis,"The impact of digitization on healthcare gives rise to interdisciplinary concepts such as eHealth. However, achieving improvements in research and innovation requires a valid and unified understanding of the common terminology. Yet, a heterogeneous usage of different terms regarding eHealth can be observed. This leads to a deficient communication between researchers and practitioners, impeding the diffusion, i. e. extensive practical implementation of innovative health concepts. To address this problem, our aim is to consolidate and harmonize eHealth-related terminology. To this end, a literature analysis was conducted to identify established definitions and to formulate a terminological ontology for the related concepts. The current results show a consistent definition of the terms digitization, ICT, and telematics. In contrast, telemedicine, telehealth, eHealth, and mHealth were identified as conflictingly defined terms. Consequently, the proposed ontology serves as a first guidance to support an adequate use of the included terms. Further systematic research of terms is needed to verify the current concept of the ontology. Additionally, specifying the connection between the ontology and the elements of healthcare systems is required for a deeper understanding of the influence of digitization in healthcare.",Otto L.; Harst L.; Schlieter H.; Wollschlaeger B.; Richter P.; Timpel P.,Conference Proceeding,"HEALTHINF 2018 - 11th International Conference on Health Informatics, Proceedings; Part of 11th International Joint Conference on Biomedical Engineering Systems and Technologies, BIOSTEC 2018",2018-01-01,Medizinische Fakultät Carl Gustav Carus;Technische Universität Dresden,EHealth ;  MHealth ;  Telehealth ;  Telemedicine ;  Terminological Ontology
Comparison of under ballast mat performance with different support conditions through laboratory experiment and numerical simulation,"Under-ballast mats (UBMs) have become more popular recently in railroad track engineering. Benefits of introducing an under-ballast mat layer(s) into the track include, but are not limited to: increasing track resilience, reducing ballast breakage, decreasing noise and vibration, and protecting bridge decks. One of the most essential parameters used to evaluate the performance of UBMs is the bedding modulus. Currently, the German Deutsches Institut für Normung (DIN) 45673 is the only test standard specifying procedures to quantify UBM bedding modulus by placing the UBM between two steel plates. However, steel plates might not be an ideal representation of the actual track loading environment. Thus, other types of support conditions have been used to test the UBM bedding modulus, including concrete block and the geometric ballast plate (GBP) specified by European Standard (EN) 16730. How these different support conditions affect the performance of an UBM has not been fully investigated. To better quantify the effects of varying support conditions on UBM bedding modulus, testing was performed in the Research and Innovation Laboratory (RAIL) in University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). It was found that for a specific type of UBM, the tested bedding modulus values were similar when supported by the steel plate or concrete block, while the value was considerably lower when the mat was supported by the GBP. Finite element simulations were performed to further study the stress distributions under these various support conditions. The results from this study can help practitioners better represent the application environment during the UBM bedding modulus tests by suggesting the appropriate support condition.",Qian Y.; Zhu K.; De Oliveira Lima A.; Dersch M.; Edwards J.,Conference Proceeding,"2018 Joint Rail Conference, JRC 2018",2018-01-01,"University of South Carolina;University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign;Saiful/Bouquet Structural Engineers, Inc.",
Change management: Blended learning adoption in a large network of European universities,"We report in this paper on a multiyear endeavour within the EIT (European Institute of Innovation and Technology) Digital community, during which EIT Digital built an international community of Innovation and Entrepreneurship (“I&E”) teachers at Master level by implementing a blended learning strategy. We see this challenge as a case in change management, which could offer relevant insight to run similar initiatives of blending learning adoption as an enabler to developing pedagogical cooperation in networks of universities with real impact on practices. Through the lenses of change management theory, we describe and analyse the methods that allowed EIT Digital to create and enhance a community of “teacher-producers” in order to develop and deploy blended education from scratch. EIT Digital, a Knowledge and Innovation Community of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), provides IT education at Master’s level since 2013 and in association with its around 20 member universities, including a strong “Innovation & Entrepreneurship” (“I&E”) education component. EIT Digital developed a blended learning strategy whose originality came from the fact that some of the teachers are also producers on behalf of the entire community, receiving associated co-funding and technical support from EIT Digital. More specifically, teachers actively took part to the production agenda, according to which producers were chosen within the community to create and deliver the agreed online contents. EIT Digital library now encompasses more than 500 basic online contents (“nuggets”) covering most topics relevant for I&E education at the graduate level, from basic business model introductions to complex technology transfer strategies. This amounts to more than 45 hours’ worth of videos along with dozens of written cases, quizzes and other forms of online/offline assignments. Depending on the various universities’ contexts, different blending strategies were deployed, which had practical consequences on the global EIT Digital development. The heterogeneity of the universities’ profiles probably significantly increased the value of the EIT Digital network which proved relevant with regards to blended learning adoption, while EIT Digital’s change management strategy contributed significantly to uplifting the I&E education offered at the member universities, notably giving momentum to its I&E teacher community.",Dion G.; Dalle J.; Renouard F.; Guseva Y.; León G.; Marchese M.; Mutanen O.; Stranger A.; Pisoni G.; Stoycheva M.; Tejero A.; Vendel M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Conference on e-Learning, ICEL",2018-01-01,Aalto University;Université de Rennes;Universidad Politécnica de Madrid;Università di Trento;The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH);Sorbonne Université;Agoranov;Digital Europe,Blended learning ;  Change management ;  Community of Practice ;  Teacher-Producers ;  User-Innovators
Transforming Instruction to Chemical Product Design,"This paper describes the progress of our efforts to lead the CACHE (Computer Aids for Chemical Engineering Education) Task Force in transforming from chemical process design toward chemical product design. Through CACHE, we are coordinating the development of a library of product-design case studies. Beginning with preliminary product designs created previously over several semesters, we are arranging for faculty experts, knowledgeable in the underlying technology platforms, to work with student groups to enrich the product designs. Over a 3-year period, a collection of approximately 25 case studies is being prepared. This article describes the research envisioned as innovative product designs are created, both regarding applications of new technologies, and product design evolution/evaluation; and in advancing strategies for teaching product design. The anticipated use of these case studies in departments worldwide for design courses taught by similar technology experts, just a few in each department, is discussed. These will align with the expertise of the faculty members, who will help undergraduate student design groups gain the technology skills to carry out specific design projects.",Ng K.; Seider W.,Book Series,Computer Aided Chemical Engineering,2018-01-01,School of Engineering and Applied Science;Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,innovation ;  product design ;  teaching assessment ;  technology platforms

How Al and Robotics can support marine mining,"Marine Mining initiatives open up a completely new field of subsea operations. Offshore oil and gas sites are still primarily located in areas, where divers can support maintenance and repair, while future marine mining will take place in greater depths and with a complexity of machines that require support from robotic systems equipped with a substantial amount of artificial intelligence. At the Robotics Innovation Center, a department of the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI), technologies are being developed that have the potential to support marine mining in all stages from prospection to decommissioning. Various robotic technologies from systems, subsea-residence operation, inspection manipulation as well as autonomy are presented in the following chapters. Finally, a proposition for a robotic mining system is presented, that strives for minimal invasiveness of the marine environment.",Kampmann P.; Christensen L.; Fritsche M.; Gaudig C.; Hanff H.; Hildebrandt M.; Kirchner F.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the Annual Offshore Technology Conference,2018-01-01,Universität Bremen,
Study on the Attitude of Young People Towards Technology,"The attitude young people have when facing the challenge of technology can make the difference between being able to cope safely in this society or being relegated to a marginal position. The aim of this research is to know which is that attitude in a group of university studentes. To this end, we have proposed a survey in which we asked about different aspects in order to compare the results in our university with the contributions of three well-known theories: the Gartner’s Hype Cycle, the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, and the Rogers’ Theory of the Diffusion of Innovations. In this paper, in particular, we have presented how students adopt technology by classifying them into the five categories Rogers raises. The analysis of the survey results states that, in general, our students present a higher number of innovators than those observed by Rogers, and a lower number of laggards. We have also found a significant difference in the time of adoption of a new technology depending on the area of knowledge of the students’ courses (engineering and architecture students adopt technologies earlier than social science students) but there are no statistically significant differences when comparing by gender.",Huedo-Martínez S.; Molina-Carmona R.; Llorens-Largo F.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2018-01-01,Universitat d'Alacant,Adoption of technology ;  Attitude towards technology ;  Diffusion of Innovation

Energy industry: Effectiveness from innovations,"Putting the energy industry on the way of innovations is a task of utmost importance, whose success will shape up future development and competitiveness of emerging economies to a great extent. Research of the main trends of innovative development of distributed generation demonstrated that they are characterized by high spending both on installation of innovative power equipment and on its creation. Our research of financing in the Russian distributed energy and power engineering demonstrated that the bulk of capital investment is done from companies’ own funds, which points to the unaffordability of other funding instruments, credit included. Consequently, the process of creating and using innovations in distributed energy is accompanied by significant investment risks. This scientific research offers an approach to innovations in distributed energy based on coordination of economic interests of innovation process subjects with the aim of optimizing the task of looking for a threshold price through defining and comparing the effectiveness of a novelty for its creators, consumers and the state with the help of an internal rate of return. The use of a business approach to the introduction of innovations in the distributed energy will coordinate the interests of the producer of innovative equipment and the energy company.

3D micro-mirror lithography for mass production,"This paper address how additive manufacturing will revolutionize production and manufacturing industries, and ultimately determine the scope of what is possible to create. Due to its versatility, additive manufacturing will allow more efficient and cost-effective means of production, prototyping, and innovation. Additive manufacturing can create new parts and devices opening up new channels of change in emerging industries, such as microfluidics, medical, and dental. This evolution is equally as critical to private and public entities who desire a competitive edge over the manufacturing market, on both a national and global scale. Digital Light Projection (DLP) technology, kinetic absorption framework, and software algorithms constituted our basis for the engineering and design aspect of a custom method of additive manufacturing capable of meeting the demands of mass production. With the barriers mentioned above in mind, this device was built to compensate in accuracy, precision (>1 micron) and speed in the resolution of all areas of X, Y, Z orientations, coupled with a large build volume. Strategic algorithms were inserted into object fabrication to achieve parts with a superior surface finish and dimensional accuracy at rapid speeds (<5 mins per 50mm). For validation, we contrasted surface finish against other additive manufacturing solutions available on the market, using the same STL file. We compared the printed parts under a microscope and identified statistically significant differences (p>0.001) between the finished products. Our method proved superior regarding dimensional accuracy and surface finish. The technology and methods applied in this paper are a step toward key gains in manufacturing-decreased production time, more efficient use of materials and personnel, and cost efficiency. As additive manufacturing evolves, it continues to shape the way humankind thinks about production, creation, and manufacturing while simultaneously expanding research opportunities in ways never before possible.",Liverman N.; Delly E.; Haugabrook L.; Fregin T.; Moore N.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,2018-01-01,Old World Labs,3D Printing ;  Additive Manufacturing ;  Computational Lithography ;  DMD ;  MEMS ;  META ;  Microfluidics ;  OPC

Cyclic behavior of precast segmental UHPFRC bridge columns with replaceable damage-concentrated elements,"A novel precast segmental bridge column was put forward innovatively to contribute to accelerated bridge construction and rapid repair of bridge after earthquake, which is in accordance with the theme called engineering innovations for rapid urbanisation. The proposed bridge column was manufactured with cost-effective ultrahigh performance fiber-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) incorporating river sand and coarse aggregate. As the potential damaged region, the bottom segment was composed of three parts: inner core zone designed to bear axial loading, outer replaceable UHPFRC plates (RUP) designed to bear lateral loading, and middle replaceable steel dissipaters (RSD) designed to enhance energy dissipation (ED), when the entire bridge structure was subjected to earthquake shock. The rapid repair after earthquake was completed with substitutions of replaceable damage-concentrated elements including RUP and RSD. Cyclic loading tests were conducted on three 1:3 scaled specimens and their repaired specimens. The research parameters included posttensioning (PT) force level and usage of RSD. Test results show that both construction and repair can be very time-saving for the proposed bridge column. Major damage focuses on replaceable damage-concentrated elements while remaining parts are basically intact. All the specimens present good deformation capacity and excellent self-centering feature. Two different failure modes can be found: some specimens failed in the lateral bearing capacity while others failed in the ED capacity. Compared with the original specimen failed in the same failure mode, the repaired specimen has similar lateral bearing capacity and deformation capacity but seriously weakened initial stiffness.",Wang Z.; Wang J.; Zhu J.,Conference Proceeding,"IABSE Conference, Kuala Lumpur 2018: Engineering the Developing World - Report",2018-01-01,Southeast University,Bridge column ;  Cyclic loading test ;  Precast segmental construction ;  Replaceable element ;  Resilience ;  Self-centering ;  Ultrahigh performance fiber-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC)

Safety status: An innovative concept for maintaining the safety integrity level of operational safety systems,"The safety of industrial sites or large research facilities such as CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) is obtained by the combined actions of physical security, cyber-security and functional safety that jointly contribute to risk reduction. To deal with functional safety, the IEC 61508-61511-61513 standards are used for regulating design, development and maintenance of the Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) that implement Safety Instrumented Functions. The SIF’s performance is characterized by its Safety Integrity Level (SIL) determined through a risk analysis and conditioned by parameters related to the design, the staff’s skills involved in its development, operation and maintenance or the compliance with repairing times. Heads of facility and SIS responsible persons have to continuously master the SIL performance. This is a responsible act to guarantee the risks reduction barriers efficiencies, considering criteria such as periodic testing, spare parts availability, components obsolescence, by-passes, changes control, system real-time status, physical and cyber protections. The Safety Status software imagined jointly by CERN and ASSYSTEM inherits both the CERN experience on the specification and operation of safety systems adapted to the specific risks of particle accelerators and experiments and the know-how developed by ASSYSTEM as a major player in the engineering of nuclear installations, particularly in the field of design and maintenance of critical security and control systems. Safety Status establishes a functional safety dashboard of each system updated automatically or manually with data coming from relevant sources such as maintenance management, document management or the SIS itself. Through a friendly interface, it displays an overview of all the useful information that illustrates the health of the SIS and the integrity of its safety functions. After introducing the concept, the paper presents the methodology, the main features of the software, and the experience feedback gained by its implementation on the CERN MEDICIS facility.",Ninin P.; Salatko C.; Valbom J.,Journal,International Journal of Safety and Security Engineering,2018-01-01,Organisation Européenne pour la Recherche Nucléaire,Safety system engineering ;  Security global approach ;  SIS operation & maintenance
EDUCATE: Creating the Golden Triangle for research-informed industrial collaborations within education technology,"EDUCATE is a London-based partnership that supports and promotes the use of research-based education technology, allowing entrepreneurs and start-ups to develop their products and services, and grow their companies in an evidence-informed manner. The EDUCATE process connects businesses with researchers who will mentor, guide and support them on their research journey. A key aspect of this research journey is the evaluation of the emerging technology being developed by each business that works with the EDUCATE programme. However, conducting impact evaluations of technology in education is challenging, particularly so for emerging technologies, as innovation and change are their essence. Here, we present a pragmatic approach to impact evaluations of emerging technologies in education which we use within the EDUCATE project.

Factors affecting innovation in engineering design teams: An empirical investigation of student team perceptions,"Innovation is a catalyst for economic growth, competitiveness, and sustainability worldwide. Knowledge has been identified as a key driving force for innovation usually resulting in intellectual property as a reward for creativity. Engineers of today are expected to possess abilities for teamwork, creativity, and innovation in order to meet the challenges and complexities of the 21st century. However, there is insufficient empirical evidence explaining the organizational, social and cognitive processes affecting innovation among engineering student design teams—the engineers of tomorrow. The research addresses the question: What are the factors affecting Innovation in engineering student design teams? The study advances a framework for engineering student team innovation and uses survey data from a representative ABET accredited four-year institution of higher learning involving 709 participants constituting 210 design teams from 40 design sections across nine academic departments at a college of engineering during an academic year. Validity and reliability of the survey instrument were obtained by using pre-existing scales, a pilot test, factor analyses, and scale reliability analysis. Other analyses involved aggregation analysis, ANOVA, correlation, and hierarchical linear modeling. A validated 59-item survey scale was realized. Perceived engineering student team innovation is found to be significantly related to leadership, support for innovation, rewards, team size, communication, task orientation, effort, learning, cohesion, conflict and participative safety at the team level. Most study findings agree with general organization team innovation literature with exceptions of participative safety and support for innovation. Findings from the study have implications for the improvement of engineering design curriculum and provide a framework for endeavors to harness skills for teamwork and innovation among engineering graduates through enhancing or regulating the determinants of innovation. A linear model for assessing team innovation among engineering students is elaborated in the study.",Asio S.; Cross J.; Ekwaro-Osire S.,Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2018-01-01,Edward E.

Effective learning of innovation by engineering students in a multi-disciplinary context,"The teaching of innovation to engineers is often fraught with challenges and misgivings, as the definition of innovation itself, often confused with invention and research and development, is still a subject of research in the fields of science, engineering and management. In this paper, we offer the results of a novel graduate-level engineering course that attempts to develop among its students the ability to identify, define and manage innovation within a project-based and multidisciplinary context, and in a manner that is stakeholder-centric. We present in this paper for the first time a Universal Innovation Framework that offers a practical and distinctive approach to the teaching and management of innovation that foregrounds societal impact as opposite to technical prowess. Preliminary results show a significant impact of the course on student understanding and perception of innovation.",Belkhir L.; Fleisig R.; Potter D.,Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2018-01-01,McMaster University,Engineering design education ;  Engineering management ;  Entrepreneurship education ;  Immersion ;  Innovation ;  Innovation education ;  Management of innovation ;  Multidisciplinary pedagogy ;  Problem-based learning ;  Project-based learning ;  Public policy education
Project management in higher education institutions in Mexico: A case study,"Project management (PM) is considered a determining factor in the success of collaborative innovation and technological development projects carried out by universities and private companies. This work presents the findings of a study carried out in the Faculty of Engineering of the Autonomous University of Querétaro (FIUAQ) that aimed to determine the level of maturity in project management of the faculty members. Their level of maturity is also linked with the perception of success (in terms of satisfaction level) of the companies that collaborated with the FIUAQ in research and innovation projects. Knowing the level of maturity in project management of its members is important for the FIUAQ, since it aims to incorporate a Project-Based Learning Model (PBL) in the curriculum of undergraduate and graduate students, encouraging their participation in collaborative projects between academia and industry.

Towards Context-Aware Vehicle Navigation in Urban Environments: Modeling Challenges,"Currently, urban vehicle navigation is considered important because smoothness of traffic is needed for the sake of safety and cleanliness of air; in this regard, people essentially count on GPS navigation. Nevertheless, due to signal building shadows, GPS signal disturbances may occur in an urban environment; then alternative navigation options should be considered. It is therefore a matter of context-awareness to establish whether or not GPS navigation is available and adjust the delivered navigation services accordingly. In this paper we propose a top-down approach for modeling context-aware vehicle navigation systems; firstly, a high-level technology-independent conceptual model is derived (featuring context-awareness in general) and then this model is mapped towards corresponding lower-level technical solutions. Even though research materials, touching upon context-awareness or vehicle navigation, can be found in literature, we miss holistic approaches that align high-level (conceptual) goals with navigation-specific (technical) solutions; hence, our proposal is considered a step forward in this regard. We also propose an innovation concerning the technical aspects of navigation. Our proposed approach is partially validated by means of experiments.",Garvanov I.; Kabakchiev C.; Shishkov B.; Garvanova M.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing,2018-01-01,University of Library Studies and Information Technologies;Sofia University St. Kliment Ohridski;Institute of Mathematics and Informatics Bulgarian Academy of Sciences;Institute IICREST,Context-awareness ;  GPS navigation ;  IT service
Reconciling the Academic and Enterprise Perspectives of Design Thinking,"Design Thinking has become popular in the management and innovation context but remains mostly misunderstood, as a result of broad interpretations and the lack of empirical research on the subject. This paper aims to reduce the gap between the academic and industrial perspectives on Design Thinking, by reviewing publications focused on three aspects: (1) studies aimed at defining the concept, (2) empirical case studies about its use or adoption, and (3) models or methods proposed to overcome its main challenges. The existing literature suggests that multiple definitions for Design Thinking coexist with some commonly understood design practices, both among designer and non-designer practitioners alike. The challenge most frequently mentioned is the clash of existing organizational structures with the flexibility and unpredictability of Design Thinking. This paper outlines two different approaches to address such challenge and proposes a definition that brings together the academic and enterprise perspectives of Design Thinking.",Camposano J.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing,2018-01-01,Aalto University,Design thinking ;  Enterprise ;  Innovation ;  Management ;  Organizations

Influence of continuous casting on the structure and properties of 1013 (AD1) alloy castings,"Casting production is the cheapest way of manufacturing semi-finished and/or finished products. Disadvantages of the castings obtained by this method are both their dimensional accuracy and properties that are significantly inferior to those of products obtained by metal forming methods. Therefore, the development of new technologies, settings and casting equipments that would provide castings with the structure, and hence, properties being similar or superior to those of deformed ones, is an urgent task. One way to improve the processing parameters of casting production is the crystallization of melts under the influence of external factors. So, the use of ultrasound, electromagnetic field and vibration leads to an improvement in alloy mechanical properties. However, these methods of producing cast parts which ensure improved mechanical properties do not allow the manufacture of longer billets. In industries, particularly in aircraft manufacturing, the production of long billets with high mechanical properties for a short production cycle is an important production scientific and technical task. The purpose of this work is to create regimes for obtaining such products by the continuous casting method on the device developed by the authors. To achieve the goal, the following tasks have been accomplished: the design of the crystallizer has been developed, which enables to produce semi-finished products with longer length; the technological parameters of the new casting method has been optimized; the structure and properties of manufactured products are studied. The results of research of metal products from the known aluminum alloy AD1, obtained by the method of continuous horizontal casting, combined with deformation of the melt, are presented. The scheme of the crystallizer with movable walls developed at the Institute of Engineering Science and Metallurgy is presented.

The St. Anthony Falls Laboratory: 80 Years of Progress Part 2A Transition to Environmental Research,"This second of three parts of the history of the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory (SAFL) at the University of Minnesota documents the transition to increased emphasis on environmental research. SAFL methodology includes laboratory experimentation and field observations, physical model studies and numerical simulations, and stochastic data analysis. Much of the research at SAFL has been connected to hydraulic structures, renewable energy, protection of the environment, and geophysical fluid dynamics. From its beginning in 1938, SAFL has been an interdisciplinary science and engineering research and educational facility with a strong grounding in fluid mechanics. Starting in the 1960s and 1970s, when awareness and legislation of environmental impacts of human activities grew dramatically, SAFL's research expanded significantly into areas connecting fluid mechanics with the chemistry and biology of aquatic environments, and into geophysical (earth-surface) processes. Environmental research at SAFL began with water resources engineering and riverine sediment transport. After developing and applying techniques of physical model studies for hydraulic structures and high-speed marine propulsion, SAFL researchers developed numerical flow and water quality simulation models for the protection of aquatic environments. Studies on the influence of fluid flow on pollutant transport and the growth and behavior of organisms were initiated. Geophysical processes became a centerpiece of SAFL research with the creation of the National Center for Earthsurface Dynamics (NCED), which got a home at SAFL in 2002. Fluid flow in the human body has been studied in co-operation with medical professionals. Field-scale experimentation was added for environmental and geophysical studies. Sophisticated experimental facilities and data acquisition and simulation tools have been developed by SAFL researchers. Examples of environmental research and design studies that have been conducted at SAFL since its opening in 1938 will be presented in nine major research categories: urban storm water runoff and water quality; environmental transport and mixing; water quality dynamics and modeling; global climate change effects; protection of fish and fish habitat; eco-and bio-fluid mechanics; watershed eco-hydrology and the Outdoor Stream Lab; sediment transport, earth surface dynamics, and the NCED legacy; and innovations in instrumentation and data acquisition. Examples will showcase the evolution and significance of environmental research at SAFL. The outlook for environmental research at SAFL and its connection to renewable energy will be presented in Part 3 of the presentation.",Stefan H.; Ellis C.; Gulliver J.; Hondzo M.; Paola C.; Marr J.; Hill K.; Guala M.; Ebtehaj A.; Voller V.; Erickson A.; Kozarek J.; Hansen A.,Conference Proceeding,"World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2018: International Perspectives, History and Heritage, Emerging Technologies, and Student Papers - Selected Papers from the World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2018",2018-01-01,College of Science and Engineering,
Innovation management in schools: Barriers and enablers to making as educative practice,"This paper explores the use of maker technologies as activities embedded in a wider educational ecosystem. Innovations are generally described as the exploitation of new ideas; hence novel technologies and processes need to be adopted by the relevant user groups. The paper starts with a conceptual overview of maker technologies, innovation types and highlights the special situation of educational quasi-markets, where innovation management is different to fully competitive markets, such as the hardware and software industry. At the core of the paper are teachers' perceptions of barriers and enablers to using novel technologies. Assuming a systemic perspective on innovations, the paper also discusses topics such as appropriate funding, national regulations, curricular flexibility, technologies ready to use and adequate training opportunities for teachers. Hence, first findings of a research project on making and innovation management in schools are presented on the basis of 25 interviews from nine European countries.",Voigt C.; Hofer M.; Schön S.,Conference Proceeding,MKWI 2018 - Multikonferenz Wirtschaftsinformatik,2018-01-01,"Centre for Social Innovation, Technology and Knowledge;Innovationsmanagement-iLab",3d-printing ;  Education ;  Innovation management ;  Making ;  Schools
Research on biomimetic models and nanomechanical behaviour of membranous wings of Chinese bee apis cerana cerana fabricius,"The structures combining the veins and membranes of membranous wings of the Chinese bee Apis cerana cerana Fabricius into a whole have excellent load-resisting capacity. The membranous wings of Chinese bees were taken as research objects and the mechanical properties of a biomimetic model of membranous wings as targets. In order to understand and learn from the biosystem and then make technical innovation, the membranous wings of Chinese bees were simulated and analysed with reverse engineering and finite element method. The deformations and stress states of the finite element model of membranous wings were researched under the concentrated force, uniform load, and torque. It was found that the whole model deforms evenly and there are no unusual deformations arising. The displacements and deformations are small and transform uniformly. It was indicated that the veins and membranes combine well into a whole to transmit loads effectively, which illustrates the membranous wings of Chinese bees having excellent integral mechanical behaviour and structure stiffness. The realization of structure models of the membranous wings of Chinese bees and analysis of the relativity of structures and performances or functions will provide an inspiration for designing biomimetic thin-film materials with superior load-bearing capacity.",Zhao Y.; Wang D.; Tong J.; Sun J.; Zhang J.,Journal,Applied Bionics and Biomechanics,2018-01-01,"Henan Polytechnic University;Jilin University;United Automotive Electronic Systems Co., Ltd.",
A platform for data-driven self-consulting to enable business transformation and technology innovation,"Digital transformation has long since become an important topic not only for large companies but also for SMEs.

Integrated faades as a Product-Service System -Business process innovation to accelerate integral product implementation,"The Circular Economy (CE) attempts to realign business incentives, across all fields of human industry, to support the preservation of raw materials within closed economic loops. Within this conceptual frame. Product-Service Systems (PSS) combine the use of tangible products such as building technologies, with intangible maintenance and monitoring services, to enhance the delivery of valuable performance while limiting the use of materials and other finite resources. This paper explores the potential for the application of CE and PSS organisation principles in the delivery of Faades-as-a-Service. It explores how the benefits brought about by this way of thinking - lower initial capital requirements, material ownership retention by suppliers, and long-term interdisciplinary collaboration - could lead to a more efficient faade construction industry, while accelerating the rate and depth of building energy renovations. Within the current process for designing, manufacturing, and operating faades there is a gap between supply-side discoveries and demand-side needs, which hinders the implementation of resource-efficient faades. Faade-leasing as a form of product-service system keeps suppliers committed, throughout the building's service-life, to safeguard optimum performance in operation, while actively stimulating clients to adopt innovative technical solutions. The paper elaborates on both supply-side faade innovations and the demand-side conditions necessary to implement such business models, and also explores the costs and benefits of product-service systems as new collaboration models to align supply and demand incentives. It builds upon the research project 'Faade leasing"" (Azcarate-Aguerre. J.F. 2014) and combines knowledge about faade design and engineering (supply-side approach) with the knowledge about client needs, performance criteria, and willingness to pay (demand-side approach). The research methodology includes a literature review and expert interviews, integrating both theory and practice. This paper argues that a Product-Service System approach to faade design, construction, operation, and renovation could accelerate the rate and depth of building energy renovations. It could also provide incentives to supply- and demand-side stakeholders, to implement Circular Economy principles through new models of product ownership, service contracting, and performance delivery. It aims at establishing the general conceptual frame of a Product-Service System for leasable faades, setting the basic parameters to be taken into account when designing a PSS-based business model, and formulating its value proposition.",Azcárate-Aguerre J.; Den Heijer A.; Klein T.,Journal,Journal of Facade Design and Engineering,2018-01-01,"Faculteit Bouwkunde van de TU Delft;Afdeling Management in the Built Environment, TU Delft",Circular economy ;  Faade-as-a-service ;  Integrated faades ;  Leasing ;  Product-service systems (PSS) ;  Resource-efficient innovation
Towards a flexible innovation process model assuring quality and customer needs,"Successful innovation projects require an adequate innovation management capability in organisations. This means a sufficiently rigorous, continuous, and goal-oriented management of innovation processes. The literature research demonstrates that an integrated innovation methodology requires highly qualitative processes that are both flexible and customer-specific in their design. This work focuses on the FuGle® innovation process model, which is applied at the Industrial Engineering Department of Stellenbosch University. The enhanced FuGle® innovation process model presents flexible processes that are supported by methods and techniques that guide the user to drive innovation projects.

The Establishment of Isolation and Transient Transformation Methods of Protoplasts of Vernicia fordii Mesophyll Cells,"Objective: This study tries to explore the optimal conditions of separation of mesophyll cell protoplasts of Vernicia fordii and to establish its genetic transformation system, making it possible to study gene functions of V.fordii in vivo. Method: This research firstly obtained mesophyll cell protoplasts of V. fordii through enzyme hydrolysis method using mature leaves and test tube plantlet leaves respectively. Gene transformation method of V. fordii protoplast mediated by PEG was established with protoplast receptor system. Result: Protoplast isolation revealed that the most significant effect on the yield and activity of protoplast was enzymatic hydrolysis time followed by the concentration of cellulase. The concentrations of macerozyme and mannitol showed less influence on the yield and activity of protoplast. The optimal conditions for the isolation of protoplasts from mature leaves were 1.5% cellulase concentration, 1% macerozyme concentration, 0.6 mol·L-1 mannitol concentration and 12 hours of enzymolysis. The optimal conditions for the isolation of protoplasts from young leaves of plants propagated by tissue culture were 2% cellulase concentration, 1% macerozyme concentration, 0.7 mol·L-1 mannitol concentration and 6 hours of enzymolysis. In order to establish transient transformation system of V. fordii protoplast, this research transformed Arobidopsis thaliana MGT6 gene into V. fordii protoplast using PEG-mediated method. The result showed that MGT6 was located in the plasma membrane of protoplast, indicating that gene transformation method of V. fordii protoplast can successfully introduce exogenous genes into protoplasts and make it express. Conclusion: This research established isolation and transient transformation methods of protoplasts of V. fordii mesophyll cells obtained from mature leaves and young leaves of plants propagated by tissue culture, respectively. Considering the convenience of sampling materials and the influence on the subsequent protoplast culture, we suggest that young leaves of tissue-cultured plants should be used to isolate protoplasts with conditions of 2% cellulase concentration, 1% macerozyme concentration, 0.7 mol·L-1 mannitol concentration and 6 hours of enzymolysis. On the basis of isolation of mesophyll cell protoplasts of V. fordii, the PEG-mediated genetic transformation method used in this study can be used to efficiently introduce exogenous genes into protoplasts with successful expression. In summary, the results not only promote the development of the basic researches on V. fordii, but also have important significance in germplasm innovation through cell fusion and gene engineering.",Gu Z.; Yang R.; Chen H.,Journal,Linye Kexue/Scientia Silvae Sinicae,2018-01-01,Central South University of Forestry and Technology,Genetic transformation ;  Protoplast preparation ;  Subcellular localization ;  Vernicia fordii

Prifacounter: The innovation of traffic counter application for android OS,"In civil engineering, particularly in the field of traffic engineering, it was possible to measure traffic performance by way of surveying the traffic flow, velocity, and density. The current traffic survey is commonly conducted by surveyor who manually calculates the movement of mode of transportation using traffic counter and survey form. Such method was definitely way too costly and time consuming in rendering the traffic data. Therefore, this study aims was to create application design products for technology retrieval and vehicle traffic count calculations, as well as traffic behavior analysis. This research was used Research and Development (R & D) method. The data accuracy was maintained through check and control to make sure that the inputted data were precisely the same with the results of the display on the application. This application called PRIFACOUNTER that can be operated personally in android OS hand phone. On the basis of the research, it was revealed that some variables and steps in the application concept were definitely needed to determine traffic behavior consisting of traffic flow, capacity, and degree of saturation.

Effects of medical device regulations on the development of stand-alone medical software: A pilot study,"Background: Medical device regulations which aim to ensure safety standards do not only apply to hardware devices but also to standalone medical software, e.g. mobile apps. Objectives: To explore the effects of these regulations on the development and distribution of medical standalone software. Methods: We invited a convenience sample of 130 domain experts to participate in an online survey about the impact of current regulations on the development and distribution of medical standalone software. Results: 21 respondents completed the questionnaire. Participants reported slight positive effects on usability, reliability, and data security of their products, whereas the ability to modify already deployed software and customization by end users were negatively impacted. The additional time and costs needed to go through the regulatory process were perceived as the greatest obstacles in developing and distributing medical software. Conclusion: Further research is needed to compare positive effects on software quality with negative impacts on market access and innovation. Strategies for avoiding overregulation while still ensuring safety standards need to be devised.",Blagec K.; Jungwirth D.; Haluza D.; Samwald M.,Book Series,Studies in Health Technology and Informatics,2018-01-01,Medizinische Universität Wien Zentrum für Public Health;Medizinische Universität Wien,Clinical Decision Support Systems ;  Medical Device Regulations ;  Patient Safety
Innovation and lean production,"Production has undergone historically through different changes, the essence of which is innovation. Innovations are either the introduction of new and more powerful machines and technologies, or just tiny, but everyday changes called Kaizen. The article focuses on the implementation of this second group of rationalization changes. 90 enterprises were surveyed and the results were evaluated mainly in terms of their size (small, medium, large), industry (engineering, electro-technical production, production of food, production of products for domestic use), and ownership of the company and by the importance in the supply chain. Regardless their size, the enterprises expect to continue the current trend with increasing demand and therefore they expect to expand the production employing more workers. New technology is supposed to be implemented to a lesser extent, but the situation is significantly better for the enterprises with a foreign owner. In small enterprises there is usually the absence of standards, which is a prerequisite for successful planning. Tailor-made production according to individual customer requirements exists mostly in greater enterprises. Regarding different types of waste reduction, defects are reported to be the most important issue, followed by motion, over-production and waiting. The research of 90 enterprises shoved, that most of them are not getting ready in a particular way for the future, although it might not be as favourable as it is now. Enterprises should increase the share of products with higher added value.",Vaněček D.; Pech M.; Rost M.,Journal,Acta Universitatis Agriculturae et Silviculturae Mendelianae Brunensis,2018-01-01,Ekonomická Fakulta,Innovation ;  Kaizen ;  Lean production ;  MUDA ;  Planning ;  Standardization

Implementing a bim collaborative workflow in the UK construction market,"BIM Level 2, as defined by the UK government, sets out processes and standards that formalise and regulate the collaborative methods for producing, sharing and exchanging information during different stages of any construction project. For overseas organisations that are looking to invest in the UK construction market, they will most certainly need to consider developing their understanding and ability related to BIM in order to enable developing their capability and competency to compete. This paper presents a case study that focuses on the implementation of collaborative based BIM workflow at a large Chinese engineering and construction organisation, which has recently established operations in the UK. The BIM implementation has been achieved under a Knowledge Exchange Partnership framework between the organisation and an academic institution in the UK. The main aim for this partnership project was to transform the organisation’s traditional workflow to achieve a BIM based collaborative workflow, and to comply with BIM Level 2 requirements. The case study has been achieved by adopting an action research methodology, whereby the project affiliate was an active part of the implementation project and was managing and coordinating the partnership project between the organisation and academic partner. Results to date from the project will be documented in this paper. This includes highlighting key challenges, adopted strategies and tactics to overcome the obstacles, pockets of improvements and potential areas for future development.",Alazmeh N.; Underwood J.; Coates P.,Journal,International Journal of Sustainable Development and Planning,2018-01-01,University of Salford,Building information modelling ;  Collaboration ;  Communication ;  Information exchange ;  Innovation ;  Process

Industry 4.0 – organizing routines or innovations?,"Purpose: The rise of new information and communication technologies forms the cornerstone for the future development of work. The term Industry 4.0 refers to the vision of a fourth industrial revolution that is based on a network of autonomous, self-controlling, self-configuring, knowledge-based, sensor-based and spatially distributed production resources. All in all, different forms of the application of the Industry 4.0 concept can be observed, ranging from autonomous logistic transport systems drawn upon the idea of swarm intelligence to smart knowledge management systems. This paper aims to develop a theoretical framework to analyze different applications of Industry 4.0 on an organizing continuum. The general research questions are: What forms of organizing digitalized work lead to the reproduction of routines, and what forms foster innovation within Industry 4.0? The authors thus analyze the consequences of different forms of organizing work on workers’ perceptions and the results of the working process. Design/methodology/approach: This paper provides case studies for different stages of the organizing continuum in the context of Industry 4.0. The cases and a further analysis of all 295 funded projects are based on the Platform Industry 4.0 Map, which is part of the Industry 4.0 initiative of the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy and the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. The consequences for people acting in such organizational and digitally supported structures are discussed. Findings: A variety of applications of Industry 4.0 can be found. These applications mainly vary in the dimensions of the degree of formalization, the location of control authority, the location of knowledge and the degree of professionalization. At the right side of the organizing continuum, the digitalization organizes a work environment that supports highly qualified humans. They have broad leeway and a high degree of autonomy to design and create innovative forms of digitalization for tomorrow. At the left side of the organizing continuum, Industry 4.0 structures a work environment with narrow leeway, a low degree of autonomy and a top-down structure of control authority predetermined by digital applications. In this case, employees fill the gaps the machines cannot handle. Research limitations/implications: As the paper focuses on Industry 4.0 developments in Germany, the comparability with regard to other countries is limited. Moreover, the methodological approach is explorative, and broader quantitative verification is required. Specifically, future research could include quantitative methods to investigate the employees’ perspective on Industry 4.0. A comparison of Industry 4.0 applications in different countries would be another interesting option for further research. Practical implications: This paper shows that applications of Industry 4.0 are currently at a very early stage of development and momentarily organize more routines than innovations. From a practical point of view, professional vocational and academic training will be a key factor for the successful implementation of digitalization in future. A joint venture of industry and educational institutions could be a suitable way to meet the growing demand for qualified employees from the middle to the right-hand of the organizing continuum in the context of Industry 4.0. Social implications: Industry 4.0 is designed by men, and therefore, humans are responsible for whether the future work situation will be perceived as supportive or as an alienated routine. Therefore, designers of Industry 4.0, as well as politicians and scientists, absolutely must take the underlying outcomes of digitalized work into account and must jointly find socially acceptable solutions. Originality/value: This paper provides a promising avenue for future research on Industry 4.0 by analyzing the underlying organizational structures of digital systems and their consequences for employees. Moreover, the paper shows how Industry 4.0 should be organized to simply reproduce routines or to support innovation.",Wilkesmann M.; Wilkesmann U.,Journal,VINE Journal of Information and Knowledge Management Systems,2018-01-01,Technische Universität Dortmund,Digital Taylorism ;  Digitalization ;  Digitization ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Knowledge management
Why reason matters: Connecting research on human reason to the challenges of the anthropocene,"The capacity to reason has improved the life of human beings in innumerable ways through the innovations it has wrought and the experiences it affords. Culture, art, music, literature, science, and engineering are all products of reason that enrich our collective experience and well-being. Although these benefits are intuitively apparent, a reflective analysis reveals that the same advances that better our lives also have come to threaten them. George Miller famously made this observation in his 1969 APA address, arguing that the “most urgent problems of our world today are the problems we have made for ourselves. … They are human problems whose solutions will require us to change our behavior and our social institutions” (p. 1063). This chapter aims to unpack this assertion by mapping the relations between human reason, innovation, and some of the biggest obstacles to the continued success of the human species. A review of contemporary societal and environmental problems in the context of modern reasoning research and applications of behavioural science reveals much in the way of interconnection. Reason is intimately bound to both the causes of and solutions to modern risks like climate change and large-scale conflict. In this chapter we argue that the empirical study of how we think, what we believe, and how we behave, and the practical application of lessons from such research, have the potential to play an important role in how we address our most threatening global problems. The study of morality, cooperation, creativity, belief formation, and how thinking relates to technology are identified as particularly pressing areas for researchers and practitioners to focus upon. It is argued that the pursuit of advancing and applying reasoning research must be elevated from an important area of psychological research to an urgent matter of global priority. In light of the strong ties between thinking, beliefs, and behaviours of relevance to large-scale challenges, the study of human reasoning and its application holds a particularly potent position in our navigation of the novel risks we now face. To survive and flourish, we must study human reason and apply what we learn to how we live our lives.",Barr N.; Pennycook G.,Book,The New Reflectionism in Cognitive Psychology: Why Reason Matters,2018-01-01,Yale University;Sheridan College Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning,

"Funding frugal innovation in global health: Philanthropy, aid, and industry","Fail early, fail often, and fail forward. Reduce complexity. Do more with less. Frugal innovation. Frugal engineering. These phrases, and the ideas they encapsulate, are hot topics that may have begun life as mantras in Silicon Valley but now span multiple arenas, including engineering, biomedicine, and global health and development. The term frugal innovation was coined by Carlos Ghosn, chairman and CEO of Renault and Nissan, in 2006, 10 years prior to the publication of this edited book. It seems he intended the term to mean how to do more with less: produce products that are good enough at a fraction of the cost, presumably through less expensive components and less costly research and development (R&D) infrastructure. The cost saving in R&D then allows for the products to sell to end consumers for less, expanding potential markets. This concept plays particularly well in the developing world. For example, in India, where the concept of frugal innovation is called jugaad, we have illustrations of the concept from Ghosn’s Renault-Nissan in the newly released Renault Kwid [1], a base-model sedan developed and made in India that sells for less than $5000, as well as General Electrics (GE) portable electrocardiogram (ECG) [2] and Manu Prakash’s origami microscope, the foldscope [3], all cheaper, more portable versions of the original products. These examples of doing more with less in the auto, medtech, and instrumentation industries are just a few; many companies have embraced the idea of frugal engineering to try to attract consumers and provide products and services in markets not previously considered profitable. But to save and improve lives in the Global South, doing more with less does not just mean making simpler, cheaper versions of existing solutions. It must mean doing what Renault-Nissan is attempting with the Kwid and Prakash with the foldscope: developing solutions with direct relevance to consumers in a particular country with mostly local materials as well as providing the ability to maintain and repair the technology with local expertise and parts. The jury is still out on how the Renault Kwid will do in India, but many of the right ingredients went into the design, development, and manufacture to give hope for success.",Neal R.,Book,Frugal Innovation in Bioengineering for the Detection of Infectious Diseases,2018-01-01,Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,Frugal innovation ;  Global Health ;  Impact assessment ;  Philanthropy
Granularity classification and extension coordination method for technology conflict in product innovation process,"To solve the problems of classification fuzzy and conflict complexity in productization innovation process, an extension method for conflict problem granularity classification and coordination was put forward. Through the element integrated operation of various technical requirements, the design ideas of technology innovation was cleared. The mechanisms of conflict problem stripping and conduction were established respectively with the granulation method, and the multi-level graining model was built based on conflict problem solution. By using the axiomatic design theory, the structuring mapping model was established for fine-grained conflict problem, which would be taken as the problem coordination evaluation index. On this Basis, the multiple granularity levels of technological innovation flow were established. Furthermore, the technology innovation product programs were generated by setting up the dynamic regulatory mechanism of key transformation step size and conduction effects. The ambient mass spectrometry ion source was taken as an example to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method.",Hong H.; Hu S.; Zhao P.; Wen L.; Chen R.; Xu T.; Cao L.,Journal,"Jisuanji Jicheng Zhizao Xitong/Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems, CIMS",2018-01-01,Ningbo University;Tsinghua University,Ambient mass spectrometry ion source ;  Conflict classification ;  Extension coordination ;  Granularity ;  Product design ;  Technology innovation
Implementing continuous adaptation to technology innovation in complex adaptive organizations,"Purpose: Most organizations integrate technology innovation through a complex, ad-hoc, top-down model of assimilation. However, a continuous and autonomous adaptation process may be more natural and improve the quality of assimilation. Organizational workers who function as “fractals” in a Complex Adaptive System (CAS) demonstrate higher quality of digital technology usage. The current study investigates whether “fractal workers” demonstrate more positive attitudes toward technology innovation, and whether these attitudes translate into quality technology usage. Design/methodology/approach: Online questionnaires were completed by a sample of 300 workers in 20 organizations that have recently introduced technology innovation. Pearson and regression analyses were used to examine the relationships between the functioning of workers as CAS fractals and their attitudes toward the innovation, and between their attitudes and the quality of technology usage. Findings: A strong positive correlation was found between functioning as CAS fractals and the attitudes toward technology innovation, and between these attitudes and the quality of technology usage. Practical implications: Increasing the autonomy of workers and encouraging them to function as CAS fractals within the organizational environment can facilitate an efficient, dynamic, and continuous process of adaptation to technology innovation. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first empirical research to study how functioning as a CAS fractal translates into attitudes toward technology innovation and to technology usage within organizations. It sheds light on the important differences between assimilation and adaptation of technology innovation.",Hasgall A.; Ahituv N.,Journal,Journal of High Technology Management Research,2018-01-01,Tel Aviv University;The Center of Academic Studies,Complex adaptive systems ;  Technology adaptation ;  Technology assimilation ;  Technology innovation
A new apparel product development framework for performance clothing industry,"New Product Development (NPD) and innovation strategies have merged in contemporary contexts to produce more commercial products in the apparel industry. Performance clothing category is evolutionary, yet current research on the principles employed in the NPD process is inadequate.

Underlying factors of management practices in czech companies,"The main purpose of the present paper is to identify the factor structure of managerial approaches. Based on a survey performed in 241 Czech companies from various sectors (e.g. mechanical engineering, construction and consumer industry) we identify six factors underlying managerial practices in these companies: Strategic management, Leadership, Partners and customers, Human resources, Process management, and Knowledge and innovation. Therefore, the empirical factor structure is partially different from the theoretical five-dimensional structure assumed in the widespread EFQM model. The present paper thus improves our understanding of the interrelations among various aspects of management in Czech companies. This better understanding can in turn lead to more informed implementation of total quality management in the firms. Understanding the structure of managerial approaches typical for Czech companies can also contribute to smoother transitions when foreign managers are appointed to run Czech firms (because the structure of managerial approaches is culture-dependent, as has been shown by former research).",Veselý J.; Veselý Š.,Journal,"Scientific Papers of the University of Pardubice, Series D: Faculty of Economics and Administration",2018-01-01,Brno University of Technology,EFQM ;  Factor analys ;  Managerial approaches ;  Quality management ;  Survey
"A dynamic capabilities perspective on managing technological change: A review, framework and research agenda","The dynamic capabilities view has emerged as the central approach for addressing the question of how firms cope with technological change. Capturing the essence of dynamic capabilities and understanding what they are and how they actually support technological innovation and change, however, has hitherto posed an exacting challenge. This paper addresses these issues; 1) by reviewing the current state of research; 2) by investigating the role of three established theoretical lenses - ambidexterity, absorptive capacity and technology management - for dynamic capability-driven adaptation to technological change. In particular, we analyse how these three concepts unfold as dynamic capabilities and facilitate technological change through strategic managerial decision-making, resource reconfiguration and continuous learning. We subsequently propose a comprehensive framework that provides an integrative perspective on how dynamic capabilities support the management of technological change, e.g. developments toward digital transformation, new ICTs or cyber physical systems. Finally, we discuss future research directions based on the findings of our synthesis and framework.",Konlechner S.; Müller B.; Güttel W.,Journal,International Journal of Technology Management,2018-01-01,Johannes Kepler University Linz,Absorptive capacity ;  Ambidexterity ;  Dynamic capabilities ;  Literature review ;  Organisational change ;  Technological innovation ;  Technology management
Innovation and skills workers of mechanical engineer to design smart flush,"Smart Flush is an innovative product in mechanical engineering. All the skilled workers need to improve the quality of product that would be manufacture. The three objectives of this study are as follows: (i) to design automatic water level control based on electrical conductivity of the water; (ii) to improve the supply of water into the water tank as well as avoiding any accessing water; and (iii) to provide easy installation and maintenance. 5W + 1H concept are used to solve the problem. The existing water level for toilet flushing system employs mechanical method, which is commonly expose to mechanical failure. This research introduces the notion of water level controlling within the context of electrical conductivity of the water. System design integrates the electrical and electronic based water level sensing and couple with solenoids shut off valve in a wired environment. The system equipment is lower power consumption, equipment only work when the water level changes, usually is in a waiting state.

Securing the embeddedness of psychosocial diffusion indicators into the Turkish construction industry: Silence is no longer golden,"Purpose: The paper aims to investigate the employee–stakeholder engagement on business performance. A psychosocial approach was used to evaluate employees’ perception and role engagement on organisational performance, cognisant of: strategy development; leadership; fiscal acuity; employees’ skills, empowerment; supply chain relationships; external stakeholders and wider societal beneficiaries. Design/methodology/approach: This research is context-bound to the Turkish construction industry. Findings generated from literature established a set of evidenced-based priorities for further investigation. A case study approach was conducted with three large architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) organisations to define psychosocial diffusion indicators and priorities for future uptake. Findings: Initial findings on psychosocial diffusion indicators and their impact on business performance are presented through a psychosocial diffusion model. Three interconnected facets are proffered for future uptake: capability (responsiveness), capability (flexibility) and capability (competence). Research limitations/implications: Findings are exclusively bound to the sample frame in question. No attempt has been made to undertake detailed cross-analysis/correlation to support internal/external consistency, validity or reliability. Practical implications: Organisations are able to reflect on their core business strategy to appreciate how psychosocial diffusion can be operationalised. Social implications: This work impinges on social factors embedded within (and across) organisational boundaries, including the AEC supply chain. It also relates to employer/employee relationships, psychological functioning and employee well-being. Originality/value: Originality rests with the identification of construction-related psychosocial indicators. It contributes to the wider body of knowledge on embedding psychosocial indicators into organisational systems and processes, adding further insight into systems thinking and business transformation.",Goulding J.; Ezcan V.; Sutrisna M.,Journal,Journal of Financial Management of Property and Construction,2018-01-01,Curtin University;T.C.

Research advance in metabolism of effective ingredients from traditional Chinese medicines by probiotics,"The pharmacological activity of active ingredients from Chinese medicine depends greatly on the microecological environment of probiotics in the human body. After effective ingredients from traditional Chinese medicines are metabolized or biotransformed by probiotics, their metabolites can increase pharmacological activity, and can be absorbed more easily to improve the bioavailability. Therefore, the combination of Chinese medicines with probiotics is the innovation point in R&D of functional food and Chinese medicines, and also a new thinking for the modernization of Chinese medicine.This review summarizes and analyses the research progress on metabolism effects of gut microbiota on Chinese medicines components, the regulating effect of effective ingredients from Chinese medicine on intestinal probiotics, the application status of probiotics in traditional Chinese medicines, and the main problems and prospects in the research and development of Chinese medicines products with probiotic, aiming to provide theoretical guidance and practical value for the fermentation engineering of Chinese herbal medicine.",Dai C.; Li H.; He X.; Zheng F.; Zhu H.; Liu L.; Du W.,Journal,Zhongguo Zhongyao Zazhi,2018-01-01,"Chinese Academy of Forestry;Zhejiang Yalin Biological Technology Co., Ltd.",Effective ingredients ;  Functional foods ;  Metabolism ;  Pharmacological activity ;  Probiotics ;  Traditional Chinese medicine

Fostering creative young engineers in Chinese universities,"Recently, China has called for an economic shift from the concept of ''Made in China'' to ''Created in China'', which has driven growing attention on how to foster creative engineers in China. This paper will provide a literature review and analysis aiming to answer two research questions: (1) how can we combine the concepts of creativity, engineering work, engineering education, and their interactions into one theoretical framework? And (2) according to the proposed framework, what are the potential strategies we can suggest to foster creative engineers in Chinese universities? Accordingly, this paper firstly discusses a three-dimensional framework based on an analysis from a literature review involving knowledge, behavior, and culture. Secondly, we suggest a series of potential pedagogical strategies aiming to foster creative Chinese engineers by: (1) taking a social constructivist approach to creative learning; (2) developing the laboratory a place of creative work; and (3) making the university campus a creative culture. Therefore, this paper contributes to bridging creativity, engineering education, and Chinese learning culture from a systematic perspective, which also has implications for other contexts around the world, both theoretically and practically.",Chen H.; Tao T.; Zhou C.,Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2018-01-01,Northeastern University;Aalborg University,Chinese culture ;  Creativity ;  Engineering education ;  Engineering practice ;  Pedagogy innovation
Innovative solutions through innovated problems∗,"Designers are accustomed to solving problems that are provided to them; in fact, common practice in engineering is to present the problem with carefully delineated and detailed constraints required for a promising solution. As a consequence, engineers focus on creating feasible solutions rather than exploring novel perspectives on the presented problems. However, the Engineer of 2020 needs to respond with innovations for multiple and dynamic user needs, diverse users and cultures, and rapidly changing technologies. These complex demands require engineering students to learn that problems are not ''fixed'' as presented, and to build the habit of exploring alternative perspectives on the stated problem. Creative innovations in problem understanding may lead directly to more innovative solutions. While previous research has documented the ''co-evolution'' of problem and solution during the design process, the present work aims to understand how designers intentionally explore variants of problems on the way to solutions. Summaries of two empirical studies provide initial evidence about how stated problems are altered within successful solutions in open design challenges, along with evidence of problem think aloud protocols. Analysis of qualitative changes in problem perspectives reveals systematic patterns, or cognitive ''heuristics,'' and these same patterns are evident as student engineers solve problems. By exploring diverse perspectives on a stated problem, engineers can incorporate innovations into both problems and solutions during the design process. # 2018 TEMPUS Publications.",Daly S.; McKilligan S.; Studer J.; Murray C.; Seifert L.,Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2018-01-01,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor;Iowa State University",Co-evolution ;  Engineering design ;  Innovation ;  Problem exploration
Measuring the innovation self-efficacy of engineers∗,"Innovation is critical to our economic and social prosperity. Faculty and administrators have undertaken resourceintensive efforts to foster innovation in engineering education, yet we inadequately understand the impact these interventions have on individuals' judgment of their own innovation ability. This exploratory study developed a comprehensive instrument to measure an individual's self-efficacy toward innovation. Creation of the instrument began with a literature review and expert interviews with practitioners and academics specializing in engineering innovation. Subsequent tests with experts (n = 22) and students in engineering innovation (n = 681) were used to provide validity and reliability evidence for an initial set of items. The resulting Innovation Self-Efficacy Measure (ISE) consists of 29-items within 9 clusters: creativity, exploration, iteration, implementation, communication, resourcefulness, synthesis, and vision. Factor loadings revealed through exploratory factor analysis ranged between 0.715-0.899 with reliabilities ranging between a Cronbach's Alpha of 0.743-0.864.

Designing for big x: Characterizing design for major challenges∗,"This paper codifies a form of expertise that is tailored to framing and addressing the classes of complex, multifaceted, multistakeholder challenges affecting organizations and society, here termed ''major challenges''. This type of expertise tends to be elusive because of the divergent schools of thought used to characterize major challenges, the seemingly serendipitous nature of the innovations needed to respond to these challenges, and the tacit and situated nature of the design knowledge and practices required to frame and address them.Wedevelop a framework for this qualitatively distinct type of design-termed ''Design for Big X''. Our framework codifies a set of conceptual shifts in patterns of thought and action aligned with the properties of major challenges, relative to generic design practices. The framework provides new constructs for research on innovative thinking and the cultivation of talent in educational institutions and organizations working to address major challenges. # 2018 TEMPUS Publications.",Solis F.; Sinfield J.,Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2018-01-01,Purdue University,Design behavior ;  Design pattern ;  Innovation ;  Major challenge ;  Systems
Tacit and explicit knowledge management and assessment of quality performance of public R&D in emerging economies: An Indian perspective,"Purpose: The authors investigate the relationship between the structure and the functioning of scientific and technical (S&T) personnel and the quality research and development (R&D) performance output of laboratories functioning under the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), India. The purpose of this paper is to examine how rapid economic and social changes and the demand for better accountability are addressed by public R&D institutions in a specific developing economy. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use the functions performed by the S&T personnel as indicators of their tacit knowledge. The authors use data from 27 different CSIR laboratories to analyze the specific functions carried out by knowledge workers (S&T personnel) in order to gauge the internal strengths and weaknesses of individual laboratories in different functional areas. The authors use the following measures to tap the quality R&D performance of these laboratories – number of Indian patents filed and granted, number of foreign patents filed and granted, and the number of published papers figuring among the top 50 CSIR publications in specific research areas over an extended period of 11 years (2003-2004 to 2013-2014). Findings: The findings show that there is no readymade formula for identifying improvements in quality performance by a research laboratory, given a particular set of S&T worker profile in terms of the six functions defined in the study. The top-performing laboratories have excellent patent as well as publication record reinforcing the point that innovation encompasses both basic and applied research with success depending upon strategically emphasizing the different components of the innovation process. Research limitations/implications: The scope of the present research work is limited by the choice of the quality R&D performance measures adopted in the study that could be further expanded to better tap the social accountability of these public-funded institutions. In addition, inclusion of all CSIR laboratories in the study framework would add value to the study findings. The research highlights the importance of tacit knowledge management and organizational learning as central features of strategic organization development for technology practices incorporating R&D work, the support of pilot plants, experimental field stations, and engineering and design units. Practical implications: The paper has particular implications for the leadership and management of public R&D organizations and public policy formulation for innovation in an emerging developing economy context. Originality/value: This study extends the extant literature by drawing upon the role of tacit knowledge and organizational learning to inform the empirical research on managing public R&D and the innovations that result from it, in a particular emerging economy context, that is, India.",Roy S.; Mitra J.,Journal,Journal of Organizational Change Management,2018-01-01,Essex Business School;Institute of Management Technology,CSIR ;  India ;  Knowledge workers ;  Quality R&D performance output ;  Scientific and technical personnel ;  Tacit knowledge

Creativity in co-design for physical education: Comparing contributions of children and professionals,"This study is carried out within the context of a research and innovation project Co-design with Kids that aims to support teaching of broad so-called ‘21st century’ skills. In this project, design toolboxes for use within primary education are developed and studied, with real life clients and assignments. In the case described in this paper, the assignment was to create new concepts for physical education (PE). To be able to assess the value of design outcomes created in a co-design trajectory by children, we compared their design outcomes to those created in a similar design process by professionals. Six teams of children (n = 21, 11–12 years old) and three teams of professionals (n = 10, with a background in design, sports or physical education) developed concepts in separate co-creation sessions. We present a first assessment of the differences and similarities in creativity of the design outcomes of the two groups. This assessment of textual summaries shows no remarkable differences between design outcomes of children and those of professionals in terms of elaboration, originality and relevance. This indicates that children could be involved as design partners. Further research is needed to gain insight into the specific value of involving children as design partners.",Mast D.; Schipper S.; van Doorn F.; Schut A.; Gielen M.; De Vries S.,Book Series,"Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering, LNICST",2018-01-01,"Faculteit Industrieel Ontwerpen, TU Delft;The Hague University of Applied Sciences;Delft University of Technology",Children ;  Co-creation ;  Co-design ;  Physical education ;  Professionals

Situatedness and variations in student adoption of technology practices: Towards a critical techno-pedagogy,"The effective adoption of an ICT across every segment of the student population may occur where the design, implementation and supports recognize and adjust for variations in adoption practices across the student population and the situat-edness of the promoted ICT adoption. The goal of this study was to demon-strate methods to explicate variations in perceptions and meanings associated with the adoption of a technology; facilitate the segmentation of the population based upon these variations and sociodemographic variables; constitute agents' practice, within a respective segment, based upon their behaviors and beliefs; and compare these agents' adoption of a specific technological practice relative to their adoption of the critical practice of effectively selecting and using technolo-gies. Background Students emerge into a world infused with ICT where the critical technological practice of effectively selecting and using ICT affects students' participation in a network society and information economy. Education policies and practices, re-garding technology use for instruction and learning, often assume student popula-tions are homogenous in their perceptions and practices concerning a given tech-nology and do not account for how situatedness influences students' perceptions and experience with technology. Universities and faculty, while promoting an ICT, may unintentionally reproduce inequity when not attentive to the ways in which students, as socially situated actors, acquire or fail to acquire the practice of effectively adopting technological innovations. Methodology This study was an instrumental case study of the phenomenon of ICT adoption, in this instance tablet technology for academic purposes, at a public university where over 30% of students in the study self-identified as the first generation university attending student within their household. This study utilized mixed methods to identify students' perceptions regarding this ICT, using a two-phase survey (phase 1 n=652; phase 2 n=440), and then explored students' experiences and associated meanings regarding this technology through the use of photo dia-ry interviews (n=11) and focus groups (n=6,6,2). The survey items were based upon constructs found in the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Tech-nology. These constructs include determinants and moderators for behavioral intention and use behavior for user adoption of a specific ICT. Contribution This study contributed to research as follows: 1) ICT adoption from students' perspectives; 2) evidence for segments within populations based upon percep-tions and meanings associated with ICT adoption; 3) evidence for how situatedness affects adoption; 4) a practice-oriented approach that distinguishes adoption of a specific technology relative to efficacious practice of selecting and using ICT; and 5) how promoting adoption of a specific technology, given effects of situatedness and variations in segments, may help or hinder the adoption of the critical prac-tice of effectively selecting and using technology thereby affecting students' par-ticipation in modern society. This study points to ways to better understand and support segments of students based upon variations in ICT perceptions and prac-tices, differences in ICT assemblages, and dissimilar situatedness. This study advo-cates for a critical techno-pedagogy whereby students cultivate the practice of critically choosing and effectively using ICT thereby improving their agency with-in a digital society. Findings The findings from this study included 1) variations among students in percep-tions, meanings, and practices associated with the adoption of a specific technol-ogy; 2) segments of students, based upon sociodemographic variables, for whom there were similar perceptions, meanings, and practices; 3) situatedness affecting students' adoption of a given technology based upon students' available ICT as-semblage, instructional context, settings of student work, and social and cultural contexts; and, finally, 4) technology adoption as a practice, shared from teacher to students and promulgated within an educational institution, may compel some students to adopt a given technology rather than promote the critical practice of effective selection and use of ICT. Recommendations for Practitioners Universities and faculty should ascertain and accommodate segments of students who have variations in perceptions and practices associated with ICT adoption as well as differences in situatedness relative to students' available ICT assemblage, instructional contexts, and social contexts. Universities should insist on student participation in the design and implementation for prospective ICT adoptions and ensure student voice from a diverse set of students. Universities should ac-commodate variations among student segments by tuning ICT designs, imple-mentations, and supports for each segment. The methods described in this study facilitate timely discovery of student perceptions and practices as well as situated-ness of students relative to an ICT adoption. Institutions and teachers should model ICT adoption practices that foster mature student-centered ICT adoption in ways that cultivate the competent practice of effectively selecting and using ICT. Recommendation for Researchers Research on ICT adoption should consider 1) the voice of adopters, 2) segments among adopters differentiated by perceptions, practices, or sociodemographic variables, and 3) in what ways situatedness affects ICT adoption. Researchers should evaluate effectiveness of accommodations to ICT adoption initiatives where design, implementation and supports better facilitate each of the defined student segments. Impact on Society A critical techno-pedagogy understands that students' technological practices, as learned perspectives and embodied practices, affect students' participation as co-agents within socio-technical systems of education, employment and life in cur-rent and as-yet-imagined futures. A critical techno-pedagogy is mindful of the hegemonic influence of technology firms upon education; is attentive to the non-technological dimensions shaping socio-technical systems; and is aware that tech-nological practices embody and engender values, thereby reproducing inequity or inclusion. Institutions intent to adopt this or that technology must not forget the future-ready imperative of cultivating students' critical techno agency, namely, setting students on the journey of effectively selecting and using ICT in ways that realize students' participation in an information economy and networked society. Future Research Future research should explore the interplay of student learning experiences and outcomes relative to pedagogical practices as well as available ICT assemblage including devices, connectivity, and applications. Research should also explore how the interplay of agents and social practices within education effect the devel-opment of the practice of effectively selecting and using ICT.",Neufeld P.; Delcore H.,Journal,Journal of Information Technology Education: Research,2018-01-01,"California State University, Fresno",Adoption ;  Cluster ;  Equity ;  Learning ;  Ped-agogy ;  Practice ;  Segment ;  Situatedness ;  Student ;  Technology
The Value-Adding Connections Between the Management of Ecoinnovation and the Principles of Green Chemistry and Green Engineering,"In today's business world, organizations are adopting the three pillars of sustainability-profit, people, and planet-as an accounting framework for measuring their performance. The adoption of sustainability into a company's business model can be guided by the Principles of Green Chemistry and Green Engineering (GC&GE). The principles offer a set of methodologies (or a framework) to implement sustainability and can therefore have a positive impact on value creation levers that can lead to increased shareholder value. Moreover, pursuing sustainable development will require leaders and manager to acquire new core competencies such as sustainability literacy and systems thinking. Such competencies can be enhanced through an awareness of the Principles of GC&GE. The principles can help leaders and managers better manage and implement ecoinnovation and sustainable development across multiple scales. This chapter will examine the value-adding connections between the management of ecoinnovation and Principles of GC&GE. The chapter begins with a discussion of sustainability and sustainable development; then it explores the definition of ecoinnovation and the framework for managing ecoinnovation and how the Principles of GC&GE are relevant to ecoinnovation, and critically, to the management of sustainable innovation. This chapter should be of interest to civic and business leaders, department managers, innovation and sustainability officers, research and development personnel, product designers, engineers, and all others who share an interest in business sustainability.",Coish P.; McGovern E.; Zimmerman J.; Anastas P.,Book,Green Chemistry: An Inclusive Approach,2018-01-01,Sacred Heart University Fairfield;Yale University,Competitive advantage ;  Ecoinnovation ;  Environmental innovation ;  Green innovation ;  Innovation ;  Innovation management ;  Invention ;  Manager and leader core competencies ;  Principles of Green Chemistry and Green Engineering ;  Sustainable innovation ;  Sustainable literacy ;  Technological ecoinnovation ;  Value creation levers

Engineering education program promoting the profession,"Many Engineering colleges have been facing the retention issue because of difficulties and lack of knowledge about what really means being an engineer. The first 3 years are particularly intense and hard. A possible way to overcome this period is to implement a new kind of course, more enticing and dynamic, which is the idea of COPEC’s engineering education research team, to embed a course with a more interesting activity for students in the first year. Current students have access to multiple ways of learning. They make use of a range of learning sites, both physical and virtual. Currently, students are very smart users of modern technology and are well connected with the online world. They are already international. However, an international experience adds a lot to their reality. It also promotes an early picture of the profession in their minds.

"Connecting value, technological and cultural innovation","The concept and the methodology of Value Analysis (VA) has been around for more than seventy years. We are now at a stage where the we need to take VA to a new level. My research and practice has proved that there is a wild and long journey to go until we have deployed the full potential of VA and other deriving concepts and methodologies. I have enlarged the concept of value, keeping always in mind its original philosophical genesis, which provided me with a wider view of the same reality. In the same quest, I have come to the realization that value creation and innovation are the very same thing, as one does not exists without the other. After many practical applications with organizations, I have created some evaluation models that can be used to characterize value and innovation, always in some kind of related form, and to connect to existing managerial tools that can help in the first quest for efficacy. This paper introduces a new and more comprehensive understanding to professional practitioners, scholars, trainers and students, about some major concepts and applied methodologies in the discipline of Value Analysis (VA). In that regard, a revision of the literature about the concept of value will be made, in relation to the tangible and intangible dimensions of value, namely “use value” and “economic value”, and “cultural value” and “perception value”, respectively. However, more important is the presented redefinition of the current understanding of value, function, and their applications. New concepts and terminology will be introduced and explained in this paper; such as “emotional attributes” and “utility attributes”, “esteem service functions” and “use service functions”, and “soft-product cultural functions” and “hard-product technical functions”. The paper also aims at connecting value to innovation and to the processes of value creation. In this endeavor, many other managerial tools can be used to understand and to develop actions towards innovation, or value creation. Examples of those tools will be provided and demonstrated. Therefore, this paper brings a new perspective of “value” and “innovation” to professional practitioners, scholars, trainers and students in VA, VE and VM.",Fernandes M.,Conference Proceeding,SAVE 2017 Value Summit: Celebrating 70 Years of Value,2018-01-01,,Cultural Innovation ;  Intangible Value ;  Technological Innovation ;  Value
A typology of university research park strategies: What parks do and why it matters,"A growing body of research examines whether and how university research parks (URPs) enhance the performance of their tenants and foster regional innovation. As the findings in the literature are inconclusive, we argue that the URP construct requires closer conceptual examination, especially in regards to URP strategies. This paper highlights the limitations of treating URPs homogenously and theorizes how URPs’ strategies vary and arise. We develop a conceptual model, a typology, based on URP's industry specialization and development services, of four types of URP strategies. The model shows how URP strategies can vary in theoretically important ways to generate URP internal and external strategic fit.",McCarthy I.; Silvestre B.; von Nordenflycht A.; Breznitz S.,Journal,Journal of Engineering and Technology Management - JET-M,2018-01-01,Asper School of Business;Beedie School of Business;University of Toronto,Incubation ;  Innovation ;  Start-ups ;  Strategic fit ;  University research parks
Cutting forces and acoustic emission in the diamond turning of rapidly-solidified aluminium,"Ultra-high precision machining (UHPM) is used intensively in the optical industry for a wide range of products. UHPM processes fall under the nanotechnology regime. Aluminium alloy is the common material of choice for optical moulds and surfaces. Improvements in ultra-high precision machining aim to increase productivity while maintaining acceptable tool wear rates (within five microns flank wear) and desirable surface quality (within 10 nm Ra). Newly-modified grades of aluminium alloys characterised by superior physical and chemical properties produced through rapid solidification have gained considerable traction as an alternative to traditional aluminium alloys. This paper investigates the machinability of rapidly-solidified aluminium, RSA 905, by varying cutting parameters in single-point diamond turning (SPDT) and applying monitoring techniques through force measurement and acoustic emission detection to optimise the machining quality process and provide an indication of the expected tool wear. There was a direct correlation between the level of tool wear and the corresponding acoustic signals and measured forces. Acoustic signal root mean square (RMS) within 0.12 V and average force within 0.7 N signified higher wear, above five microns, and deterioration of surface roughness, above 10 nm. Single-point diamond turning requires constant monitoring and operator intervention. Quality control is usually implemented in stages and can be as often as after every pass. A baseline was established from which a defined deviation can be used to indicate a reduction in machining quality when the workpiece and tool should be inspected and possibly replaced.Grant: The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support provided by the National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa through the National Equipment Programme (NEP) and the support provided by the Technology Innovation Agency (TIA) of the Department of Science and Technology (DST) of South Africa.",Otieno T.; Abou-El-Hossein K.,Journal,Insight: Non-Destructive Testing and Condition Monitoring,2018-01-01,Nelson Mandela University;National Technical University of Ukraine “Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute”,Acoustic emission ;  Aluminium ;  Condition monitoring ;  Wear
"Federal research, development, and demonstration priorities for carbon dioxide removal in the United States","Atmospheric carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies may be critical to achieving deep decarbonization. Yet a lack of technical and commercial maturity of CDR technologies hinders potential deployment. Needs for commercialization span research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) activities, including development of new materials, reactors, and processes, and rigorous monitoring of a portfolio of demonstration projects. As a world leader in supporting science and engineering, the United States (US) can play an important role in reducing costs and clarifying the sustainable scale of CDR. To date, federal agencies have focused on voluntary or piecemeal CDR programs. Here, we present a synthesis of research and developement needs, relevant agency authority, barriers to coordination, and interventions to enhance RD&D across the federal government of the US. On the basis of agency authority and expertise, the Department of Energy, Department of Agriculture, Department of the Interior, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and National Science Foundation are most central to conducting research, funding projects, monitoring effects, and promulgating regulations. Key enablers for successful programs include embracing technological diversity and administrative efficiency, fostering agency buy-in, and achieving commercial deployment. Based on these criteria, the executive branch could effectively coordinate RD&D strategy through two complementary pathways: (1) renewing intra-agency commitment to CDR in five primary agencies, including both research and demonstration, and (2) coordinating research prioritization and outcomes across agencies, led by the Office of Science and Technology Policy and loosely based on the National Nanotechnology Initiative. Both pathways can be stimulated by executive order or Congressional mandate. Executive branch implementation can begin at any time; future Farm and Energy Bills provide legislative vehicles for enhancing programs.",Sanchez D.; Amador G.; Funk J.; MacH K.,Journal,Environmental Research Letters,2018-01-01,,carbon dioxide removal ;  innovation policy ;  negative emissions ;  research and development
"Does the national innovation system spur economic growth in Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa economies? Evidence from panel data","The question as to whether the national innovation system (NIS) plays a significant positive role in influencing economic growth has been intensely debated by academics as well as policy analysts. The main controversy, however, is the fact that the ongoing empirical evidences on the relationship between innovation and economic growth are still mixed. The aim of this paper is to provide further evidence on the relationship between the NIS and economic growth using consistent and reliable data from a sample of emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa [BRICS]). The research has a BRICS focus and constructs NIS using historical panel data set for the main variables, that is, university enrolment rate for science and engineering students, government research and development expenditure, high-tech export and the enclosure of control variables covering the period 2000Q1–2013Q4. The study employed a dynamic panel estimation technique with a view of evaluating the relative impact of the NIS on economic growth in BRICS. The results revealed that the NIS as a whole has a positive effect on economic growth in BRICS economies. An important policy implication emerging from this study is that extra efforts are needed by emerging economies to promote the development of a NIS so as to explore the potential growth-inducing effects of a well-functioning NIS. Consequently, findings from this study have offered some persuading indicators for BRICS economies to explore the development of a NIS as a potential opportunity to speed up their economic growth.",Sesay B.; Yulin Z.; Wang F.,Journal,South African Journal of Economic and Management Sciences,2018-01-01,Wuhan University of Technology,

"Innovations in carbon (IV) oxide capture and sequestration for operations, engineering and technology","Fossil fuel combustion supplies more than 85% of energy for industrial activities and thus it is the main source of greenhouse gases in the form of CO2. This is expected to remain unchanged for a long time as the world energy consumption doubles. Renewable energy is often a better option since it is environmental friendly but its technologies are not financially available for most countries. Carbon (iv)oxide capture and sequestration (CCS) is necessary for meaningful greenhouse gases reduction in the immediate future. CCS could reduce emissions by 19%. This is an important bridge between our lifestyle and an environmental friendly world. The components of CCS system include; capture (separation and compression), transport, injection and finally monitoring. Power plants which are gas and coal fired are the main source of CO2. Other candidate sources include; cement production plants, refineries, petrochemical industries, oil and gas processing firms and natural gas wells The methods of capturing CO2 are pre-combustion, post-combustion and oxy-combustion/oxy-fuel. Possible sequestration places for the captured CO2 include; geological storage, for example depleted oil and gas reservoir, enhanced oil recovery, un-minable coal seams and deep saline formations, ocean storage, mineral carbonation and algal growth. Each of the methods above have their advantages and shortcomings as discussed in the research paper. CO2 can be utilized in various ways like, conversion into renewable fuels, formic acid, syngas, methane and methanol, utilizing CO2 as a feedstock for organic and inorganic carbonates, urea and biodegradable polymers as well as non-conversion use of CO2 for example as a geothermal fluid, used in enhanced oil recovery and beverage making. The challenges of CCS are; high cost of capture transport and injection, environmental and safety, subsurface uncertainty, legal and regulatory issues. Trappings contribute to storage of CO2 in a site. They include; Structural and stratigraphic, residual, solubility, mineral trappings. In conclusion, an approach that integrates different methods of capture and storage of CO2 may be a practical solution for CCS.",Lilian S.; Konez S.,Conference Proceeding,Society of Petroleum Engineers - SPE/AAPG Africa Energy and Technology Conference 2016,2018-01-01,Kenyatta University,
A systematic mapping study on requirements engineering in software ecosystems,"Software ecosystems (SECOs) and open innovation processes have been claimed as a way forward for the software industry. A proper understanding of requirements is as important for SECOs as for more traditional ones. This article presents a mapping study on the issues of RE and quality aspects in SECOs. Our findings indicate that among the various phases or subtasks of RE, most of the SECO specific research has been accomplished on elicitation, analysis, and modeling. On the other hand, requirement selection, prioritization, verification, and traceability has attracted few published studies. Among the various quality attributes, most of the SECOs research has been performed on security, performance and testability. On the other hand, reliability, safety, maintainability, transparency, usability attracted few published studies. The article provides a review of the academic literature about SECO-related RE activities, modeling approaches, and quality attributes, positions the source publications in a taxonomy of issues and identifies gaps where there has been little research.",Vegendla A.; Duc A.; Gao S.; Sindre G.,Journal,Journal of Information Technology Research,2018-01-01,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet;Örebro Universitet,Mapping Study ;  Requirements Engineering ;  Software Ecosystem
Business model innovation from the strategic posture perspective: An exploration in manufacturing SMEs,"Purpose: This paper aims to identify the differentiated paths followed by firms to innovate in business models, among four different strategic postures and also to determine the innovation interactions between business model components, among strategic postures. The authors intend to highlight the differentiated patterns of business model innovation (BMI) in each strategic posture and provide guidance to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) managers regarding the suitable alignments of business model components when they innovate in their business model. Design/methodology/approach: The research model developed and tested in this work uses a composite model that borrows from the logic of Miles and Snow’s cycle of adaptive strategic choices as well as Demil and Lecocq’s perspective of permanent change within and between components of a business model. The authors’ model is designed first to encompass the differentiated patterns characterizing the relationships between the strategic posture of defender, prospector and analyzer profiles and the related innovation attributes of their business model components. The study was conducted with independent French manufacturing SMEs ranging from 10 to 250 employees in size and having revenues below €50m (European Commission, 2007). The analysed sample includes 169 firms from 14 sectors representative of French manufacturing SMEs. Findings: Results confirm the differentiated propensity to adopt specific BMI behaviours among strategic postures. The authors also highlight the differentiated interactions between and within BMI components. These results suggest that SMEs tend to leverage specific BMI components related to their entrepreneurial, engineering and administrative choices. Thus, firms tend to evolve in a posture-specific, path-dependent dynamic consistency in which BMI attributes interact towards a limited set of alternatives, thus anchoring the new business model into strategic choices. It has been shown that the predictability of strategy–BMI alignment is contingent on the level of fit between empirically derived strategic profile attributes and Miles and Snow’s ideal profile attributes. Research limitations/implications: This paper investigates strategy–BMI alignments without addressing such alignments from the standpoint of firm performance. Still, performance from a BMI perspective lies in the ability of the firm to sustain the dynamic consistency of its business model components by identifying the effects of change in interactions between and within components on overall BM performance. Further studies should explore dynamic consistency as a means for firms to generate and maintain performance by innovating in their business model when facing specific contingencies. The conceptual framework designed for the present research seems appropriate for conducting such an investigation on the performance implications of strategy–BMI fit. Practical implications: This research offers insights regarding manufacturing SMEs seeking guidance when changing business strategy. Indeed, by combining Miles and Snow’s configurational framework of strategic postures with Demil and Lecocq’s RCOV BM framework, the authors provide insights that can bridge the gap between intended strategy and realized strategy. The authors suggest that when realizing new strategic choices, SMEs should favour behaviours of BMI that are likely to fit the new intended strategic posture. Accordingly, the authors introduce a set of field-based BMI alignments specific to firms’ strategic posture to support the strategic management of innovation in SMEs. Originality/value: By unravelling the alignments between strategic posture and business model innovation, this work contributes to enlightening the dynamics of Miles and Snow’s adaptive cycle. Indeed, viewing Miles and Snow’s typology from the configurational perspective of BMI provides a clearer picture of the adaptive cycle through which BMI reflects the path-dependent process of the formation of the firm’s strategic posture through the transformation of its business model.",Ammar O.; Chereau P.,Journal,European Business Review,2018-01-01,Université Côte d'Azur,Adaptive cycle ;  Business model innovation ;  Innovation behaviour ;  Manufacturing SMEs ;  RCOV ;  Strategic posture

A protocol for combining fluorescent proteins with histological stains for diverse cell wall components,"Higher plant function is contingent upon the complex three-dimensional (3D) architecture of plant tissues, yet severe light scattering renders deep, 3D tissue imaging very problematic. Although efforts to ‘clear’ tissues have been ongoing for over a century, many innovations have been made in recent years. Among them, a protocol called ClearSee efficiently clears tissues and diminishes chlorophyll autofluorescence while maintaining fluorescent proteins – thereby allowing analysis of gene expression and protein localisation in cleared samples. To further increase the usefulness of this protocol, we have developed a ClearSee-based toolbox in which a number of classical histological stains for lignin, suberin and other cell wall components can be used in conjunction with fluorescent reporter lines. We found that a number of classical dyes are highly soluble in ClearSee solution, allowing the old staining protocols to be enormously simplified; these additionally have been unsuitable for co-visualisation with fluorescent markers due to harsh fixation and clearing. Consecutive staining with several dyes allows 3D co-visualisation of distinct cell wall modifications with fluorescent proteins – used as transcriptional reporters or protein localisation tools – deep within tissues. Moreover, the protocol is easily applied on hand sections of different organs. In combination with confocal microscopy, this improves image quality while decreasing the time and cost of embedding/sectioning. It thus provides a low-cost, efficient method for studying thick plant tissues which are usually cumbersome to visualise. Our ClearSee-adapted protocols significantly improve and speed up anatomical and developmental investigations in numerous plant species, and we hope they will contribute to new discoveries in many areas of plant research.",Ursache R.; Andersen T.; Marhavý P.; Geldner N.,Journal,Plant Journal,2018-01-01,Université de Lausanne (UNIL),cell wall staining ;  cellulose ;  ClearSee ;  cutin ;  fluorescent proteins ;  hand sections ;  lignin ;  suberin ;  technical advance
Protein engineering approaches in the post-genomic era,"Proteins are one of the most multifaceted macromolecules in living systems. Proteins have evolved to function under physiological conditions and, therefore, are not usually tolerant of harsh experimental and environmental conditions. The growing use of proteins in industrial processes as a greener alternative to chemical catalysts often demands constant innovation to improve their performance. Protein engineering aims to design new proteins or modify the sequence of a protein to create proteins with new or desirable functions. With the emergence of structural and functional genomics, protein engineering has been invigorated in the post-genomic era. The three-dimensional structures of proteins with known functions facilitate protein engineering approaches to design variants with desired properties. There are three major approaches of protein engineering research, namely, directed evolution, rational design, and de novo design. Rational design is an effective method of protein engineering when the threedimensional structure and mechanism of the protein is well known. In contrast, directed evolution does not require extensive information and a three-dimensional structure of the protein of interest. Instead, it involves random mutagenesis and selection to screen enzymes with desired properties. De novo design uses computational protein design algorithms to tailor synthetic proteins by using the three-dimensional structures of natural proteins and their folding rules. The present review highlights and summarizes recent protein engineering approaches, and their challenges and limitations in the post-genomic era.",Singh R.; Lee J.; Selvaraj C.; Singh R.; Li J.; Kim S.; Kalia V.,Journal,Current Protein and Peptide Science,2018-01-01,Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology India;Konkuk University;Shin Ansan University,De novo design ;  Directed evolution ;  Genomics ;  Protein engineering ;  Random mutagenesis ;  Rational design

Developing heuristic algorithms for optimisation of location-allocation of fuel-distribution network,"The aim of this paper is to determine the optimal locations for the construction of refuelling stations for vehicles in urban distribution networks including paths and intersections. The objective is to maximise the covered demands with certain number of facilities. For this purpose, mathematical modelling of location-allocation based on the maximal coverage is developed. Considering the service capacity constraint for refuelling stations is one of the innovations of this research. Changing the approach from the node-based to path-based for demands and facility location makes a new way to the location problems of this field. The proposed algorithms have been approved by solving a numerical example. The overall findings show that in the maximal covering of demands, the third heuristic algorithm is better than others based on the fewer number of determined stations.",Bagherinejad J.; Mirzaei M.,Journal,International Journal of Industrial and Systems Engineering,2018-01-01,Alzahra University,Heuristic algorithm ;  Maximal covering ;  Path-based approach ;  Refuelling location model ;  Service capacity constraint

Architectures and algorithms for building automation—An industry view,"Most of the content of this volume highlights new research developments in building automation, with an emphasis on heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) control. This research is motivated by important industry and societal imperatives for improving the energy efficiency, carbon footprint, occupant comfort, and economics of building operation. Much needs to be done and control scientists and engineers have an important role to play. In this chapter, we hope to “ground” the research. The chapter consists of two primary parts. We first discuss the systems aspect of building automation systems (BASs). State-of-the-art BASs are large, complex, distributed systems. They connect to sensors, actuators, and low-level controllers; provide interfaces for operational, engineering, and management staff; and, increasingly, interconnect with other computer systems for enterprise-level applications such as facility management, energy management, and computerized maintenance management systems. A trend we highlight is the move toward “connected” buildings—in today’s Internet-of-Things (IoT) age the BAS extends to the cloud. Interoperability is another driving force in building automation; solutions that enable building owners and operators to combine equipment and applications from different suppliers—to avoid vendor lock-in—are also discussed. The content in this part of the chapter is relevant across the buildings sector. For illustration purposes, we discuss Honeywell systems that we are familiar with, especially the Enterprise Building Integrator (EBI) platform and the Tridium Niagara framework. The penetration of modern BASs is still largely limited to medium- and large-scale commercial buildings. Few light commercial buildings have systems of this sophistication (and cost). We also outline typical building control systems in use for light commercial. This building sector represents a major opportunity for new innovation—advanced control promises huge impact on energy efficiency, for example, provided that the technology can be delivered at low cost and is easy to deploy and operate by non-control-experts. The second part of the chapter discusses recent research projects in advanced control and related technologies that we have been involved with, most of which have now matured to the point of being deployed in buildings. Results from operational installations are described where available. We believe the controls research community can benefit from being better informed about the state of the art in building automation and control, with regard to the system platform as it exists and how it is evolving as well as to the algorithmic innovations that are being explored and applied in industry. We hope that, within the limitations of our experience and understanding, the content of this chapter will serve this purpose.",Stluka P.; Parthasarathy G.; Gabel S.; Samad T.,Book Series,Advances in Industrial Control,2018-01-01,Honeywell International Inc.;University of Minnesota Twin Cities;Honeywell ACS Global Laboratories,
New and improved?,"Are new versions of products necessarily better? We analyze product innovation by a firm that engages in research and development designed to improve an existing product, the outcome of which is uncertain. If the firm adopts the innovation its modified product appears to consumers as “new and improved,” but consumers do not immediately know whether or how much the product is better. We find that new products are on average improved and therefore command a pricing premium. This induces some types to exploit the innovation signal by selling new versions that are only trivially different from their older version or that require inefficiently high upgrade costs. Nevertheless, the incentive to “show off” by introducing a new product may improve total welfare by inducing more innovation adoption and thereby mitigating the standard monopoly underinvestment problem. Firms benefit ex-ante from better consumer information about quality or from committing to not exploit their informational advantage.",Schmidbauer E.; Lubensky D.,Journal,International Journal of Industrial Organization,2018-01-01,Kelley School of Business;University of Central Florida,Asymmetric information ;  Innovation ;  Signaling

Design theory: a foundation of a new paradigm for design science and engineering,"In recent years, the works on design theory (and particularly the works of the design theory SIG of the design society) have contributed to reconstruct the science of design, comparable in its structure, foundations and impact to decision theory, optimization or game theory in their time. These works have reconstructed historical roots and the evolution of design theory, conceptualized the field at a high level of generality and uncovered theoretical foundations, in particular the logic of generativity, the “design-oriented” structures of knowledge, and the logic of design spaces. These results give the academic field of engineering design an ecology of scientific objects and models, which allows for expanding the scope of engineering education and design courses. They have contributed to a paradigm shift in the organization of R&D departments, supporting the development of new methods and processes in innovation departments, and to establishing new models for development projects. Emerging from the field of engineering design, design theory development has now a growing impact in many disciplines and academic communities.

Impact of quality management on green innovation,"Regarded as the main contributor to various environmental issues, firms face increasing pressure from various stakeholders to incorporate green management into their business practices. This study aims to provide preliminary evidence regarding the impact of corporate quality management on green innovation and the moderating role of environmental regulation on this relationship. Data on top 100 listed companies from 2008 to 2014 in China indicate that quality management exerts significant negative effects on the likelihood of implementing corporate green technology innovation and green management innovation.

Driving effect of technology innovation on energy utilization efficiency in strategic emerging industries,"Under the policy of energy saving and emission reduction, technological innovation has become the key power-driver to improve energy utilization efficiency. By using the panel data of 21 industrial segments between 2000 and 2015, this paper investigates the driving effect of technological innovation on energy-utilization efficiency in strategic emerging industries and analyzes the critical factors influencing the driving effect of technological innovation by the stochastic frontier analysis method. The empirical result shows that technological innovation between 2000 and 2015 has had a significant positive driving effect on the energy utilization efficiency of strategic emerging industries and exhibits a development trend of year-by-year steady-state growth on the whole. The greater the value of the development expenditure of new green products and the investment in environmental pollution treatment, the greater the technological efficiency; the greater the value of the transformation expenditure of energy-saving technology, the greater the technological inefficiency. Finally, the paper proposes the countermeasures and suggestions for the driving effect of technological innovation on energy utilization efficiency in strategic emerging industries. An empirical study is made to analyze the driving effect of technological innovation on energy utilization efficiency, the positive and negative factors of technological innovation are forgotten.

Graphene: A versatile platform for nanotheranostics and tissue engineering,"The sustained extensive research on graphene and its derivatives in the last decade portrayed its significance in the field of material science and carved its own niche in nanotechnology. Starting from the simple pencil, the role of graphene now extends to a lifesaver through innovations in nanomedicine specifically the early detection of abnormalities and efficient treatments. Graphene has the potential to satisfy the nanotechnological concepts of personalized and regenerative medicine for a disease-free future. The functionalization techniques ameliorate graphene for improved solubility, stability, loading capacity, etc. which makes it an ideal nanosystem for theranostic applications such as biosensing, drug delivery, gene therapy, bioimaging, phototherapy and hybrid theranostics. In addition, due to its electrically tunable surface chemistry, maximal surface-to-volume ratio, easy functionalization capacity and mechanical robustness, graphene gained enormous attention in tissue engineering specifically in cardiac, nerve, bone, skin and stem cells. This review focusses on the recent developments in graphene-based nanotheranostics and tissue engineering, which reveals the hidden potential of modern medical notions in efficiently handling the variety of abnormalities. Moreover, it raises the necessity of successful therapeutic systems to transfer from bench-to-bedside through clinical trials to enhance the current treatment scenario.",Geetha Bai R.; Ninan N.; Muthoosamy K.; Manickam S.,Journal,Progress in Materials Science,2018-01-01,The University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus;Université de Bretagne-Sud,Cancer ;  Graphene ;  Imaging ;  Nanomedicine ;  Nanotheranostics ;  Personalized ;  Regenerative medicine ;  Tissue engineering

"Leadership and the role of information for innovation, security and knowledge based management","Information management is an important factor for organizations - as important as people, capital, and technology. Research results presented in this article based on an exploratory study done by the authors in the frame of the research project at the South-West University “Neofit Rilski”, Blagoevgrad, Bulgaria in 2016 give reason to assume that creativity of managing processes is reflected not only in the ability of leaders to implement innovative situational approaches, but subordinate knowledge for the application of such approaches. We assume that the management of information becomes creative management only when it is based on relevant knowledge. The entire lifecycle of information its existence, methods of collection, classification, storage, distribution, use, etc. contains the potential for creativity and innovation serves as a knowledge tool. We argue that leadership and knowledge based management are incompatible with the uncertainty of any kind.",Peicheva D.; Milenkova V.; Manov B.; Peichev D.,Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2018-01-01,South-West University Neofit Rilski,Information uncertainty ;  Knowledge based management ;  Leadership
Taking a holistic approach in training and educating knowmads and daredevils of the 21st century,"Our world is changing rapidly. What was mainstream is rapidly being replaced by a new socio-economic order which renders our traditional teaching and learning models outdated and even obsolete. The “Millennial Generation”, who has been exposed to technology and innovation from an early age, has now started higher education programmes at different Universities. Research papers suggest that the Millennial Generation present new characteristics to previous generations, which implies that for this new generation requirements and expectations of the learning environment are different [1–4]. We believe that applying a holistic approach to training and educating in higher education with a strong emphasis on the above mentioned topics may assist universities and academic staff in adapting to the demands of a new generation. In this paper we explore what the impact is of a holistic learning model on the millennial generation.",Harkema S.; Popescu F.,Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2018-01-01,Wittenborg University of Applied Sciences;Hogeschool van Arnhem en Nijmegen,Education 3.0 ;  Holistic education ;  Millennial generation ;  Society 3.0 ;  Teaching knowmads and daredevils
Problems of education in the context of technoscience: Tradition and innovation,"The article discusses the problem of the integrative nature of scientific, technical and institutional components interaction in engineering education. The authors consider the contradiction between the impersonal technologies of mass education, individual abilities and professionalism. In the process of graduates’ preparation in the formation of the new technological system, techno-science, the role of social-humanitarian disciplines increases. Socio-humanitarian profile contributes to formation of critical and reflective thinking that is necessary for the convergence of knowledge that is in demand today. The authors distinguish between monodisciplinary and transdisciplinary organization of science and emphasize the problem of ethics in research, including, in particular, the limits of the permissible in a scientific experiment. The article shows the problem areas of ethical control in the field of NBIC-technologies and determines the need for theoretical and methodological reflection between new technologies and fundamental human values, and generating new versions of anthropogenesis. The semantic nodes between tradition and innovation, professional duty and responsibility, short-term and long-term goals, professional community and society as a whole is proposed as the basis for building the future of education. The key to this research is the model of engineering education for future seeks to consider the context of technoscience, ethics and responsibility.",Suslova T.; Ozerkin D.; Raitina M.,Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2018-01-01,Tomsk State University of Control Systems and Radioelectronics,Convergence ;  Ethics ;  Responsibility ;  Technoscience ;  Transdisciplinarity
Flipping out in Japan: Engineering the academic English classroom for innovation,"Inspired by Simon Sinek’s TED Talk, “How Great Leaders Inspire Action” (2009) and Carol Dweck’s Mindset (2006), George Couros’s book, The Innovator’s Mindset (2015) builds idea of a “flipped classroom”. Couros’s thinking resonated with an American engineer, partnering with a seasoned language teacher. The routine class, Academic English, required for all third year Electrical/Electronic Engineering students presents a context for creative improvisation. We are “flipping” the classroom. Standard Academic English is simple. Right? The true case is that is not a simple matter at all. Too much vocabulary for too long a time period is stultifying and hypnotic. A 90-minute class once each week is not the best setting, either. The problem is how to teach a substantial amount of technical vocabulary to a large number of Japanese “false beginners,” who have studied English since age twelve, yet who evidently do not wish to speak or be seen to understand spoken English. This situation led to the experimental “flipped” classroom, in which homework is done outside of the class while class time is devoted to laboratory/workshop activities in teams. The investigator roles are Professor and Language Facilitator (Principle Investigator). In this work, we set up the experiment of a new vocabulary learning strategy (VLS), “flipped classroom” combined with Middle-Up-Down2 management style and the SECI3 model of dynamic knowledge creation. Via an intensive 15-week course, students are being immersed in an international-style conference setting, where they must regularly participate in mini-poster presentations on various technical topics. Our research shows that the topic of vocabulary learning strategies (VLSs4) focused on evaluating the efficacies of existing techniques rather than creating new techniques. Furthermore, previous VLS studies largely aimed at word recall rather than on context mastery. In this study, we specifically ask if the use of e-VLS comprised of mini-poster sessions and centered on a core set of engineering vocabulary can have a significant impact on English listening and speaking skills.",Wilkinson V.; Chandler D.,Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2018-01-01,Shizuoka University,English for academic purposes (EAP) ;  English for specific purposes (ESP) ;  English vocabulary learning strategy (e-VLS) mini-poster-presentation ;  Experiential learning ;  Innovation mind-set ;  Middle-up-down management ;  Socialization-externalization-combination-internalization (SECI) ;  Task-based-language-learning (TBLL)

"Complementarity of modern management methods and tools, and its impact on economic and organizational performance of enterprises. Empirical results from polish enterprises","This paper focuses on presenting the results of research on the complementarity of modern management methods and tools, and its impact on economic and organizational performance of enterprises. As it was presented in author’s previous papers the organizational progress of enterprises and the progress in knowledge management requires a deliberate and systematic management actions. In enterprises, theoretical and practical knowledge of managers regarding modern management methods and techniques is often superficial, limited to the level of general concepts and slogans. There is a competitive gap regarding organizational innovation and knowledge management associated with not using modern management methods and tools (or failure of their implementation). In the work, the author present the theoretical model of complementarity of modern management methods and tools and sets a hypothesis that complementarity of modern management methods and their tools is leading to conditional or unconditional application of individual pairs of management methods and tools. The theoretical model and its impact on economic and organizational performance of enterprises has been verified in empirical research projects undertaken at the Faculty of Engineering Management of Poznan University of Technology from 2014, called “Determinants of implementing modern methods and techniques of management in Polish enterprises”. The empirical research surveyed 150 of enterprises represented Polish economy. There are four parts of the paper: 1. Introduction (problem statement, objective of the study, significance of the study). 2. Literature review and conceptualization of research model of complementarity of modern management methods and tools. 3.

Two sides of the same coin – how agile software development teams approach uncertainty as threats and opportunities,"Context Uncertainty affects software development projects in many ways. Capabilities to manage uncertainty can determine the success or failure of entire projects and even companies. Against failure rates of software development projects, uncertainty is often viewed in a negative light. Its relevance as enabler of learning and innovation tends to be disregarded by scholars and practitioners. Objective This study extends research that empirically investigates approaches to dealing with different types of uncertainties. Acknowledging both the possibility for negative and positive consequences of uncertainty, we aim to expand existing knowledge and contribute to improving the practices to handle uncertainty in software development. Method A multiple-case study including field observations and in-depth interviews with 42 professional software developers was performed with a sample of 11 agile software development teams from different Swiss companies. Results We detail practices employed to mitigate threats while simultaneously allowing teams to remain open to opportunities. We establish a taxonomical classification of uncertainty in software development, which extends beyond often-addressed requirements uncertainty and additionally includes uncertainty related to resource availability and task specifications. Against the background of different uncertainty types, we discuss distinct practices and four overarching principles to approach uncertainty using strategies for threat avoidance versus opportunity realization. Specifically, we find that employed practices are guided by 1) uncertainty anticipation, 2) information accrual, 3) solution inspection, and 4) role-based coordination. Conclusion We argue that approaches to dealing efficiently and effectively with uncertainty can be improved when teams distinguish between different types of uncertainty and treat them explicitly as threats versus opportunities. Whereas potential to seize opportunities is under-used, agile methods could evolve into better frameworks supporting the systematic search for innovation. We discuss the implications of our findings for agile development teams in particular and product developing organizations in general.",Dönmez D.; Grote G.,Journal,Information and Software Technology,2018-01-01,ETH Zürich,Agile software development ;  Multi-case study ;  New product development ;  Opportunity ;  Risk ;  Threat ;  Uncertainty

French engineering universities: How they deal with entrepreneurship and innovation,"Innovation and entrepreneurship, which are sometimes linked in pedagogic considerations, especially in France, are points where French education is not good enough for the time being; many attempts have been realized since 30 years to improve the skills of our graduates in this field and however these attempts were not often very fruitful. With the development of Horizon 2020, European governments try to imagine new solutions to reach their goals and it is also the case in France. The French Ministry for Education and Research has launched a call for projects named PEPITE so as to develop Innovation amongst the students and particularly amongst the engineers. Accreditation agencies also cooperate in this direction because their members think that innovation is at the heart of economic development. This chapter compares the manner that European (and more specifically Belgium ones) and French engineering higher education institutions, among them Polytech Orleans, answered to the call of Horizon 2020 and develop strategies to increase innovation and entrepreneurship in Europe.",Jolly A.; Leger C.,Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2018-01-01,Commission des Titres d'Ingénieur;CNRS Polytech Orléans,Entrepreneurship ;  Fablab ;  Innovation ;  PEPITE

"A preliminary study of human decision-making, risk attitude, and social preference on knowledge management","This study aims to introduce a knowledge management (KM) incentive system that induces both monetary and social incentives; probe into the human decision-making nature and attitude towards risks and uncertainty; elucidate the causality between agent’s KM motives at microscopic level and organizational outcomes at macroscopic level through strategic individual efforts and social interactions; and unfold the dynamic interplays between intangibles and tangibles. We firstly designed an organizational KM conceptual model with induced monetary incentives that feature: high risk high return for independent effort on innovation (creating new knowledge); low risk low return for dependent effort on imitation (acquiring shared knowledge); and a knowledge bonus which is contributed by collective cooperation and divided based on individual knowledge uniqueness level. Since risks and uncertainty are incorporated, agents have to utilize bounded rationality, psychologically reason upon equal expected utilities, and form strategies when facing two dilemmas: risk seeking vs. loss aversion and competition vs. cooperation. Secondly, we developed a gaming software and implemented the KM model in behavioral experiments to trace the endogenously evolving choices of agents under exogenous policies, capture the dynamic interactions, and observe the emergent properties at macroscopic level through iterations. On top a baseline control setting, three treatments with different interventions were carried out and compared against the baseline. With the empirical evidence obtained, the proposed KM incentive system demonstrated fairness, practicability, and effectiveness. Thirdly, we implemented the KM model into agent-based simulation for systemic prediction and optimization. Through combining the behavioral experiments and agent-based simulation. The microscopic human factors in organizational knowledge management are explored in-depth and the impact on the macroscopic organizational outcomes is revealed and elucidated.",Gu J.; Huang J.; Chen Y.,Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2018-01-01,The University of Tokyo;Japan Society for the Promotion of Science;Fudan University,Agent-based modeling ;  Competition and cooperation ;  Incentive system ;  Organizational performance ;  Risk and uncertainty
