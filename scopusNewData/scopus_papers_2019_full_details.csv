Eco-Process Innovation Performance: Production Waste Investigation through Discrete Event Simulation,"Eco-process innovation has been recognised as an effective green strategy for altering manufacturing processes so as to improve a firm's environmental performance. As many recent eco-innovation studies focusing on perceptual approach of investigating the performance indicators, new study opportunity knocked the door for new knowledge disclosure of operational approach, since it has been largely ignored. This paper aims to assess production waste improvement brought by eco-process innovation implementation in a manufacturing facility. For this purpose, the discrete event simulation approach has been applied to model and simulate the waste rate of previous state and current state of an eco-innovatively improved production line, using the real operational data. Comparison between both states of production system demonstrated a reduction of 0.14% and 0.02% in waste rate at visual mechanical inspection and final test inspection points consecutively, hence confirmed that eco-process innovation practice enabled the improvement of the environmental performance of manufacturing firm. The study is a small part of a larger research work of which the authors are developing indicators for measuring eco-process innovation performance at the firm level.",Dahan S.; Yusof S.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2019-12-30,Razak Faculty of Technology and Informatics;Universiti Malaysia Pahang Al-Sultan Abdullah,

Graph clustering in industrial networks,"The present work investigates clustering of a graph-based representation of industrial connections derived from international trade data by Hidalgo et al. (2007, The product space conditions the development of nations. Science, 317) and confirms the existence of nine industrial clusters that are reasonably consistent with expected historical patterns of diffusion of innovation and technology. This supports the notion that technological development occurs in sequential waves of innovation. The clustering method developed in this work follows conceptual ideas introduced by Pons and Latapy (2006, Computing communities in large networks using random walks. J. Graph Alg. Appl., 10, 191-218), Lambiotte and Barahona (2009, Laplacian dynamics and multiscale modular structure in networks. arXiv.org.) and other researchers-random walks can be used to assess hierarchical structures of network communities. We, however, implement these ideas differently in order to match the physics of the problem under consideration and introduce a hierarchical clustering procedure that is progressive in time and is combined with concurrent reordering of the elements. An equivalent spectral interpretation of the clustering procedure is also given and discussed in the paper.",Bouet V.; Klimenko A.,Journal,IMA Journal of Applied Mathematics (Institute of Mathematics and Its Applications),2019-12-27,The University of Queensland,diffusion of innovation and technology ;  graph clustering ;  random walk
2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Li-ion batteries: A milestone but fresh start,"On October 9, 2019, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced that the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded jointly to John B. Goodenough of University of Texas at Austin, M. Stanley Whittingham of the State University of New York at Bingham, and Akira Yoshino of Asahi Corporation of Japan for the development of lithium (Li)-ion batteries. It is a recognition for each practitioner who has contributed to the development of Li-ion batteries: proposing the fundamental working mechanism, creating the prototype in laboratory, and achieving the successful commercialization that the Nobel chemistry prize was awarded to three scientists in the field of Li-ion batteries. Moreover, it is also an encouragement for those who are still engaged in the research and development of Li-ion or next-generation batteries and devote to promoting the processes of a clean and wireless society. There is no doubt that Li-ion batteries have gradually touched every aspect of the society and accompany with us in our daily life. 50 years has passed from the firstly proposed concept to the present commercialization, which is a journey full of twists and turns. The success of Li-ion batteries from concept to commercial products with wide application is highly depended on the cooperation from multi-disciplines, multi-fields and multi-countries. The research and development of Li-ion batteries involves physics, chemistry, materials, energy, mechanics, automation, informatics, electronics, and other fields, in which the basic principle of energy storage in Li-ion batteries relies on the internal electrochemical reactions. The popularization of Li-ion batteries in our daily life requires not only the creation of original innovations from scientists, but also scale-up manufacture from engineers to form a products, the establishment of standards in industry, the design of product according to the demand of end-users, the product marketing, and other aspects, which is a system engineering. Through the continuous communications and inspirations of the researchers in Li-ion batteries, in which Nobel Prize winner, John B. Goodenough, Stanley Whittingham, and Akira Yoshino are representative, Li-ion batteries keep on advancing in the ups and downs. Li-ion batteries have revolutionized our daily life significantly towards wireless and clean style, leading to rapidly increasing demands for batteries with higher energy density and safety. However, limited by the working principle, the energy density of Li-ion batteries is approaching to the theoretical value recently and the growth rate of energy density has decreased from 7% to 2% per year. In order to further promote the development of high-energy-density and rechargeable batteries, the new working principles, systems, and methods to achieve the new energy storage devices with higher energy density, safer and faster charge are highly required. The fundamental understanding on the evolution of battery materials at the electronic, atomic, molecular and material level while working is necessary. Moreover, the integral recycling and remanufacturing of Li-ion batteries should also be taken into consideration owing to the limited resources and environmental capacity in the earth, especially when Li-ion batteries become the mainstream of energy storage systems in the future. Under such background, many new battery systems have been proposed, such as Li-sulfur batteries, Li-air batteries, sodium-ion batteries, potassium-ion batteries, magnesium-ion batteries, aluminum-ion batteries, zinc-ion batteries, and solid-state batteries. The emerging but increasing new materials provide new opportunities for the development of battery systems. It is highly expected to propose new-type energy storage devices with unique properties to satisfy the needs of energy storage equipment in the future by introducing sodium, potassium, aluminum, zinc, and other alkaline or alkaline earth metals in battery system. The breakthroughs of next-generation batteries are on the way for a wireless and non-fossil society. Next-generation batteries are in strong pursuit around the world for the breakthrough in key technologies. The emerging battery chemistries with different features can be developed for the various scenarios in practical applications. Batteries render a better life.",Zhang Q.,Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2019-12-25,Tsinghua University,2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry ;  Li-ion batteries ;  Next-generation batteries ;  Rechargeable batteries
Development characteristics and orientation of tight oil and gas in China,"Through reviewing the development history of tight oil and gas in China, summarizing theoretical understandings in exploration and development, and comparing the geological conditions and development technologies objectively in China and the United States, the progress and stage of tight oil and gas exploration and development in China have been clarified, and the future development orientation of theory and technology, process methods and development policy for tight oil and gas in China have been envisaged. In nearly a decade, relying on the exploration and development practice, science and technology research and management innovation, huge breakthroughs have been made in the exploration and development of tight oil and gas in China. The laws of formation, distribution and accumulation of tight oil and gas have been researched, the development theories such as ""multi-stage pressure drop"" and ""man-made reservoirs"" have been established, and several technology series, including enrichment regions selection, well pattern deployment, single well production and recovery factor enhancement, and low cost development, have been innovated and integrated. All those promote the rapid rise of both reserves and production of tight oil and gas. However, limited by the sedimentary environment and tectonic background, compared with North America, China's tight oil and gas reservoirs are worse in continuity, more difficult to develop and poorer in economic efficiency. Moreover, there are still some gaps in reservoir identification accuracy and fracturing technology between China and North America. In the future, boosting the rapid development of tight oil and gas, Chinese oil and gas companies should further improve the resource evaluation method, tackle key technologies such as high-precision 3D seismic interpretation, man-made reservoir, and intelligent engineering, innovate theories and technologies to enhance single well production and recovery rate, and actively endeavor to get the finance and tax subsidy on tight oil and gas.",Sun L.; Zou C.; Jia A.; Wei Y.; Zhu R.; Wu S.; Guo Z.,Journal,Shiyou Kantan Yu Kaifa/Petroleum Exploration and Development,2019-12-23,Daqing Oilfield Company Limited;Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration and Development;Heilongjiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Continental Shale Oil,Development history ;  Development orientation ;  Enhancing recovery factor ;  Man-made oil and gas reservoir ;  Theoretical and technological advancement ;  Tight oil and gas

Virtual lab for vocational education in Indonesia: A review of the literature,"One of the innovations which has a major impact on education in the era of industrial revolution 4.0 is virtual laboratory. Virtual lab accommodates practical education with all limitations that exist, like tools and materials of practical equipment in schools which isn't in line with the current technology. Although virtual laboratories have been realized as a supporting tool in learning process, their applications in vocational education have not been extensively explored yet. With the learning characteristics of the vocational which are a fairly large proportion of practical compared to theoretical activities. This paper reviews the latest developments of virtual labs to gain insight into the various virtual laboratories that may relevant to vocational education. This study used a systematic literature review of selected research papers based on relevant keywords of the virtual lab in vocational education. Insights from the papers reviewed subsequently were developed to elaborate on the use of a virtual lab to be applied in vocational education. Practical learning in vocational education with a virtual lab becomes more flexible without limited space and time. In terms of financing, the development of a virtual lab doesn't require a large amount of investment if compared with actual laboratory development. For a long period of implementation, there must be added a basic learning process before used, the user has to get experience-based learning first that emphasizes the role of active experience and student involvement. The virtual lab can be applied to practical learning in vocational education, for example in the field of mechanical engineering it can be applied in learning to maintain fuel systems on the engine, with characteristics in the form of procedural steps. The virtual lab can be applied to facilitate students in the learning process so the learning efficiency can increase significantly.",Sasongko W.; Widiastuti I.,Conference Proceeding,AIP Conference Proceedings,2019-12-18,Universitas Sebelas Maret,
"Articulating 'free, prior and informed consent' (FPIC) for engineered gene drives","Recent statements by United Nations bodies point to free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) as a potential requirement in the development of engineered gene drive applications. As a concept developed in the context of protecting Indigenous rights to self-determination in land development scenarios, FPIC would need to be extended to apply to the context of ecological editing. Without an explicit framework of application, FPIC could be interpreted as a narrowly framed process of community consultation focused on the social implications of technology, and award little formal or advisory power in decision-making to Indigenous peoples and local communities. In this paper, we argue for an articulation of FPIC that attends to issues of transparency, iterative community-scale consent, and shared power through co-development among Indigenous peoples, local communities, researchers and technology developers. In realizing a comprehensive FPIC process, researchers and developers have an opportunity to incorporate enhanced participation and social guidance mechanisms into the design, development and implementation of engineered gene drive applications.",George D.; Kuiken T.; Delborne J.,Journal,Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,2019-12-18,NC State University,Community engagement ;  Convention on Biological Diversity ;  Indigenous peoples ;  Public engagement ;  Responsible research and innovation ;  Synthetic biology

What biological evolution teaches about sustainable engineering innovation,"The objective of this paper is to provide a better understanding of the dynamics of engineering innovation by building a novel, extensive metaphor between engineering innovation and biological evolution. In a metaphor, a phrase literally denoting one kind of idea is used in place of another in order to suggest an analogy between them. In this metaphor, the insights gleaned from biological evolution were applied to engineering innovation. Biological evolution and engineering innovation are similar in that both exhibit creative destruction as evidenced by Darwin and Schumpeter. In the research analyses, special attention is given to the current multipolar world, with the poles consisting of societies based on different cultural traditions and to the emerging renaissance of decentralized production and its current iteration, Co-Engaging Production. The metaphor used in this paper challenges and even contradicts conventionally explicit and embedded beliefs in six ways. First, the dominance of Occidental science and engineering cannot be expected to last indefinitely. Second, the current dominance of Occidental science and engineering can have detrimental effects on engineering innovation. Third, free trade leads to inefficiency. Fourth, successful engineering innovation requires societal legitimacy and environmental conformity. Fifth, human cognition forms the basis of multipolar types of science and engineering. Sixth, past and current dominance reduces absorptive capacity in the Occidental.",Poesche J.; Shipin O.; Liu Y.; Huisingh D.; Kauranen I.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2019-12-10,"Aalto University;The University of Tennessee, Knoxville;Asian Institute of Technology Thailand;Linköpings Universitet;Vaasan Yliopisto",Biological evolution ;  Cognition ;  Engineering innovation ;  Legitimacy ;  Metaphor ;  Sustainability

Course design and teaching practice in STEAM education at distance via an interactive e-learning platform: A case study,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide some references for teachers who use KidsProgram or other graphic programming tools platform for STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) education at distance by game-based teaching. From the design of the STEAM class, teachers can know how to stimulate students’ interest in programming and cultivating their ability to innovate and solve practical problems more clearly with KidsProgram. Design/methodology/approach: This paper will explain the teaching design from ten aspects and implement it in real class to see the result. The ten aspects are situations creation, knowledge popularization, raising problems, analyzing problems, concepts introduction, interface design, logic design, self-evaluation and mutual evaluation, teacher comments and extension and innovation. With the KidsProgram platform, this paper takes “The Missile Convey,” a sub-course of “Discovery Universe” as an example. Through the situation created by the teacher, students brainstorm the dangers that the earth may encounter in the universe and then learn relevant scientific knowledge. Next, students raise and analyze problems according to the situation under the guidance of the teacher. Through the interaction with teachers, students review the programming concepts and the usage of corresponding coding blocks needed for the project, like “random number.” They need to carry out interface design and logic design for the project, and complete the project. After that, the students use the self-evaluation form and the mutual evaluation form to modify and then show and share the projects to the in front of the class. After self-evaluation and peer evaluation, the teacher will make a final summary evaluation and make some suggestions for improvement. From the students’ programming productions and the interviews with them, the teaching result can be known. Findings: With elaborate teaching design and appropriate teaching strategies, students can flexibly use multi-disciplinary knowledge of science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics to solve problems in the process of creation, which is conducive to the cultivation and improvement of students’ comprehensive quality on KidsProgram classroom, under the guidance of STEAM education. In other words, in this class, students need to use engineering thinking to plan the whole project based on the understanding of scientific principles, design interfaces with artistic ideas, use mathematical knowledge for logical operations, and gradually solve technical problems with the above knowledge or methods in a comprehensive way. Originality/value: The KidsProgram is a leading graphical programming tool platform in China in recent years. It deeply reconstructs the concept of Scratch designed by MIT. Graphic programming, a method of programming by dragging and dropping blocks containing natural languages, is different from traditional code programming. In this paper, the visualized cases in the class will be demonstrated in the “interface design” and “logic design.” This paper designs a course in STEAM education at distance via KidsProgram, hoping to provide some reference for other research on teaching of graphical programming tools.",Chen W.; Tang X.; Mou T.,Journal,Asian Association of Open Universities Journal,2019-12-05,South China Normal University,Distance education ;  Graphical programming ;  KidsProgram ;  STEAM education ;  Teaching practice
Perceived kansei and performance-based usability impact on satisfaction for web-based applications,"Kansei Engineering has been applied intensively for product design and development considering the deepest layer of customer needs, known as Kansei, which is related to emotional need or affect.

Business ecosystem modeling- the hybrid of system modeling and ecological modeling: an application of the smart grid,"Business ecosystem is popularly used to investigate a complex social system with the business perspective, and particularly contributes to the understanding of actors and their relations in the innovation research. However, the aspect of business ecosystem modeling is limited discussed in the literature, although the importance has emerged significantly in recent years due to the emphasis on cross-disciplinary research and digitalization with artificial intelligence. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework for business ecosystem modeling with the discussion of system engineering and ecological modeling. The domain of smart grid is selected to demonstrate how system engineering, especially standards and ontologies contribute to the business ecosystem modeling. The proposed framework of the business ecosystem modeling includes three parts and nine stages that combines theories from system engineering, ecology, and business ecosystem. Part I-Business ecosystem architecture development includes four stages which aims to identify a target business ecosystem and its elements (actors, roles, and interactions). Part II-Factor analysis includes two stages to identify potential changes (and the dimensions of the changes) in the ecosystem. Part III- Ecosystem simulation and reconfiguration aims to use simulations to investigate the transition of an ecosystem and the re-configurated ecosystem.

Deep structural research of the South China Sea: Progresses and directions,"The South China Sea (SCS) is the hotspot of geological scientific research and nature resource exploration and development due to the potential for enormous hydrocarbon resource development and a complex formation and evolution process. The SCS has experienced complex geological processes including continental lithospheric breakup, seafloor spreading and oceanic crust subduction, which leads debates for decades. However, there are still no clear answers regarding to the following aspects: the crustal and Moho structure, the structure of the continent-ocean transition zone, the formation and evolution process and geodynamic mechanism, and deep processes and their coupling relationships with the petroliferous basins in the SCS. Under the guidance of the “Deep-Earth” science and technology innovation strategy of the Ministry of Natural Resources, deep structural and comprehensive geological research are carried out in the SCS. Geophysical investigations such as long array-large volume deep reflection seismic, gravity, magnetism and ocean bottom seismometer are carried out. The authors proposed that joint gravity-magnetic-seismic inversion should be used to obtain deep crustal information in the SCS and construct high resolution deep structural sections in different regions of the SCS. This paper systematically interpreted the formation and evolution of the SCS and explored the coupling relationship between deep structure and evolution of Mesozoic-Cenozoic basins in the SCS.

Noise levels analysis based on sensorial perception as a strategy to boost critical thinking,"Soundscapes study as a strategy to boost critical thinking is relatively new and there is barely information about it. The main goal of this research is to emotionally involve the students with this experience to develop and enhance a critical thinking, aimed by the acoustic experimentation and the emotional interpretation. In order to achieve the goal, a study area of 3.4 km in a section of the Atoyac River in the municipality of Puebla, Mexico was defined. Noise level measurements were held in 16 strategic points of the defined area. At the same time 640 emotional inquiries were applied to people in the site to identified their perception. The inquiries have a Likert scale from 1 to 5 and have 6 categories for their perception of the place: safer, livelier, interesting, wealthier, exciting and beautiful. Finally, the student asked the people to identify the place with a color of the Lüscher scale for emotions and if they like the place, also with a Likert scale from 1 to 5. The noise levels were related to the emotional perception. The information was plotted into emotional maps where the levels of sound and emotions can be graphically and geographically noticed. Results' analysis showed that to lower noise levels there are higher beautiful coefficients. On the other hand, to higher noise levels there are higher security coefficients.

On the Training Method for the Research Ability of Graduate Students in Engineering,"Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education has been researched all around the world for years and has been proved that it needs knowledgeable and skillful design in all aspects. Many previous research focused on the combination of teaching and practicing, while neglecting the development of research ability of graduate students. So this paper discusses a systematic training method to improve the quality of research from three aspects: how teachers can do to train the research thinking for their students, what the colleges and universities can do to train the research skills for their students, and the ways for undergraduate and graduate students to improve their innovation skills in research.",Tong M.; Liu W.; Wan G.,Conference Proceeding,"TALE 2019 - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Education",2019-12-01,Tongji University,graduate students ;  research ability ;  training method ;  undergraduate students
Impact of Inverted Classroom in a Mathematics II Course for Engineering: A study using directed videos by students in Tecnologico de Monterrey,"'Inverted Classroom' or 'Flipped Classroom' is a strategy that reverses the traditional learning environment. The lessons are learned outside the classroom, and in this methodology of learning, the 'task' is done collaboratively. Students receive the theoretical content of the subjects outside of the classroom by viewing videos usually designed by the teacher; the advantage is that fewer class hours permit the teachers to design more meaningful activities and delve deeper into the course contents [1]. This research was carried out among students who were studying the subject of Mathematics II in the engineering curricula at the Tecnologico de Monterrey, Campus Santa Fe. Two groups were formed, one experimental and the other a control group. The inverted classroom strategy was used throughout the semester for the experimental group, and the classes were taught in a traditional way to the control group. In this work, we present some analyses with which we determined whether there was a statistically significant difference in student performance between the two groups, and we analyzed whether the use of the inverted classroom improved student attitudes towards the teaching/learning process compared to the control group receiving the traditional methodology. In the inverted classroom, directed videos were used as a technological strategy.",Rosas J.; Medina R.; Morales Vargas S.,Conference Proceeding,"TALE 2019 - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Education",2019-12-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,educational innovation ;  higher education ;  integral calculus ;  Inverted classroom ;  YouTube videos
Using Ensemble Decision Tree Model to Predict Student Dropout in Computing Science,"Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) professionals play a key role in the development of an economy. STEM workers are critical thinkers as they contribute immensely by driving innovations. There is a high demand for professionals in the STEM fields but there is also a shortage of human resource in these areas. One way to reduce this problem is by identifying students who are at-risk of dropping out and then intervening with focused strategies that will ensure that these students remain in same the programme till graduation. Therefore, this research aims to use a data mining classification technique to identify students who are at-risk of dropping out from their Computing Science (CS) degree programmes. The Random Forest (RF) decision tree algorithm is used to learn patterns from historical data about first-year undergraduate CS students who are enrolled in a tertiary institute in the South Pacific. A number of factors are used which comprise of students demographic information, previous education background, financial information as well as data about students' academic interaction. Feature selection is performed to determine which factors have greater influence in students' decision in dropping out. Cross-validation techniques are used to ensure that the models are not over-fitted. Two models were built using a 5fold and 10-fold cross-validation and the results were compared using several measures of model performance. The results show that the factors corresponding to students' academic performance in a first-year programming course had the greatest impact student attrition in CS.",Naseem M.; Chaudhary K.; Sharma B.; Lal A.,Conference Proceeding,"2019 IEEE Asia-Pacific Conference on Computer Science and Data Engineering, CSDE 2019",2019-12-01,University of the South Pacific,Computing Science ;  cross-validation ;  data mining ;  drop out ;  feature selection ;  STEM
Towards next-generation fiber-reinforced polymer composites: A perspective on multifunctionality,"Polymer composite materials and structures with multiscale additives have great potential applications in various fields due to their outstanding features, such as extraordinary mechanical, thermal, electrical, and other properties. Multifunctionality can be achieved by exploiting these properties for practical applications. Next-generation fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites will have significant secondary functions besides their conventional primary feature-high strength-to-weight ratio. A key concept that would enable the large-scale manufacturing and application of multifunctional FRPs is 'design for multifunctionality', which uses material design tools, such as integrated computational materials engineering (ICME), to facilitate innovations in materials. In this review, we examined recent research and studies on novel functions of FRPs and the matrices, reinforcements, and fillers that enable these functions. The functions included in the scope of this study include sensing, actuation, self-healing, heat resistance, thermal insulation/dissipation, electrical isolation/conduction, energy harvesting, electromagnetic shielding, etc. In addition, the design, modeling, and manufacturing processes of these functional FRPs were discussed. This review aims to serve as a collection of knowledge that supports the ICME of next-generation FRPs and a catalog of function enablers from the novel material developers' perspective.",Luan C.; Movva S.; Wang K.; Yao X.; Zhang C.; Wang B.,Journal,Functional Composites and Structures,2019-12-01,College of Engineering;Georgia Institute of Technology;Zhejiang University,Design for multifunctionality ;  Electrical functions ;  Fiber-reinforced polymer composites ;  Functional composite ;  Integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) ;  Mechanical functions ;  Thermal functions
small-scale dispersed green infrastructure - A fitting civil engineering solution to stormwater quality improvement?,"Stormwater quality has been researched for decades, but design innovation has stagnated. The design engineer is commonly faced with a large array of design options, each with complex mechanisms requiring specialised knowledge, often in fields that do not form part of civil engineering training. Adequately combining and establishing the necessary knowledge from these fields requires a practically valid design focus. An investigation into whether small-scale dispersed Green Infrastructure (GI) can serve as such a focus for stormwater runoff quality improvement was performed. It was found that small-scale GI application provides a dispersed and passive treatment response to the spatially diffuse nature of stormwater runoff. This technology has comparable efficiencies to other traditional stormwater structures, with the added advantage of being incorporable into existing infrastructure. It is, however, not without its share of disadvantages and knowledge gaps. Future research into many aspects ranging from data collection to implementation is warranted.",Brink I.,Journal,Journal of the South African Institution of Civil Engineering,2019-12-01,Stellenbosch University,Dispersed ;  Green infrastructure ;  Practical design focus ;  Small-scale ;  Stormwater quality
Research on product design education based on evaluation grid method,"As far as product design education is concerned, traditional classroom teaching mostly uses desktop research, simple field investigation and non-rigorous interviews as the main means, which often fails to accurately and systematically grasp users' real needs and preferences. The purpose of this study is to explore the new path of product design education, stimulate students' creativity, and ensure that the conceptual scheme designed by students accurately captures user preferences. Firstly, students are required to collect the sample data of the design object through market research and patent query, and use Evaluation Grid Method (EGM) of Miryoku Engineering to extract the attractive factors of the design object. Then, the charm evaluation of users and potential users is obtained by questionnaire survey, and the Quantification Theory Type I (QTT□) is used to analyze the questionnaire data. Finally, the correlation between the specific characteristics of the design object and the demand intention is constructed, which can be used as a reference for students to carry out design innovation. This study is helpful for students to carry out product design practice and improve the scientific and strictness of current product design education.",Lu P.; Hsiao S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - International Joint Conference on Information, Media, and Engineering, IJCIME 2019",2019-12-01,National Cheng Kung University;Xi’an Academy of Fine Arts,Design education ;  Evaluation grid method ;  Miryoku engineering ;  Product design ;  Quantification theory type I
Media development in the background of artificial intelligence,"Since the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence in 2017, Artificial Intelligence has gradually penetrated from an abstract scientific concept into various entities of our lives. The government's report on the two sessions held in March 2018 once again mentioned 'Strengthening the research and application of the new generation of Artificial Intelligence, promoting 'Internet +' in many fields such as health care, pension, education, culture, sports and so on.' Artificial Intelligence has become the infrastructure of national strategy. Nowadays, all kinds of media are developing together to spread the power of science and technology. With regard to how to explore and find a more suitable way of media convergence of 'Artificial Intelligence +' for the development of China's media, the new communication revolution represented by the Internet is reconstructing our real world, and the new technologies are creating a new social form and building a new social relationship, which puts forward a series of new requirements for the development and innovation of Chinese media. Since it is difficult for traditional theoretical and practical paradigms to solve a series of new formats, mechanisms and logic brought about by new technologies, the development and operation have become the top priority for the development of media and a problem that we need to think deeply at present.",Li Y.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - International Joint Conference on Information, Media, and Engineering, IJCIME 2019",2019-12-01,Northeast Normal University,Artificial intelligence ;  Chinese media ;  Intelligence+
An assessment of engaged social science research in nanoscale science and engineering communities,"Increased funding of nanotechnology research in the USA at the turn of the millennium was paired with a legislative commitment to and a novel societal research policy for the responsible development of nanotechnology. Innovative policy discourses at the time suggested that such work could engage a variety of publics, stakeholders, and researchers to enhance the capacity of research systems to adapt and be responsive to societal values and concerns. This article reviews one of two federally funded social science research centers-the Center for Nanotechnology in Society at Arizona State University(CNS-ASU)-to assess the merits of this form of engaged social science research in which social science contributes not only to traditional knowledge production but also to the capacity of natural science and engineering researchers and research communities for greater reflexivity and responsiveness, ultimately producing more socially robust research systems.",Radatz A.; Reinsborough M.; Fisher E.; Corley E.; Guston D.,Journal,Science and Public Policy,2019-12-01,BrisSynBio;University of the West of England;King's College London;Arizona State University,engaged social science ;  impact assessment ;  nanotechnology ;  research center ;  science and society ;  technology policy

In addition, the importance of participation of all development parties can help for manage to utilize the knowledge of science, technology and innovation to implement on an area that responds to demonstrate the potential of technology and innovation with the efficiency of readiness, including personnel, area, organization, and various sectors in production and respond to smart city development. In order to direct the development with appropriate quality index in almost all important areas such as human quality, education and public health service as well as alleviating social inequality and preserving the quality of the environment to lead a city with a complete network of systems, case study from success stories must be reviewed. This study attempted to investigate lessons learns of successful factor from 10 foreign countries. It was found that there are 5 issues to be considered, including (1) government transparency, which builds confidence for people who can review the information that have been solved; (2) establishing a board to oversee the development of smart cities, which needs to be placed in the overall operating framework; (3) creating an environment that is conducive to further innovation by creating a space for testing equipment (test-bedding) ; (4) establish laws and regulation to protect rights and personal information (cyber security); and (5) local government needs to be the pioneer of smart city development and create an attraction for each sector to participate.",Iamtrakul P.; Klaylee J.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 1st International Conference on Smart Technology and Urban Development, STUD 2019",2019-12-01,Thammasat University,Quality of life ;  Smart City ;  Urban Planning Integrated
Motivation of Entrepreneurs for Service Innovation,"This study discussed the relationship between service innovation and motivation of entrepreneurs. There is little literature that scientifically argues about what the motivations and incentives entrepreneurs have innovated new services. The case study took 'IPPUDO', a ramen chain store in Japan and abroad, and its founder, Shigemi Kawahara, to clarify the motivations and incentives that entrepreneurs try to innovate new services. As the research result, his motivation to invent service had been changed evolutionary, like he started business without any idea at first, became want to do something new, and have the ideal, 'Making Japanese ramen for the people of the world' In order to realize the philosophy, without giving up patiently, using the opportunity as a new quality that led to today's success.

Research on performance evaluation with innovation team as the main body,"scientific research in universities is an important support for the development of the country, and has always been valued by the government. As the country becomes richer and stronger, it increases the funding for scientific research in colleges and universities. But output levels are increasingly unsatisfactory. More and more corruption not only causes discontent from all sectors of society, but also hampers researchers. It requires the joint efforts of the government, the society and universities to improve the efficiency of the funds invested by the state, ensure the convenience of the work and life of the scientific research workers to the greatest extent, avoid the 'bad things' caused by the 'good intentions' of the state, and loosen the bonds for the scientific research workers. The construction of university scientific research resources performance evaluation index system (hereinafter referred to as the system) can not only provide guidance for standardizing the use of resources by scientific research teams, but also enable scientific research workers to be free to achieve more fruitful results in scientific research under the premise of 'having laws to follow'. It also provides support for regulating the use of scientific research resources and keeping scientific research corruption at a low level.

Training engineers for innovation: Pedagogical initiatives for new challenges,"The injunction to innovate which has permeated our societies in the last few decades has had a significant impact on engineers and their training. The idea of progress has since taken a back seat to the quest for innovation which saves time, space and reduces aims to short term performance objectives. However, marked by the technologism and productivism of the 20th century, the idea of innovation has also absorbed the new principles of sustainability and responsibility which have imposed themselves upon engineering research and activities in a henceforth internationalised world. It is within this context that engineer training institutions have sought to counter the injunctions to innovation and the stresses and strains that they produce. Based on three studies carried out in Europe and in several developing countries in North Africa and South East Asia, this article examines the curricula the institutions have implemented in order to observe current trends in innovation training initiatives in relation to locally-perceived expectations and requirements. We have observed that technologism and productivism, which are still very present in the principles which guide European engineer training, are in competition with the principles of low-cost engineering which satisfies user requirements and respects environmental constraints. As for the pedagogical initiatives, the phenomena of standardisation and commodification of higher education have led to the development of active learning (projects, problem-based learning, fablabs, etc.). However, studies demonstrate that pedagogical orientation depends on how innovation is conceptualised and varies according to the scale of the educational institutions. A closer examination of the concepts of innovation reveals the epistemological issues concerning the way the engineering problems have been constructed.",Lemaître D.,Journal,European Journal of Education,2019-12-01,UR Formation et Apprentissages Professionnels (Foap),

A Meta-Synthesis of Research on Absorptive Capacity Concept among Companies,"This meta-synthesis study 1 reviewed 128 papers related to the use of absorptive capacity (ACAP) concept among various companies from 2004 to 2018. Several variables used to study the ACAP do have more variations than others, such as performance, knowledge, capability, and entrepreneurial orientation. Little attention has been studied in the aspect of innovation and intellectual capital. The ACAP variables used for large companies tended to be more systematic and emphasized on long-run effect compared to SMEs. The majority studies of the ACAP concepts focused more on dependent, independent, and moderating variables. Investigating deeper on organizational size, integrating various theories (internal and external) and examining mediating factors are future directions for absorptive capacity studies. These calls would contribute to provide comprehensive understanding on the ACAP studies particularly in the context specificity of company size (i.e. small- and medium-sized enterprises versus large companies).",Indarti N.; Lukito-Budi A.; Setiawan K.,Conference Proceeding,IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management,2019-12-01,Universitas Gadjah Mada,ACAP ;  bibliometric ;  large companies ;  SMEs
Towards the Management of the Development of Product-Service Systems in Business Ecosystems - State-of-the-Art,"The mechanical engineering industry faces major challenges due to digital transformation.

Towards sustainable development: The role of R&D spillovers in innovation development,"One of the most essential strategic resources of the company is the knowledge that is used and developed within the company, creating innovations, and can be transferred among other companies, organizations, industrial sectors, and countries. The key reason for this spill over is the vulnerability of knowledge transfer channels. Knowledge is quickly transmitted through the media, scientific publications, reverse engineering, R&D cooperation, interaction between staff of various firms, companies, and organizations. In addition, knowledge cannot fully belong to the organization. R&D spillovers have a positive impact on innovation development; promote access to knowledge and its dissemination on a non-profit basis which enhances R&D cooperation between different economic entities, organizations, countries in the field of innovation diffusion. The contribution of R&D spillovers to achieving innovation development, the relationship between knowledge spillovers, innovation and R&D cooperation have been thoroughly examined. Differences between knowledge spillovers, knowledge transfers, and knowledge externalities have been identified. Types of R&D spillovers and levels of knowledge spillovers have been considered.

Dealing with project characteristics through concurrent product development by Malaysian car producer,"This research work explores and identifies the new product development (NPD) project complexity and its sources of a small-sized (low volume) car manufacturer in Malaysia. It explains the approach used by this producer to overcome the project characteristics as well. In order to understand the research topic, related literatures were reviewed and information was gathered to develop questionnaire. Later, the questionnaire was pre-tested prior to the interview sessions with relevant respondents from various functions. The feedback was used to identify and specify the source of project complexity, the types of product development projects, and the approaches adopted by the producers to vanquish project complexity. The results show that the producer defines the type of development projects and the level of project complexity according to the change contents of the vehicle and the powertrain. The car producer mitigates and eliminates project complexity and uncertainty through the adoption of concurrent engineering practices, robust planning, and co-development. However, the product radical innovation is not the factor that really affects the project complexity in the new product development effort for this Malaysian small-sized car producer.",Boejang H.; Ariff H.; Hassan M.; Esa S.,Journal,International Journal of Emerging Trends in Engineering Research,2019-12-01,Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka;Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional Sdn Bhd,And Project characteristics ;  New Product Development ;  Product-Process Complexity ;  Project Complexity ;  Uncertainty and Innovation
Incentivising innovation in the construction sector: The role of consulting contracts,"The issue of whether contracts promote innovation and sustainability is an important but overlooked aspect for achieving energy and environmental targets, as well as for creating smart and sustainable cities. In this article, based on the principle/agent problem and Holmström and Milgrom’s work on optimal contracts it is argued that the current general conditions of architectural and engineering consulting agreements in Sweden (ABK 09)—a standard type of contract often used in developer/consultant relations—may not incentivize choices that support the long-term goals of society. Furthermore, although this exploratory study specifically analyses a Swedish standard contract, the question of how contractual incentive structures can optimize real-world performance is a general one, and thus the article’s findings have general applicability. This exploratory study also points to further research into how contractual structures impact climate-neutral buildings. In this way, Swedish consultants who use ABK 09 are incentivized to include low-risk, well-proven, and widely used technologies in order to minimize risks for themselves. This study contributes to resolving this dilemma by suggesting how ABK 09 could be restructured to change the balance between incentives and risk and incentivize innovation and sustainability. As mentioned above, the current study operates at a theoretical level. It discusses six possible changes that would better align the contract with the societal goals of innovation and sustainability.",Vogel J.; Lind H.; Holm C.,Journal,Construction Economics and Building,2019-12-01,Oxford Social Sciences Division;The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH),Buildings ;  Construction sector ;  Contracts ;  Incentives for innovation ;  Institutional economics ;  Sweden
Co-design of engineered hyporheic zones to improve in-stream stormwater treatment and facilitate regulatory approval,"Green infrastructure is an increasingly popular approach to mitigate widespread degradation of urban waters from stormwater pollution. However, many stormwater best management practices (BMPs) have inconsistent water quality performance and are limited to on-site, land-based deployments. To address basin-wide pollutant loads still reaching urban streams, hyporheic zone engineering has been proposed as an in-stream treatment strategy. Recognizing that regulator and practitioner perspectives are essential for innovation in the water sector, we interviewed U.S. water management professionals about the perceived risks, opportunities, and knowledge gaps related to in-stream stormwater treatment. We used engineered hyporheic zones as a case study to understand interviewee perspectives on an emerging class of in-stream treatment technologies. Interviews revealed that many considerations for in-stream stormwater treatment are common to land-based BMPs, but in-stream BMPs have additional unique design and siting requirements. Here, we synthesize practitioner goals, their recommendations on in-stream BMP design, and open research questions related to in-stream BMPs. Many interviewees suggested pairing engineered hyporheic zones with other BMPs in a treatment train to improve in-stream treatment, while simultaneously reducing risk and cost. We discuss how treatment trains and other strategies might also help overcome regulatory hurdles for innovative stormwater treatment.",Herzog S.; Eisenstein W.; Halpin B.; Portmann A.; Fitzgerald N.; Ward A.; Higgins C.; McCray J.,Journal,Water (Switzerland),2019-12-01,"University of California, Berkeley;Indiana University Bloomington;Colorado School of Mines;Engineering Research Center for Re-inventing the Nation's Urban Water Infrastructure (ReNUWIt)",Co-design ;  Green infrastructure ;  Hyporheic ;  In-stream treatment ;  Low impact development ;  Nonpoint source pollution ;  Stormwater ;  Urban hydrology
Development characteristics and orientation of tight oil and gas in China,"Through reviewing the development history of tight oil and gas in China, summarizing theoretical understandings in exploration and development, and comparing the geological conditions and development technologies objectively in China and the United States, we clarified the progress and stage of tight oil and gas exploration and development in China, and envisaged the future development orientation of theory and technology, process methods and development policy. In nearly a decade, relying on the exploration and development practice, science and technology research and management innovation, huge breakthroughs have been made. The laws of formation, distribution and accumulation of tight oil and gas have been researched, the development theories such as “multi-stage pressure drop” and “man-made reservoirs” have been established, and several technology series have been innovated and integrated. These technology series include enrichment regions selection, well pattern deployment, single well production and recovery factor enhancement, and low cost development. As a result, both of reserves and production of tight oil and gas increase rapidly. However, limited by the sedimentary environment and tectonic background, compared with North America, China's tight oil and gas reservoirs are worse in continuity, more difficult to develop and poorer in economic efficiency. Moreover, there are still some gaps in reservoir identification accuracy and stimulating technology between China and North America. In the future, Chinese oil and gas companies should further improve the resource evaluation method, tackle key technologies such as high-precision 3D seismic interpretation, man-made reservoir, and intelligent engineering, innovate theories and technologies to enhance single well production and recovery rate, and actively endeavor to get the finance and tax subsidy on tight oil and gas.",SUN L.; ZOU C.; JIA A.; WEI Y.; ZHU R.; WU S.; GUO Z.,Journal,Petroleum Exploration and Development,2019-12-01,Daqing Oilfield Company Limited;Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration and Development;Heilongjiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Continental Shale Oil,development history ;  development orientation ;  enhancing recovery factor ;  man-made oil and gas reservoir ;  theoretical and technological advancement ;  tight oil and gas

Research profiling for responsible and sustainable innovations,"The issues of responsible and sustainable innovations have been attracting the growing attention of the ranks of scholars in recent years. However, this amassing productivity in the field has not been mapped and profiled thoroughly, yet. Therefore, the aim of the paper is to map the research output related to the concepts of responsible and sustainable innovations with the method of research profiling. The analysis consists of three components: general research profiling, subject area profiling and topic profiling conducted with the use of Scopus database. The research process is directed at answering three research questions: (1) who are the main contributors within the scholarly community? why? so what? (2) how is the research output distributed among subject areas? why? so what? (3) what are the central topics and issues discussed within the research field? why? so what? First of all, key contributing countries, research institutions, journals, and authors are identified in order to characterize the scholarly community working in the field. Secondly, research output is profiled through the prism of respective subject areas. This type of profiling aims at discovering varieties among key journals, authors and core references distributed across various subject areas. Thirdly, topic analysis is conducted in order to point out most crucial aspects studied in the body of literature in the field. The research sample consists of 1083 publications indexed in Scopus database, including the phrases 'responsible innovation' or 'sustainable innovation' within their titles, keywords, and abstracts (topic search). The findings from the general research profiling confirm the growing interest of academia in exploring and investigating the issues of responsible and sustainable innovations. The leading contributors in the field are scholars and research institutions from the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Dutch universities and research centers occupy three top three positions in regard to the number of publications. Among them, Delft University of Technology is the unquestionable leader. Journal of Cleaner Production and Journal of Responsible Innovation are found to be the most prolific and highly recognized source titles in the field. Subject area profiling shows a relatively high level of interrelatedness among the four leading subject areas i.e., Business, Management and Accounting, Engineering, Social Sciences, and Environmental Science in regard to authors, source titles and core references. Topic profiling indicates two leading thematic streams in the research field focused on the features and core aspects of responsible and sustainable innovations, and the relationships of the concept with people (human, humans), research, ethics, and technology. Discussion of research findings is focused around comparing and contrasting three overlapping concepts (i.e., responsible research and innovation, responsible innovation, and sustainable innovation), providing the critical assessment of the reasons for the scholarly research to have developed along with certain patterns and identifying unexplored aspects or possible future avenues of research.",Sudolska A.; Lis A.; Chodorek M.,Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2019-12-01,Uniwersytet Mikołaja Kopernika w Toruniu;WSB University in Toruń,Bibliometrics ;  Research profiling ;  Responsible innovation ;  Sustainable innovation

Shake-it-off: A simple ultrasonic cryo-EM specimen-preparation device Rubinstein John L.,"Although microscopes and image-analysis software for electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) have improved dramatically in recent years, specimen-preparation methods have lagged behind. Most strategies still rely on blotting microscope grids with paper to produce a thin film of solution suitable for vitrification. This approach loses more than 99.9% of the applied sample and requires several seconds, leading to problematic air-water interface interactions for macromolecules in the resulting thin film of solution and complicating time-resolved studies. Recently developed self-wicking EM grids allow the use of small volumes of sample, with nanowires on the grid bars removing excess solution to produce a thin film within tens of milliseconds from sample application to freezing. Here, a simple cryo-EM specimen-preparation device that uses components from an ultrasonic humidifier to transfer protein solution onto a self-wicking EM grid is presented. The device is controlled by a Raspberry Pi single-board computer and all components are either widely available or can be manufactured by online services, allowing the device to be constructed in laboratories that specialize in cryo-EM rather than instrument design. The simple open-source design permits the straightforward customization of the instrument for specialized experiments.",Rubinstein J.; Guo H.; Ripstein Z.; Haydaroglu A.; Au A.; Yip C.; Trani J.; Benlekbira S.; Kwoka T.,Journal,Acta Crystallographica Section D: Structural Biology,2019-12-01,"University of Toronto, Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering;SickKids Research Institute;University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine;University of Toronto",3D printing ;  CNC milling Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grant John L.

Data science-enabled molecular-to-systems engineering for sustainable water treatment,"Growing social and economic pressures demand technological innovations that enable the widespread usage of unconventional sources of water. These challenges motivate the emerging fit-for-purpose paradigm, wherein water is provided at the precise quality level of the intended application. Unfortunately, to date, fundamental advances in materials and nanotechnology have been slow to advance this paradigm. Using examples from membrane science and engineering, we highlight the critical need to bridge research at the molecular and nano-scales with development at the device and systems-scales to fully realize sustainable fit-for-purpose water technology. Specifically, we present four opportunities for computing and data science to accelerate convergence of sustainable water research: materials informatics and inverse design, model-based design of experiments, superstructure optimization, and uncertainty quantification. As such, we highlight opportunities to collaboratively revolutionize molecular-to-systems engineering of sustainable water technologies, but emphasize open communication between data scientists and water-focused researchers using a common vocabulary as a significant hurdle.",Eugene E.; Phillip W.; Dowling A.,Journal,Current Opinion in Chemical Engineering,2019-12-01,College of Engineering,
Vigilante Innovation (VIX): case study on the development of student skills through a team-based design process and environment,"Background: Many undergraduate students majoring in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields lack experience in collaborative thinking, limiting their effectiveness as they enter careers in academic and industrial environments. The SyBBURE Searle Undergraduate Research Program has incorporated a team-based design component into its curriculum to fill this gap in training. This design framework, called Vigilante Innovation (VIX) to highlight its emphasis on self-initiation and action, has evolved into a multi-semester-long group undertaking that combines just-in-time training in entrepreneurship and project design with student-driven collaborations aimed at solving a real-world problem. We hypothesize that this framework provides a hands-on, realistic workplace simulation task through which students can develop an understanding of teamwork. Results: Using a case-study approach, we discuss the development of the VIX design framework since its inception in 2014 and assess the impact of the VIX framework on student learning and growth using a student survey from 2016 to 2017 and student interviews from 2018. Conclusions: A flexible approach, an annualized project timeline, a student-driven prototyping space, and self-selecting project areas emerged as key contributors to the successful implementation of the VIX design and to deepened student learning. The diversity of VIX teams, the self-reported success of student projects, and student interviews indicate that students who participate in VIX possess an in-depth understanding of team-based strategies. These findings support the VIX framework as an effective method of providing undergraduates in STEM fields with efficient and meaningful exposure to the team-based entrepreneurial skills that are vital in their future careers. Additional work is needed to determine if this approach has a long-term impact on student success in team-based environments.

Sustainable innovative project management: Response to improve livability and quality of life: Case studies: Iran and Germany,"Nowadays, quality of life and livability are controversial phenomenon. A high quality of life and livability are demanded in cities; however, rapid and unplanned urbanization creates a lot of challenges such as poverty, slums, social instability, insecurity, diseases, environmental challenges and climate change, unemployment, economic problems, etc., which threaten the livability of the world. Therefore, it is vital to tackle urbanization challenges and create a sustainable urban setting with a high quality of life in order to make the world a better place to live. In particular, literature reviews, surveys, exploratory case studies, and the Kiwi and Kampenhood methodology based on Persian Zarathustra that is utilized in social science, engineering and management are the main method tools in this study. Fundamentally, modern livable and sustainable urban settings are suggested as a path to deal with urbanization challenges in order to improve livability and quality of life. Although sustainable cities provide opportunities to improve quality of life, urban planning and good governance with effective regulatory frameworks to create such modern settings are required. Thus, an innovative sustainable project management is introduced as a tool to design modern livable and sustainable areas.

"Responsible Innovation for Life: Five Challenges Agriculture Offers for Responsible Innovation in Agriculture and Food, and the Necessity of an Ethics of Innovation","In this special issue we will investigate, from the perspective of agricultural ethics (e.g. animal welfare, agricultural and food ethics, environmental ethics etc.) the potential to develop a Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) approach to agriculture, and the limitations to such an enterprise. RRI is an emerging field in the European research and innovation (R&I) policy context that aims to balance economic, socio-cultural and environmental aspects in innovation processes. Because technological innovations can contribute significantly to the solution of societal challenges like climate change or food security, but can also have negative societal consequences, it is assumed that social and ethical aspects should be considered during the R&I process. For this reason, the emerging concept of RRI calls for ethical reflection on the nature, scope and applicability of responsibility and innovation in innovation practices in general, and the way social–ethical issues can be applied and addressed in agriculture.",Gremmen B.; Blok V.; Bovenkerk B.,Journal,Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics,2019-12-01,Wageningen University & Research,Citizen inclusion ;  Drones ;  Ecological management ;  Gene editing ;  Responsible innovation

The burgeoning era of big data is influencing the process industries tremendously, providing unprecedented opportunities to achieve smart manufacturing. This kind of manufacturing requires machines to not only be capable of relieving humans from intensive physical work, but also be effective in taking on intellectual labor and even producing innovations on their own. To attain this goal, data analytics and machine learning are indispensable. In this paper, we review recent advances in data analytics and machine learning applied to the monitoring, control, and optimization of industrial processes, paying particular attention to the interpretability and functionality of machine learning models. By analyzing the gap between practical requirements and the current research status, promising future research directions are identified.",Shang C.; You F.,Journal,Engineering,2019-12-01,Cornell University College of Engineering;Tsinghua University,Big data ;  Machine learning ;  Process systems engineering ;  Smart manufacturing

Problematic roadmapping for companies in less developed Regions of Slovakia,"This economic research was based on the literary analysis, various empirical studies and statistical versus qualitative research in 500 problematic companies mainly in the East of Slovakia. Businesses received about 100 questions about innovation management, innovation support, strategic planning, roadmapping, risk management, etc. These statistical results were completed by the expert consultations in 2018-2019. Based on the research results, it can be concluded that these problematic companies are mainly micro-companies with up to 10 employees (mostly Ltd.), mainly in the construction, engineering, automotive, rubber, and plastic industries. These companies are dominated by piece and series production. The use of RM processes was minimal and only applied in larger companies (TR ≥ 500 000 €). The roadmapping processes have been greatly simplified and unsystematic, mainly based on the requirements of business owners or top managers.",Jemala M.,Journal,International Journal of Innovation and Technology Management,2019-12-01,University of Ss.

Progress in the development of methods used for the abatement of microbial contaminants in ethanol fermentations: a review,"Biofuel research and development roadmap is currently underway in several countries and is expected to pave a way for the establishment of a viable renewable energy sector that can compete with petroleum-based fuels. Ethanol fermentation has garnered increasing attention amongst various stakeholders (industries, governments, and academia) due to its economic and environmental merits. However, microbial contamination continues to be one of the major barriers in ethanologenic processes, resulting in low ethanol yields and thereby translating into economic losses. To this end, technological innovations geared towards effective elimination of microbial contamination are constantly being developed. This review explores and discusses the fermentation conditions that facilitate the growth of undesired microorganisms during ethanol fermentation processes. It highlights the methods that are currently used in biorefineries as well as innovative and advanced biotechnological methods currently being evaluated as viable alternative strategies to control or eliminate microbial contaminants in ethanol fermentations. These methods have the potential to minimize or control the contamination problem and could pave a way for the development of an efficient biofuel sector.",Sekoai P.; Mhlongo S.; Ezeokoli O.,Journal,Reviews in Environmental Science and Biotechnology,2019-12-01,North-West University;University of KwaZulu-Natal,Bacteriophages ;  Ethanol fermentation ;  Genetical-engineering ;  Microbial contaminants ;  Natural compounds ;  Yeast
Demand-pull innovation in science: Empirical evidence from a research university's suppliers,"The paths via which university-generated knowledge reaches final users and creates value are traditionally considered to be the supply-side channels of the commercialisation of inventions, consultancy, and R&D contracts. Yet, this focus limits universities to being “providers” of knowledge and technology for industrial applications and fails to account for the diversity of mechanisms responsible for the diffusion of academic activities. This paper aims to complete the existing understanding of the contribution made by universities to the corporate innovation process by recognising the impact of university demand on the innovative performance of firms in the scientific value chain. We study the impact of a large French public university on the innovative performance of its suppliers of scientific equipment. We perform micro-econometric analyses showing that university suppliers have a higher propensity to introduce new-to-the-market product innovations than do other firms belonging to the same sectors and with similar characteristics. Our results provide support to the conjecture that innovations and technological changes are the result not only of scientific and technical discoveries, but also of a complex chain reaction triggered by the interplay between specific demands and solutions designed to overcome technology bottlenecks.",Bianchini S.; Llerena P.; Patsali S.,Journal,Research Policy: X,2019-12-01,Scuola Universitaria Superiore IUSS di Pavia;Université de Strasbourg,Demand-pulll innovation ;  Public procurement ;  Scientific equipment ;  University-industry interactions ;  User innovation
Human Factors and User Experience Issues with Ventricular Assist Device Wearable Components: A Systematic Review,"Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs) provide continuous mechanical circulatory support during in- and out-of-hospital care. However, limitations of the external wearable components influence patient quality of life. There is insufficient understanding of the issues with such components that combines a holistic viewpoint from both human factors and user (including patient and caregiver) experience perspectives. This paper comprehensively details the issues with VAD wearable systems and proposes a way for human-centered design to bridge the gap, addressing such issues synergistically. Through the review the authors investigated: the user issues caused by wearable components of VADs, and how human factors issues correlate to the VAD user experience. A Boolean search (“ventricular assist” AND “human factors” AND “experience”) for peer-reviewed studies published between 2008 and 2018 returned 338 titles, with 35 relevant studies selected using a PRISMA process for inclusion in cross-study analysis and synthesis. This paper provides design recommendations for the issues found in the literature. Four key focus areas to inform the future design of VAD wearable components were identified—‘Power Supply’, ‘Wearability and Travel Freedom’, ‘The Female Experience’ and ‘Intuitive Handling’. Using design to drive innovation could result in VAD wearable components which better meet or exceed users’ quality of life goals.",Dunn J.; Nusem E.; Straker K.; Gregory S.; Wrigley C.,Journal,Annals of Biomedical Engineering,2019-12-01,Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute;The University of Sydney;Monash University,Caregiver experience ;  Design considerations ;  Design innovation ;  Human centered design ;  Human factors engineering ;  Mechanical circulatory support ;  Patient experience ;  Ventricular assist device ;  Wearable systems
Learning-oriented assessment in action: impact on students of physics for engineering,"Aligned with the constructivist paradigm and catalyzed by the irruption of information technologies in the teaching–learning process, interactive teaching techniques such as Flipped Learning and Self and Peer Assessment are increasingly relevant in higher education. Both strategies share the quality of empowering students with responsibility for their own learning process, which depends on the development of strategic and autonomous learning. Although each one has evolved through separate trajectories in professional practice and in research; however, in this work, their paths meet under the framework of the Learning Oriented Assessment. The convergence of these interactive techniques came to reality as an instructional design with the main objective being to enhance the students’ performance in applying concepts to solve Physics problems. To evaluate the impact of combining these techniques versus applying them separately, a research-action project was executed. A total of 157 students from Physics II courses at the Puebla campus of Tecnologico de Monterrey participated in this project. The empirical investigation showed that the group undergoing the combined techniques experienced a superior development of disciplinary competencies compared to the group where the techniques were applied individually. It was possible to verify that the best students (those with better academic performance) were better adapted to the method of Learning Oriented Assessment. The results did not show that the lower level academic students had differences in performance or level of achievement. Also, the lower achieving group perceived the method as unsuitable for their style of studying.",González Pérez O.; Trevino J.,Journal,International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing,2019-12-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Educational innovation ;  Flipped learning ;  Learning-oriented-assessment ;  Physics for engineers ;  Self-and-peer-assessment ;  Tec21 educational model
EEG acquisition and analysis to improve stochastic processes and signal processing understanding in Engineering students: refining active learning dynamics via interactive approach in teaching,"Mathematics as stochastic processes, signal processing and dynamical systems may be difficult to understand even for Engineering students. So, in order to improve assimilation of their contents, we proposed to use active learning (AL) in a novel way. AL will be linked to an electroencephalographic signals device in order to motivate students through real life situations. Before starting our research with massive groups of people, we preferred to implement a pilot study with two groups of advantaged students for 1 year. They were compared with 4 groups of students undergoing a traditional learning process (corresponding to 2 years of class; specifically, two groups per year in 2 years). Our study, in this original paper, aligns with the educational Tec21 model of Tecnologico de Monterrey in a novel and unique way by improving AL dynamics via interactive approach in teaching.",Zavala Yoé R.; Ramírez Mendoza R.,Journal,International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing,2019-12-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Active learning ;  Data acquisition ;  Educational innovation ;  Electroencephalographic signals ;  Interactive approach in teaching ;  Scientific computational analysis ;  Signal processing ;  Stochastic processes
Challenge-based learning: an I-semester for experiential learning in Mechatronics Engineering,"An Educational Innovation approach denominated, “I-semester,” for Mechatronics Engineering students was designed, implemented and evaluated. The teaching–learning concept applied herein is interactive, experiential, motivates students and encourages their creativity to provide solutions to real-world challenges. Within the frameworks of competency-based education (CBE) and challenge-based learning (CBL), learning experiences were designed consisting of educational modules and challenges focused on developing disciplinary and transversal competencies during an academic semester. The modules provided theoretical and practical knowledge, whereas challenge activities promoted the development of competencies and the generation of creative–solution proposals. This educational research effort included a formal methodology that started with a problem statement and a hypothesis, followed by the method and an experiment that consisted of the I-semester implementation with a sample of students enrolled in the Mechatronic Engineering program at Tecnologico de Monterrey. The methodology, the development of the experiment and the findings through the analysis of gathered data could contribute to educational research focused on CBE–CBL approaches in educational programs for undergraduate engineering students.",Félix-Herrán L.; Rendon-Nava A.; Nieto Jalil J.,Journal,International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing,2019-12-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Challenge-based education ;  Challenge-based learning ;  Educational innovation ;  Evaluation ;  I-semester
Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles for disease detection and therapy,"Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (MIONs) are among the first generation of nanomaterials that have advanced to clinic use. A broad range of biomedical techniques have been developed by combining the versatile nanomagnetism of MIONs with various forms of applied magnetic fields. MIONs can generate imaging contrast and provide mechanical/thermal energy in vivo in response to an external magnetic field, a special feature that distinguishes MIONs from other nanomaterials. These properties offer unique opportunities for nanomaterials engineering in biomedical research and clinical interventions. The past few decades have witnessed the evolution of the applications of MIONs from conventional drug delivery and hyperthermia to the regulation of molecular and cellular processes in the body. Here we review the most recent development in this field, including clinical studies of MIONs and the emerging techniques that may contribute to future innovation in medicine.",Tong S.; Zhu H.; Bao G.,Journal,Materials Today,2019-12-01,George R.

Learning gain study in a strategy of flipped learning in the undergraduate level,"The quest to find innovative ways to implement the teaching–learning process to provide students a significant learning environment has intensified. The inclusion of technology in this process has supported this activity and has induced the appearance of new didactic strategies such as Flipped Learning, among others. While there seems to be an agreement about the advantages and benefits of this strategy compared to others, there is limited evidence about its effectiveness upon student knowledge. Furthermore, research about the relationship between this strategy and the characteristics of the students is scarce. This work aims to study the effects of the Flipped Learning strategy on the learning process of students as well as its association with student characteristics. A quantitative study was applied to 460 students majoring in design, engineering or architecture programs. A Flipped Learning methodology was evaluated in a pre-test/post-test process with focus and control groups. Normalized learning gains were measured to know if the students’ learning outcomes increased when compared to a traditional pedagogic strategy. Additionally, a study of the relationship between these learning gains and the learning styles of the students was conducted. Significant results were found that point to the benefits of Flipped Learning. From a statistical analysis, it was found that students in the focus group had a better performance than students in the control group. This difference is between 0.97280% and 22.79337%. Also, Kinesthetic students had the best learning gains, followed by students in the R, RK, and VRK classifications.",Huesca Juárez G.; Medina Herrera L.,Journal,International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing,2019-12-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Active learning ;  Educational innovation ;  Flipped learning ;  Learning gains ;  Learning styles ;  Undergraduate students
Research-based learning: a case study for engineering students,"An implementation of the research-based learning (RBL) model and methodologies for undergraduate Computational Engineering students at Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico City Campus was undertaken to highlight the importance of involving undergraduate students in professional research activities early in their career (curriculum). We present here the results of this study. Four phases of the project are described: (1) a diagnosis of initial RBL competencies of students; (2) the presentation of an introductory workshop on research methodology by the teacher; (3) the design of a monograph by the students; and (4) the preparation of a research project by the students, including a sketch of a research paper and a written and oral presentation to a jury of staff research professors. The objective of the project was the design and evaluation of algorithms of Data Science, Big Data and Deep Learning to perform a data processing analysis related to the problem of metabolic syndrome and its surrogates in Mexico. The results indicate that the initial research competencies of undergraduate students are insufficient, although about 50% of the students think the contrary. The students were able to work in teams during the semester, and most teams, guided by the instructor, were capable of developing appropriate monographs and high-quality sketches for their proposed research papers. In most cases, students showed great improvements in their RBL skills in doing extensive literature reviews and in performing appropriate statistical analyses of databases. This work supports the contention that it is particularly important to start developing RBL competencies early in undergraduate engineering careers in order to prepare undergraduate students for future graduate studies as well as for their professional lives.",Noguez J.; Neri L.,Journal,International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing,2019-12-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Didactic techniques ;  Educational innovation ;  Higher education ;  Learning activities ;  Research based learning ;  Research competencies
Research-based learning as a strategy for the integration of theory and practice and the development of disciplinary competencies in engineering,"Research-based learning (RBL) enhances the integration of different abilities and strengthens the students’ research skills. As a result, the students are actively involved in a real research project, which allows them to use and to correlate theoretical concepts to real needs in their occupational field. In this work, a course was redesigned by integrating two courses: one theoretical and one laboratory course of Enzymology and Biocatalysis, which belong to the academic plan of the biotechnology engineering career. Volunteer students who met the established requirements were selected and grouped into approximately four teams per semester. A research project was assigned to each team with a co-advisor, who was the person responsible for defining the research objectives. The course content was modularized in order to provide theoretical concepts along with the experimental activities required by their project. As a result of the strategy, students participating in the integrated course evidenced a significantly higher performance as measured by the final grades and failure percentage (91.13 ± 5.6 in general grade average and 0%, respectively). Some specific technical and transversal competencies were documented, showing a higher level of dominion and course satisfaction level, as expressed in a final survey. Through RBL strategy, students were able to generate experimental data and develop competencies for knowledge acquisition, a higher commitment level and improved research skills. All these, in turn, could make a significant difference in their performance and integration to the occupational field.",Mayolo-Deloisa K.; Ramos-de-la-Peña A.; Aguilar O.,Journal,International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing,2019-12-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Competencies development ;  Educational innovation ;  Integration ;  Research-based learning ;  Tec 21
Non-linear effects of technological competence on product innovation in new technology-based firms: Resource orchestration and the role of the entrepreneur's political competence and prior start-up experience,"The study applies the lens of resource orchestration theory to examine the nature of the relationship between technological competence and product innovation in new technology-based firms, and the moderating effects of the entrepreneur's political competence and prior start-up experience. Drawing upon a sample of 100 young technology-based firms, the results show that technological competence has an inverted U-shape relationship with product innovation, suggesting that returns to technological competence are increasing up to a crucial threshold level beyond which additional gains for innovation are decreasing. Political competence and prior start-up experience strengthen the positive effects of technological competence on innovation, with these abilities of the entrepreneurs increasing the optimal levels and innovation returns from technology competence. The results point to the level of technological competence and entrepreneurial competences as key contingencies that influence resource orchestration efficiency in the context of new venture innovation. These findings add to the burgeoning effort to advance research on resource orchestration at early stages of development of the firm, contributing to a deeper understanding of technology choices for value creation under conditions of limited resources and varying levels of individuals' orchestration capabilities.",Deligianni I.; Voudouris I.; Spanos Y.; Lioukas S.,Journal,Technovation,2019-12-01,Athens University of Economics and Business,Entrepreneur's competencies ;  Innovation ;  New technology based firms ;  Resource orchestration ;  Technological competence
Research on trust mechanism of cooperation innovation with big data processing based on blockchain,"In recent years, the status of cooperation and innovation has become increasingly important. Research on the behavior of production, education, and research organizations has attracted widespread attention. Blockchain technology is considered as another subversive technology following cloud computing, wireless sensor networks, and big data. It is highly concerned by governments, financial institutions, and technology companies. Blockchain technology is essentially a technical solution that collectively maintains a reliable database through a decentralized, high-trust way. Blockchain WEB technology has not only used in financial and other fields, but also has a great potential for application in the fields of production, education, and research. It has expected to play an important role in the establishment of a trust mechanism in the “Internet +” production, research, and innovation and promote education. Drawing on the experience in blockchain applications in the financial sector, the blockchain in the education sector mainly embodies six application modes: building individual science credit data, creating an intelligent education Taobao platform, developing a degree certificate system, and building a new ecology of open educational resources. Of course, due to the uniqueness and complexity of the trust field in the cooperation innovation of industry, universities, and research institutes, the application of blockchain technology is also faced with difficulties in the application, promotion, and operation of production and research, fuzzy ownership of educational big data, limited data storage space, and potential safety problems of blockchain technology.

Real-time data-driven motion correction in PET,"PET imaging has been, and continues to be, an evolving diagnostic technology. In recent years, the modernizing digital landscape has opened new opportunities for data-driven innovation. One such facet has been data-driven motion correction (DDMC) in PET. As both research and industry propel this technology forward, we can recognize prospects and opportunities for further development. The concept of clinical practicality is supported by DDMC approaches—it is what sets them apart from traditional hardware-driven motion correction strategies that have largely not gained acceptance in routine diagnostic PET; the ease of use of DDMC may help propel acceptance of motion correction solutions in clinical practice. As we reflect on the present field, we should consider that DDMC can be made even more practical, and likely more impactful, if further developed to fit within a real-time acquisition framework. This vision for development is not new, but has been made more feasible with contemporary electronics, and has begun to be revisited in contemporary literature. The opportunities for development lie on a new forefront of innovation where medical physics integrates with engineering, data science, and modern computing capacities. Real-time DDMC is a systems integration challenge, and achieving it will require cooperation between hardware and software developers, and likely academia and industry. While challenges for development do exist, it is likely that we will see real-time DDMC come to fruition in the coming years. This effort may establish groundwork for developing similar innovations in the emerging digital innovation age.",Kesner A.; Schmidtlein C.; Kuntner C.,Journal,EJNMMI Physics,2019-12-01,Austrian Institute of Technology;Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center,Data-driven gating ;  Data-driven motion correction ;  Digital innovation ;  PET ;  Real-time
Investigating the preferences of individuals on public transport innovations using the Maximum Difference Scaling method,"Introduction: Public Transport users have diverse mobility needs and preferences on how to meet those needs. While this is consistent with typical standards for both academic scholars and practitioners, less is known about the structure of these preferences, how different they are, especially with regard to innovations in Public Transport. Previous research works have been successful in bringing together and developing a comprehensive set of state-of-the-art innovations that could be potentially valuable for Public Transport Authorities and Operators in covering mobility needs. Purpose: Going a step further, this study collected empirical evidence on the preferences’ pattern of European citizens when considering these innovations. The present study’s objectives were (a) to measure European citizens’ preferences regarding Public Transport innovations, (b) to examine potential differences at individual level between innovations and demographic and behavioral measures, and (c) to profile respondents based on a multidimensional set of parameters including individual preference scores. Methods: Correspondingly, the study employed complementary methodological designs like the Maximum Difference Scaling method, which is an effective tool for encompassing large numbers of attributes, Analysis of Variance, and Latent Class Analysis. Results: Findings prioritized significant differences in user preferences along the tested innovations and innovations were linked to specific motivational schemes (viz. “information provision”, “efficient design concerns”, “provision of effectiveness”, “pricing concerns”, and “assistance provision”). Motivational schemes and their properties encompassing users’ diverse patterns of ranked preferences regarding Public Transport innovations were then employed as the basis for profiling. Conclusion: Further to methodological contributions reflecting the design of the present study, implications for practitioners regarding the use of differentiated mix of motives are also provided.",Tsafarakis S.; Gkorezis P.; Nalmpantis D.; Genitsaris E.; Andronikidis A.; Altsitsiadis E.,Journal,European Transport Research Review,2019-12-01,KU Leuven;Technical University of Crete;Aristotle University of Thessaloniki;University of Macedonia;Tero Ltd.,Analysis of Variance ;  Innovation ;  Latent Class Analysis ;  Maximum Difference Scaling method ;  Preferences ;  Public transport
Lost in translation: How legacy limits the OECD in promoting new policy mixes for sustainability transitions,"The OECD has a strong legacy in shaping innovation policy mixes. The purpose of this paper is therefore to provide a better understanding of how the OECD is currently shaping new policy mixes for sustainability transitions. It provides a detailed account of the uptake of system innovation thinking, a key concept in transition studies, at the OECD. It takes an ethnographic approach combining desk research with participant observation, allowing to study ‘discourse in the making’. The paper traces the different translation and inscription strategies pursued. It finds that despite purposeful efforts, system innovation has not been institutionalised in the core activities of the organisation, thus can be considered ‘lost in translation’. It concludes that legacy effects created a number of sticking points that can be categorised under three main categories: (1) institutional, arising from previous ways of working; (2) cognitive, arising from ways of framing and knowing and (3) political, arising from pre-existing power relations. Suggestions are made for both innovation policy academics and practitioners interested in promoting a transformative innovation agenda.",Diercks G.,Journal,Research Policy,2019-12-01,Imperial College London,Discourse institutionalisation ;  Legacy effects ;  OECD ;  Policy mixes ;  Sustainability transitions ;  System innovation
Ethics and the UN Sustainable Development Goals: The Case for Comprehensive Engineering: Commentary on “Using Student Engagement to Relocate Ethics to the Core of the Engineering Curriculum”,"In the twenty-first century, the urgent problems the world is facing (the UN Sustainable Development Goals) are increasingly related to vast and intricate ‘systems of systems’, which comprise both socio-technical and eco-systems. In order for engineers to adequately and responsibly respond to these problems, they cannot focus on only one technical or any other aspect in isolation, but must adopt a wider and multidisciplinary perspective of these systems, including an ethical and social perspective. Engineering curricula should therefore focus on what we call ‘comprehensive engineering’.

"Structural performance of multi-storey building using flat slab and conventional slab to seismic loads (Case study: Faculty building of Sport Science in Universitas Negeri Malang, Indonesia)","Innovations to increase the effective height of storeys in buildings are using a flat slab system. Flat slab system is a slab that is only supported by columns without any supporting beam. By the abstain of beams, designers are able to reduce the storey height and to reduce the structural weight. Other than that, flat slabs offer a more flexible installation of building utilities, simpler reinforcement, and simpler installation of scaffolding and formwork. This study was conducted to analyse the performance of flat slabs when applied to buildings compared with the conventional slabs. The flat slab system is expected to be able to withstand gravity and earthquake loads. The Building of the Faculty of Sport Science, Universitas Negeri Malang, with a total of 7 floors and 1 semi-basement was used as research object. This research was conducted using programme simulation, ETABS and SAP2000. The research was intended to analyse the resulting seismic base shear, the fundamental period, the structural stiffness, the ultimate performance evaluation, and the storey drift if the building designed using flat slab system. Results showed that (1) Building with flat slab system has a lighter weight than the one with conventional slab system. Building weight affects the seismic base shear value of the building. The heavier a building is, the greater the seismic base shear value of a building; (2) The fundamental period analysis resulted the structural vibration time (Tc) in flat slab structure is greater than in the conventional slabs. The heavier the building weight, the structural vibration time (Tc) that occurs will be smaller; (3) The structural stiffness of building using flat slab system is less than in the conventional slabs system; (4) Both of building using flat slab system and conventional slabs meet the requirement of service performance and ultimate performance; and (5) The storey drift in building using flat slab system is larger than in the conventional slabs. This is due to the conventional slab structure has a greater stiffness than flat slab structure.",Pradhana R.; Pratama M.; Santoso E.; Karjanto A.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2019-11-21,Universitas Negeri Malang,

Infrastructures and society: from a literature review to a conceptual framework,"While economic and environmental aspects of civil engineering have attracted the greatest attention among contemporary academy, its social side has frequently been set aside. However, the social impact that infrastructures have is huge and its analysis and understanding are fundamental. At the same time, social aspects such as culture or human behaviour can have significant effects during the different stages of the lifecycle of infrastructures. Therefore, a better understanding of the connections between civil engineering and society can help to better adapt infrastructures to their contexts, as well as minimise their negative impacts; as a result, this understanding can bring about infrastructures that are more socially sustainable. The scarce studies that have assessed the connection between society and civil engineering have considered this relationship as unidirectional. The real scenario is not so simple. The analysis of this relationship needs to be interdisciplinary, and it is in this context that this paper addresses the analysis of infrastructures and of social sciences from a sociotechnical point of view. We draw on the interrelationships found to propose a conceptual framework with the main objective of providing both practitioners and academics with tools to carry out more sustainable and context-adapted decisions. We classify the fields of civil engineering and social sciences into several different subfields, namely six for infrastructures (transport, water, energy, environment, urban planning and buildings) and twelve for social sciences (culture and history, behaviour and mind, communication and interaction, socioeconomics, juridical sciences, life and health, politics, social problems, social groups, ethics and philosophy, arts and education and innovation). Afterwards, we review the existing literature at the intersection between the various categories. We conclude proposing a framework that can support decisions and actions made at different levels and working areas. The framework includes guidelines for a more holistic consideration of the interaction between infrastructures and society in key activities whereby an improved understanding of the effect of this relationship is often required. The guidelines provide a description of different key areas and can be applied to a wide variety of actions ranging from the development of university curricula to the social impact assessment of projects.",Josa I.; Aguado A.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2019-11-20,Universitat Politécnica de Catalunya,Civil engineering ;  Humanities ;  Interdisciplinarity ;  Social sciences ;  Social sustainability
Efficiency evaluation of green technology innovation of China's strategic emerging industries: An empirical analysis based on Malmquist-data envelopment analysis index,"Green technology innovation is the main driving force for sustainable development of China's strategic emerging industries. Improving the efficiency of green technology innovation is an effective way to achieve this developmental goal. The correct approach to measuring the efficiency of green technology innovation is a hot issue. Based on the panel data of China's 21 subdivided industries of strategic emerging industries over the period from 2004 to 2015, this paper applies the Malmquist index and data envelopment analysis to evaluate the efficiency of green technology innovation in strategic emerging industries. The empirical results show that changes in trends of technology innovation efficiency of strategic emerging industries are increasing, due mainly to technological progress and promotion of technology efficiency. Promotion of technology efficiency results from the joint action of pure technology efficiency increasing (0.1%) and scale efficiency increasing (0.2%). The change index of green technology innovation efficiency varies greatly in different industries, being highest (1.379) in communications switching equipment manufacturers and lowest (0.775) among office equipment manufacturers. There are three obvious troughs in the change index of green technology innovation efficiency over the period from 2004 to 2015. These troughs are declines of 19.5% in 2005, 16% in 2009, and 45.4% in 2012.",Luo Q.; Miao C.; Sun L.; Meng X.; Duan M.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2019-11-20,Wuhan University;Anhui University of Science and Technology,Green technology innovation ;  Malmquist-data envelopment analysis ;  Strategic emerging industries ;  Technology efficiency

Value creation through quality and innovation – a case study on Portugal,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the best way to create value in Portugal through quality and innovation and also to check what needs to be improved. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire was applied to population of 152 companies, with the research and development (R&D) management certified by Portuguese Standard NP 4457. The final sample was 66 companies, which correspond to 45 percent of the population. Statistical analysis of the data collected was performed using IBM SPSS Statistical Software. Findings: The authors highlighted the main reasons/motivations that led companies to implement the NP 4457, which were, among others, competitive advantage and creating value. The systematization of information and the generation and management of ideas were highlighted as the main advantages. The lack of methodologies for innovation management and knowledge management was the difficulty experienced in the implementation of NP 4457. Portugal needs to increase patent registration and it also needs to know how to take advantage of the investment made in R&D, in order to decrease the unit cost of knowledge. Portuguese engineering should be more about product design than production processes. The involvement of top management must be greater. Originality/value: This investigation contributes to the innovation and quality body of knowledge, since it explores the complementarity between the two concepts as sources of value creation. This case study is one of the first Portuguese empirical research works about value creation through quality and innovation in Portugal.

"Value-added innovation in infrastructure systems, lessons learned from wastewater treatment plants","Purpose: Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are evolving toward sustainability. The purpose of this paper is to discuss how innovation can develop these mission-based service industries to value-added manufacturing enterprises. Here, innovation is embedded in altering the understanding of stakeholders toward the objectives and managerial systems of these infrastructures. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses multidisciplinary principles in management, economics and engineering to assess the integration of innovation and quality management with different perspectives. It initially compares the conventional and innovative approach for operating WWTPs. Subsequently, it emphasizes the contribution of the tailor-made managerial system of wastewater treatment enterprises through prospective markets, customers’ preferences, probable competitions and shared values. Findings: The tailor-made managerial system for wastewater treatment can add economic values by manufacturing multiple demand products for local markets. Water, green energy, organic fertilizers and raw materials are the main products that can be simultaneously recovered according to the customers’ demand. The Kano model also verifies that the new managerial system has this potential to turn the conventional must-be treatment systems into delightful enterprises. It can provide different stakeholders with shared social and environmental values. Accordingly, locals and customers can be engaged in monitoring the quality of products to consider their feedback for decision making and upgrading. This indirectly defines shared values among operators and society to reinforce localization and ecosystem protection. Additionally, this research reveals that the market of the aforementioned strategic products is promising as a blue ocean for set sail due to the lack of competitors.

Management innovation: a dynamic analysis of the implementation phase over time,"We develop management innovation theory, providing insights into the role of time in the implementation phase. The management innovation literature has sought to empirically identify factors that facilitate or hinder management innovation implementation from a static perspective. To address the evolution of these factors’ resistance, a temporal perspective is appropriate, but an analysis of these factors’ evolution over time is lacking. We identify the inhibiting factors that influence the management innovation implementation phase over time and address ways in which they evolve.We conduct a comparative longitudinal and dynamic analysis based on two intermediate-sized enterprises and address the obstacles that emerge during the implementation phase of a specific management innovation: lean manufacturing. Our results highlight different categories of inhibiting factors: some inhibiting factors appear at the beginning of the implementation phase with high intensity and then fade over time; conversely, other inhibiting factors appear later and then increase in intensity.",Robert M.; Giuliani P.; Guilloton A.; Khallouk M.,Journal,Production Planning and Control,2019-11-18,Montpellier Business School;Le Mans Université;Vichy Thermalia Spa Hotel,dynamic analysis ;  implementation phase ;  inhibiting factors ;  Management innovation
Research progress and perspective of machine learning in material design,"With rapid development of economy and society, the excessive demand for resources has caused the imbalance of ecological environment. It is therefore urgent to develop new functional materials, especially energy conversion materials, to solve the scientific and engineering problems in the field of resources and environment. However, the research and development of materials was traditionally based on inefficient trial-and-error experiments. Although state-of-the-art approach such as density functional theory (DFT) is able to simulate materials properties, the calculations of high temperature, high pressure and strong magnetic field environment, as well as the selection of strong and weak correlation system between electrons and interaction potential between atoms are still unsatisfactory. Huge amount of data produced by experiments and simulations provides databases for machine learning. Combining the theory of probability and statistics algorithm, machine learning has recently made much progress in the new material discovery and design, the prediction of material performance and application and other purposes ranged from the macroscopic to the microscopic scale, such as the statistics classification of perovskite materials, the stability prediction of perovskite materials based on high-throughput computing and intermetallic compound electrocatalysts design and selection, etc. Meanwhile, developing a physically interpretable descriptor that captures the trend of materials properties is a critical goal of data-driven science. Machine learning has been applied in the field of materials science and engineering, exhibiting a different perspective from traditional approaches. In this paper, recent progress of materials design in photovoltaics, electrocatalytic and performance evaluation of energy storage batteries are reviewed. In those efforts, machine learning aims to discover the relationships among compositional and structural features and functionality in complex systems of materials. Machine learning is a data-driven approach that relies heavily on data. Compared with image recognition and other fields that usually have millions of data, material science research often leads to over-fitting of machine learning models when the amount of training data is limited, which greatly reduces the generalization ability of machine learning methods. In order to increase the amount of material data, researchers can obtain theoretical data through high-throughput computing on the one hand, and develop methods for intelligent reading of literatures to access and obtain a large number of relevant experimental and theoretical data from publications on the other hand. Another promising method to solve the problem of finite data sets is meta-learning, that is, learning knowledge within or across problems. The development of new technologies such as neural Turing machine and imitation learning makes this process possible. Recently, it has been reported that Bayesian optimization can reach the experience level of human judgment on things through one-shot learning under the condition of limited data, which may have a huge promotion effect on materials science with scarce data with slow and expensive acquisition speed. Although machine learning methods have greatly improved their predictive accuracy in material discovery, design, performance and application, they have not expanded well in terms of transferability. Active learning methods also provide consistent and automated improvements in accuracy and transferability, making a significant contribution to the success of the universal model. In addition, one of the promising point of material science using machine learning method is to develop new descriptor owning physical interpretability, makes the black box model of statistical machine learning be explainable. In a word, the development of computer intelligence algorithms would promote the innovation of new materials discovery.",Sun Z.; Li Z.; Cheng G.; Xu Q.; Hou Z.; Yin W.,Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2019-11-15,"State Key Laboratory of Structural Chemistry, Fuzhou;Soochow University",Descriptor ;  Energy conversion ;  Machine learning ;  Material design

"Mapping innovation and diffusion of hydrogen fuel cell technologies: Evidence from the UK's hydrogen fuel cell technological innovation system, 1954–2012","With the global sustainability transition in energy, hydrogen fuel cell (HFC) applications currently have important niche roles to play across several industrial sectors. Theorists examining this innovative activity have identified key socio-technical factors affecting the nature and pace of change. One functional approach to innovation, Technology-Specific Innovation Systems (TSISs), places national HFC Technological Innovation Systems (TISs) within a framework of a global HFC TSIS. This analytical approach suggests that HFC innovation can start anywhere in space. However, in a case study of HFC innovation and diffusion in the UK covering sixty years’ activity, this theoretical assumption is challenged. Event history analysis and interviews using a neofunctionalist TSIS approach suggest that positive feedback was on the brink of occurring in the UK HFC TIS by 2012. When additional organisational and spatial indicators are added, the evidence on the ground does not support the aspatial assumptions that underlie TIS heuristic thinking. Rather, it suggested that type of investment funding and spatial location can influence HFC innovation. In this context, the implications for HFC policy in the UK are discussed.",Hacking N.; Pearson P.; Eames M.,Journal,International Journal of Hydrogen Energy,2019-11-15,Cardiff University;Imperial College London,Hydrogen fuel cells ;  Innovation ;  Spatial ;  Sustainability ;  TSIS ;  UK

"Global status of wind power generation: theory, practice, and challenges","The existence of environmental concerns and constraints has led to a much greater necessity for the development of renewable energy resources. Wind energy resources are one of the most promising avenues for renewable energy generation, and the field has experienced significant technological innovation and growth over the past few years. This paper reviews various issues related to wind-power generation resources. Current trends, over the last two decades, of increasing wind turbine sizes, rated power-generation capacity, efficiencies, and the actual size of wind farm facilities are projected to continue. It is theorized that the current global installed capacity of wind power generation may increase from the current generation of 540 (2017) to 5800 GW by 2050. Wind energy potential, in terms of vertical wind speed profile, mean wind-speed distribution, turbulence effects and gust, are discussed in detail in this paper. A decreasing trend in the cost of initial capital investment and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE), for both onshore and offshore wind-power generation developments, are projected to continue, although this is regionally and economy-size dependent. Key challenges have been identified for the development of wind power generation in developed and under-developed countries going forward. New approaches/developments in the field and avenues for further research or actions that can be undertaken are also outlined in this paper. Materialization of such lines of actionsmay lead to an increase in global wind energy from its current level of around 4% of the electricity generation mix to roughly 40%.",Arshad M.; O’Kelly B.,Journal,International Journal of Green Energy,2019-11-14,"University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore;Trinity College Dublin",cost of energy ;  offshore engineering ;  Renewable energy ;  wind velocity

"Neural engineering: The process, applications, and its role in the future of medicine","Objective. Recent advances in neural engineering have restored mobility to people with paralysis, relieved symptoms of movement disorders, reduced chronic pain, restored the sense of hearing, and provided sensory perception to individuals with sensory deficits. Approach. This progress was enabled by the team-based, interdisciplinary approaches used by neural engineers. Neural engineers have advanced clinical frontiers by leveraging tools and discoveries in quantitative and biological sciences and through collaborations between engineering, science, and medicine. The movement toward bioelectronic medicines, where neuromodulation aims to supplement or replace pharmaceuticals to treat chronic medical conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes and psychiatric disorders is a prime example of a new frontier made possible by neural engineering. Although one of the major goals in neural engineering is to develop technology for clinical applications, this technology may also offer unique opportunities to gain insight into how biological systems operate. Main results. Despite significant technological progress, a number of ethical and strategic questions remain unexplored. Addressing these questions will accelerate technology development to address unmet needs. The future of these devices extends far beyond treatment of neurological impairments, including potential human augmentation applications. Our task, as neural engineers, is to push technology forward at the intersection of disciplines, while responsibly considering the readiness to transition this technology outside of the laboratory to consumer products.

FRP composites, as high strength, lightweight and high performance reinforcement materials, have been widely used not only in China, but also in foreign countries and in water and soil engineering. China has made a series of achievements in the development of high-performance FRP materials and their products suitable for civil engineering applications, and in the application of FRP key technologies in civil engineering. In the development of concrete structures in the new century, new requirements and challenges have been put forward for materials. Because FRP is a frontal composite material composed of many kinds of materials, its common advantages are light weight, high strength and elastic modulus, fatigue resistance, long service time, good corrosion resistance and low thermal expansion coefficient, etc. FPR is a new type of high performance material, which is of great significance to the sustainable development of civil engineering industry in our country. This paper introduces the properties and forms of FRP materials commonly used in structural engineering, puts forward the rational application of FRP and its structure, and analyses its advantages and disadvantages in order to promote the application and research of this new type of high performance material in civil engineering in China.",Zhouxiaofan.,Conference Proceeding,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,2019-11-07,Jinan University,
"RoPax, the Layout History and Analysis","The research in question intends to investigate the sector of RoPax, or rather the ships destined to the mixed transportation of passengers and vehicles equipped with wheels. Moreover, today considered among the most exciting carriers in the field of Transportation Design thanks to the positive effects their use has highlighted in the area of trade and territorial cohesion. The ferry has spread in Europe since the second half of the twentieth century, an era characterized by a relentless post-war economic recovery that favored the development of trade routes and shipbuilding. The ferry is the direct extension of road and rail networks over water in the absence of land infrastructure. It is no coincidence that it derives from the 'landing ship tank,' the ships built for amphibious operations that allowed soldiers and vehicles to land on the beach, from which it inherited its versatility and practicality as values of identity that distinguish the spirit of the journey. The study aims to bring out the most significant transformations inherent to the architectural form of the ship, through the analysis and comparison of selected unit drawings based on collective criteria, such as the type of cargo, the geographical area of service, etc. What matters most is reconstructing the evolution of the layout to understand the motivations that have guided the design choices to date. Among the many variables of a technical and stylistic nature, ferry design is extremely influenced by the social transformations and lifestyles of passengers. Recently, the use of the ferry has recorded a surge that has prompted shipping companies to increase the quality of services and entertainment onboard. Therefore, navigating on a ferry whose meaning has changed from a 'spartan' journey to a comfortable one, almost as a cruise ship. The comparison between engineering and architecture has become more relevant than ever for the construction of good ships. Thus, the next challenges will be dictated by sustainable innovation and the digital revolution, opening the door to new scenarios in the shipbuilding industry, which will again change the RoPax layout.",Cascino C.; Arini F.,Conference Proceeding,Progress in Marine Science and Technology,2019-11-06,Università degli Studi di Genova;Ship Designer and Interior Architect at Knud E.

Clinical translation of the assets of biomedical engineering–a retrospective analysis with looks to the future,"Introduction: Biomedical-engineering (BME) plays a major role in modern medicine. Many BME-based assets have been brought to clinical translation in the twentieth century, but translation currently stagnates. Here, we compare the impact of past and present scientific, economic and societal climates on the translation of BME-based assets, in order to provide the BME-community with incentives to address current stagnation. Areas covered: In the twentieth century, W.J. Kolff brought kidney dialysis, the total artificial heart, artificial vision and limbs to clinical application. This success raises the question whether Kolff and other past giants of clinical translation had special mind-sets, or whether their problem selection, their training, or governmental and regulatory control played roles. Retrospective analysis divides the impact of BME-based assets to clinical application into three periods: 1900–1970: rapid translation from bench-to-bedside, 1970–1990: new diseases and increased governmental control, and the current translational crisis from 1990 onward. Expert opinion: Academic and societal changes can be discerned that are concurrent with BME’s translational success: mono-disciplinary versus multi-disciplinary training, academic reward systems based on individual achievements versus team achievements with strong leadership, increased governmental and regulatory control, and industrial involvement. From this, recommendations can be derived for accelerating clinical translation of BME-assets.",Ren Y.; Fagette P.; Hall C.; Broers H.; Grainger D.; Van Der Mei H.; Busscher H.,Journal,Expert Review of Medical Devices,2019-11-02,The University of Utah;Universitair Medisch Centrum Groningen;The College of New Jersey;Willem Kolff Foundation (Kampen,biomedical engineering ;  clinical impact ;  innovation ;  medical technology ;  Translational medicine ;  translational stagnation ;  valorization

How to combine the Technology Multi Business Innovation concept with the CDIO framework - The MBMI Case Challenge Process Model,"Many Universities and businesses have focus on change in the educational didactics approach to the engineering studies. This focus and change are supported by industries, as there is an increasing strong demand to change engineering student's mindset to be able to also bridge technology to business models and business. The focus on supporting educational activities, linking engineering students mindset to a technological business model innovation mindset for the purpose to apply their engineering academic, theoretical knowledge to business modelling and business - and in this case the Multi Business Model Innovation (MBMI) approach - is simply based in the fact that technology innovation needs business models and vice versa. Technology need to complement and become embedded in business models. To facilitate this change and related activities, AU has over some years developed two new concepts - The AU Case Competition Network challenge [1] and The TBMI Challenge [2]. The paper reports on experiment at 'CDIO Academy' conference held at Aarhus University and in June/July 2019 where CGC research group carried out a 7-week TBMI Summer School TBMI Challenge. The challenge referred to in this paper focus mainly on the AU Case Competition Challenge based on The CDIO™ INITIATIVE [2]. The paper reflects on the results of an experiment with the aim to form a pedagogical and business model innovation frame for Case and TBMI challenge. The paper presents a framework model to facilitate engineering student teams' and in extension interdisciplinary engineering teams in businesses. The paper reports on the working and learning progression in case challenge engineering workspaces, and try to answer the research question: 'How to clarify the transition of shifts in the work process from start to the end of a case or TBMI challenge?

Explaining heterogeneity in the organization of scientific work,"Prior studies of academic science have largely focused on researchers in life sciences or engineering. However, while academic researchers often work under similar institutions, norms, and incentives, they vary greatly in how they organize their research efforts across different scientific domains. This heterogeneity, in turn, has important implications for innovation policy, the relationship between industry and academia, the scientific labor market, and the perceived deficit in the relevance of social sciences and humanities research. To understand this heterogeneity, we model scientists as publication-maximizing agents, identifying two distinct organizational patterns that are optimal under different parameters. When the net productivity of research staff (e.g., PhD students and postdocs) is positive, the funded research model with an entrepreneurial scientist and a large team dominates. When the costs of research staff exceed their productivity benefits, the hands-on research approach is optimal. The model implies significant heterogeneity across the two modes of organizing in research funding, supply of scientific workforce, team size, publication output, and stratification patterns over time. Exploratory empirical analysis finds consistent patterns of time allocation and publication in a prior survey of faculty in U.S. universities. Using data from an original survey, we also find causal effects consistent with the model's prediction on how negative shocks to research staff-due to visa or health problems, for example-differentially impact research output under the two modes of organization.",Rahmandad H.; Vakili K.,Journal,Organization Science,2019-11-01,MIT Sloan School of Management;London Business School,Academic research ;  Collaboration ;  Performance heterogeneity ;  Research funding ;  Research relevance ;  Science policy ;  Scientific teams ;  University industry relationship

What is the role of social and cultural factors of the transition to adulthood and how these factors are influenced? an examination of Greek higher education students,"Through of a series of publications Amett describes the period of the post teen to mid second twenties in the life of a person as emerging adult period. It is a period of development distinguished by unique features that include feeling in-between, identity exploration, a focus on the self instability, and possibilities. This article argues that cultural beliefs and norms about socialization and social relationships are likely to affect the meaning and developmental patterns of emerging adulthood. More traditional, nonwestern cultures may have a shortened period of emerging adulthood, or no emerging adulthood at all, because these cultures tend to place greater emphasis 011 practices that lead to an earlier transition to adulthood.

Research on China's financial situation and real economy development-Monthly data from China 2000-2017,"This paper uses the mixture innovation time-varying parameter vector autoregressive models with stochastic volatility model (MI-TVP-SV-VAR) to construct the China financial status index (MFCI) to measure China's financial situation. Based on the multifractal asymmetric detrended cross-correlation analysis (MF-ADCCA) algorithm, the MFCI is used to predict the development of the real economy. In the empirical study, the research sample selects the monthly data of China from 2000 to 2017. The empirical results show that the weights of various financial status variables have flexible time-varying, and the stock price, bond price and real estate price have greater weight in MFCI. During the sample period, MFCI is able to maintain a consistency trend with the development of the real economy (EC) and is ahead of changes in the real economy. The asymmetric correlation test based on MF-ADCCA algorithm shows that MFCI has a persistent cross-correlation with EC. The decline of MFCI will lead to the decline of EC, and the rise of MFCI will lead to the rise of EC. The cross-effect of MFCI on EC changes the asymmetric influence of the individual sequence itself, indicating that the impact of China's financial situation on the development of the real economy exists, and MFCI has a predictive effect on the development of the real economy. The intertemporal correlation test shows that the predictive effect of MFCI on the real economy is more effective within 6 months.",Liu C.; Ma Y.; Xie Q.,Journal,Xitong Gongcheng Lilun yu Shijian/System Engineering Theory and Practice,2019-11-01,Beijing University of Technology,China's financial status index ;  MFADCCA algorithm ;  MI-TVP-SV-VAR model ;  Prediction ;  Real economic development
Sustainable development of new urbanization from the perspective of coordination: A new complex system of urbanization-technology innovation and the atmospheric environment,"Exploring the coordinated development of urbanization (U), technology innovation (T), and the atmospheric environment (A) is an important way to realize the sustainable development of new-type urbanization in China. Compared with existing research, we developed an integrated index system that accurately represents the overall effect of the three subsystems of UTA, and a new weight determination method, the structure entropy weight (SEW), was introduced. Then, we constructed a coordinated development index (CDI) of UTA to measure the level of sustainability of new-type urbanization. This study also analyzed trends observed in UTA for 11 cities in Zhejiang Province of China, using statistical panel data collected from 2006 to 2017. The results showed that: (1) urbanization efficiency, the benefits of technological innovation, and air quality weigh the most in the indicator systems, which indicates that they are key factors in the behavior of UTA. The subsystem scores of the 11 cities show regional differences to some extent. (2) Comparing the coordination level of UTA subsystems, we found that the order is: coordination degree of UT > coordination degree of UA > coordination degree of TA. This suggests that the atmospheric environment system improvement is an important strategic decision for sustainable urbanization in Zhejiang. (3) The UTACDI values of the 11 cities are not high enough, as the coordination is mainly low, basic, or good, while none of the cities reached the stage of excellent coordination. (4) Gray Model (1,1) revealed that the time taking to achieve excellent coordination varies for different cities. Hangzhou and Ningbo were predicted to reach the excellent coordination level in 2018. Other cities are predicted to take 2-4 years to adjust their urbanization strategies enough to be considered to have excellent coordination of their UTA system.",Jiang B.; Ding L.; Fang X.,Journal,Atmosphere,2019-11-01,Ningbo Polytechnic;315832 China,Atmospheric environment system ;  Coordinated development index ;  New-type urbanization ;  Sustainability evaluation ;  Urbanization-technology innovation ;  Zhejiang Province
Modelling the influence of product development on business performance and competitiveness in manufacturing enterprises,"In this paper the influence of product innovation and development on business performance and competitiveness in small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises is addressed. The research was conducted via survey and it included over 2200 manufacturing enterprises from Serbia. The number of returned and usable surveys was 132 (5.98% return rate). The regression model included product development and innovation as two important engineering endeavours and business performance and competitiveness. Additionally, product quality, quality management system (QMS) and human resource management (HRM) were included in the data analysis. The results indicate that the observed relationships between the measured constructs are different, and they depend on how many employees the enterprise has. This paper contributes to the existing body of literature, provides a solid basis for future research in this domain, and other researchers and managers can use this paper as an insight to the relationships between important business metrics.",Bakator M.; Đorđević D.; Ćoćkalo D.,Journal,Tehnicki Vjesnik,2019-11-01,University of Novi Sad,Business performance ;  Competitiveness ;  Manufacturing enterprises ;  Product development ;  Product innovation ;  Quality management system
Effect of Work-Family Balance on Innovation Performance of Female Knowledge Workers: A Cross-level Moderated Mediation Model,"According to the emotional events theory, situational forces theory and related literature, and based on the paired survey data of 101 supervisors and 378 employees, the cross-level analysis method was used to explore the passing mechanism between work-family balance and innovation performance of female knowledge workers and to analyze the moderating role of transformational leadership. The results showed that female knowledge workers' work-family balance has a significant positive impact on innovation performance. Job well-being plays a mediating role between work-family balance and innovation performance of female knowledge workers. Transformational leadership moderates the mediating role of job well-being from work-family balance to innovation performance of female knowledge workers.",Zhang L.; Song J.; Tan J.; Wei C.,Journal,Dongbei Daxue Xuebao/Journal of Northeastern University,2019-11-01,"School of Business Administration, Northeastern University;China Fortune Land Development Industrial Investment Co.

Design methodology for soft wearable devices-the MOSAR case,"This paper proposes a methodology from the conception to the manufacture of soft wearable devices (SWD). This methodology seeks to unify medical, therapeutic and engineering guidelines for research, development and innovation. The aforementioned methodology is divided into two stages (A and B) and four phases. Stage A only includes phase 1 to identify the main necessity for a patient that will define the target of its associated device. Stage B encompasses phases 2, 3 and 4. The development of three models (virtual, mathematical and experimental physical) of the required device is addressed in phase 2. Phase 3 concerns the control and manufacture of the experimental physical model (EPM). Phase 4 focuses on the EPM experimental validation. As a result of this methodology, 13 mobility, 11 usability and 3 control iterative design criteria for SWD are reported. Moreover, more than 50 products are provided on a technological platform with modular architectures that facilitate SWD diversification. A case study related to a soft mobilizer for upper limb rehabilitation is reported. Nevertheless, this methodology can be implemented in different areas and accelerates the transition from development to innovation.",Dávila-Vilchis J.; Laz-Avilés.; Vilchis J.; Vilchis-González A.,Journal,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),2019-11-01,Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México,Design methodology ;  Modular platform ;  Soft robotics ;  Soft wearable devices ;  Uppe limb rehabilitation
A networked analysis and engineering framework for new business models,"New technological possibilities and paradigm shifts from product-centered to service-centered offerings are one of the main drivers of business models. Business ventures today are more and more networked. Often, various partners are needed to deliver a service or product to frequently cross-linked customers with sometimes bi- or even multi-variant roles. Furthermore, business models are embedded in socio-technical systems where different kinds of needs and values of all actors, including social, ecological, technical and economic values, have to be balanced. The resulting complex network of actors, needs and values requires continuous management in order to create and operate viable and sustainable business models. This paper proposes a multi-layer framework to analyze existing business models as well as to shape new business ventures in a networked and values-based way and to support the identification of tacit network effects within business ecosystems. Based on an existing multi-layered analysis toolkit, focusing on legal and business dynamics aspects, an enhanced visualization and analysis tool is proposed that focuses especially on ethical, social and environmental aspects to foster the creation of (strongly) sustainable business models. The research process to create the presented approach followed the Design Science Research paradigm by applying argumentative-deductive analysis (ADA) and first applications in real-world case studies. A practical case from an international Open Source Software (OSS) project serves as an example to illustrate this values-based visualization and analysis layer and its benefits for managers and decision makers in the area of business model and information system management.",Vorraber W.; Müller M.,Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2019-11-01,"Graz University of Technology, Institute of Software Technology;Technische Universitat Graz",Business model innovation ;  Design science research ;  Information systems engineering ;  Sustainable business models
The Role of Mathematics in interdisciplinary STEM education,"In times of rapid technological innovation and global challenges, the development of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) competencies becomes important. They improve the personal scientific literacy of citizens, enhance international economic competitiveness and are an essential foundation for responsible citizenship, including the ethical custodianship of our planet. The latest programme for international student assessment results, however, indicate that even in economically mature countries such as those in Europe, and the USA and Australia, approximately 20% of students lack sufficient skills in mathematics or science. This trend serves to highlight the urgent need for action in relation to STEM education. While it is widely acknowledged that mathematics underpins all other STEM disciplines, there is clear evidence it plays an understated role in integrated STEM education. In this article, we address an element of this concern by examining the role of mathematics within STEM education and how it might be advanced through three interdisciplinary approaches: (1) twenty-first century skills; (2) mathematical modelling; and (3) education for responsible citizenship. At the end of the paper we discuss the potential for research in relation to these three aspects and point to what work needs to be done in the future.",Maass K.; Geiger V.; Ariza M.; Goos M.,Journal,ZDM - Mathematics Education,2019-11-01,Pädagogische Hochschule Freiburg;Universidad de Jaén;Australian Catholic University;University of Limerick,Education for responsible citizenship ;  Mathematical Modelling ;  Numeracy ;  Socio-Scientific Issues ;  STEM education ;  The role of Mathematics in STEM ;  Twenty-first century skills
Optimization of the effect of nanoparticle morphologies on the cost of dye wastewater treatment via ultrasonic/photocatalytic hybrid process,"Treatment of dye wastewaters by nanoparticles is an attractive research in environmental engineering. In this research, for the treatment of wastewater containing methylene blue, a novel process was introduced in which a hybrid of ultrasound and photocatalysis was used. ZnO nanoparticle was employed as the catalyst. A synthesis technique for ZnO nanoparticles was used, and the resulted nanoparticle was capable of conducting photocatalytic activity in the visible light spectrum. Since the efficiency of a photocatalytic process in strongly dependent on the characteristics of the nanoparticle, in this study, the synthesis temperature parameter along with other parameters (that affect the ultrasonic/photocatalytic hybrid process such as pH, nanoparticle concentration, ultrasonic power, light source power, dye concentration, and time) were investigated as independent variables. Since treatment cost plays an important role in the selection for a proper treatment process, the cost of energy consumed in the hybrid process was chosen as the dependent variable. Examining the simultaneous effect of independent variables on the cost was one of the innovations of this research. Another novel aspect of this research is the determination of the synergetic or antagonistic effects of independent variables on each other. Furthermore, the optimal conditions to reach the optimum energy consumption level were also determined. Based on the SEM test results, the morphology of optimal nanoparticle (synthesized at 300 °C) was achieved, and the nanoparticle produced at this temperature was then analyzed via FTIR, XRD, EDS and BET techniques. The most appropriate conditions of the independent variables to reach the minimum energy consumption in treatment were observed at the pH of 8.76, nanoparticle concentration of 1.401 g/l, ultrasonic power of 119 W, light source power of 21.909 W, dye concentration of 45.905 ppm, and the process time of 13.695 min. According to the results, the optimum cost of the energy was about 0.001 ¢ for removing each milligram of dye and it obtained for optimum reaction conditions.",Khalegh R.; Qaderi F.,Journal,Applied Nanoscience (Switzerland),2019-11-01,Babol Noshirvani University of Technology,Methylene blue ;  Photocatalytic ;  Process cost ;  Ultrasonic ;  ZnO
The research and practice on teaching reform of the comprehensive experiment of microbiology,"Microbiology is an important foundation course for life sciences education which has intense theoretical and practical characteristics. However, the current experiment teaching system cannot meet the requirement of international engineering education accreditation well. To improve the teaching efficiency of microbiology experiment course, the current situation of this course for students studying bio-engineering is analyzed. Integrating requirements of engineering education accreditation and professional features, a comprehensive experimental project and experimental assessment mode were explored to cultivate students’ motivation and innovation consciousness. It was proved in practice that teaching reform had posed a positive effects on cultivating the inter-disciplinary talents and meeting the need of the social development. Through the experimental scheme, the students effectively obtained the abilities to design and implement experiments, and to analyze and to solve problems. The teaching reform fulfilled the requirements of the professional accreditation standard in engineering education.",Yan J.; Dong S.; Liu L.,Journal,International Journal of Information and Education Technology,2019-11-01,Kunming University of Science and Technology,Comprehensive experiment ;  Microbiology experiment course ;  Teaching reform

"Metrics-based profiling of university research engagement with Africa: research management, gender, and internationalization perspective","U.S. university engagement with Africa in various areas including global health, education, environment, and agriculture has grown in the last 15 years. However, there is limited literature that acknowledges the scholarly output and impact of U.S.-Africa university research collaboration in support of their respective institutions’ comprehensive internationalization goals. Using Michigan State University (MSU)—a public, research-intensive, land grant university with long history of engagement with Africa, as a case study, this paper aims to measure the research output, describe the collaboration patterns and research trends, and assess the impact of MSU’s research engagement on Africa for the last 10 years (2006–2015). It also attempts to determine the gender dimension of MSU’s research focus on Africa. Our scientometric and social network analysis provide strong quantitative evidence of scholarly success, research focus and diversification, collaboration, and impact on MSU’s engagement on Africa, especially in science, technology, engineering, and math-related disciplines. The co-authorship data provides evidence of greater collaboration of MSU with non-African countries on African-focused research but a growing number of partner institutions from African countries. This growing collaboration provides significant benefits on strategic research conducted and its impact, as well as increasing the recognition of African researchers as contributors to impactful international research collaborations and improving the ability of MSU and its global and African partners to co-generate knowledge and innovation that can help solve global problems more effectively. Finally, this study provides additional evidence of the increasing involvement of women in advancing knowledge and global innovation to address Africa’s socio-economic development challenges. The paper, overall, contributes to the science, research management, and gender perspectives of university internationalization goals and initiatives.",Payumo J.; Monson J.; Jamison A.; Fenwick B.,Journal,Scientometrics,2019-11-01,Michigan State University;Elsevier B.V.,Africa ;  Bibliometrics ;  International research collaboration ;  Internationalization ;  Metrics ;  Research management
Endothelialization of cardiovascular devices,"Blood-contacting surfaces of cardiovascular devices are not biocompatible for creating an endothelial layer on them. Numerous research studies have mainly sought to modify these surfaces through physical, chemical and biological means to ease early endothelial cell (EC) adhesion, migration and proliferation, and eventually to build an endothelial layer on the surfaces. The first priority for surface modification is inhibition of protein adsorption that leads to inhibition of platelet adhesion to the device surfaces, which may favor EC adhesion. Surface modification through surface texturing, if applicable, can bring some hopeful outcomes in this regard. Surface modifications through chemical and/or biological means may play a significant role in easy endothelialization of cardiovascular devices and inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation. Cellular engineering of cells relevant to endothelialization can boost the positive outcomes obtained through surface engineering. This review briefly summarizes recent developments and research in early endothelialization of cardiovascular devices. Statement of Significance: Endothelialization of cardiovascular implants, including heart valves, vascular stents and vascular grafts is crucial to solve many problems in our health care system. Numerous research efforts have been made to improve endothelialization on the surfaces of cardiovascular implants, mainly through surface modifications in three ways – physically, chemically and biologically. This review is intended to highlight comprehensive research studies to date on surface modifications aiming for early endothelialization on the blood-contacting surfaces of cardiovascular implants. It also discusses future perspectives to help guide endothelialization strategies and inspire further innovations.",Jana S.,Journal,Acta Biomaterialia,2019-11-01,University of Missouri,Cardiovascular ;  Endothelialization ;  Heart valve ;  Vascular graft ;  Vascular stent
Robotic autonomous systems for earthmoving in military applications,"Along with increasing innovations in frontier engineering sciences, the advancement in Robotic Autonomous Systems (RAS) has brought about a new horizon in earthmoving processes for construction. In the military domain, there is also an increasing interest in utilising RAS technologies. In particular, ground-based forces are frequently called upon to conduct earthmoving tasks as part of military operations, tasks which could be partially or fully aided by the employment of RAS technologies. There have been rapid developments in military construction automation using high-mobility ground-based platforms, human-machine and machine-machine interfaces, teleoperation and control systems, data transmission systems, machine perception and manipulation capabilities, as well as advances in networked robotics and cyberphysical systems. Given these developments it is timely to undertake a comprehensive overview on the topic of interest to the research community and the authority. This paper presents an overview of the RAS development for platform-centric earthworks together with an analysis of the technical feasibility, maturity, key technical challenges, and future directions for the application of RAS technologies to earthmoving tasks of interest to the army.",Ha Q.; Yen L.; Balaguer C.,Journal,Automation in Construction,2019-11-01,University of Technology Sydney;Defence Science and Technology Group;Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,Military earthmoving ;  Mode of control ;  Robotic autonomous systems ;  Technology/system readiness
Leveraging creativity in requirements elicitation within agile software development: A systematic literature review,"Agile approaches tend to focus solely on scoping and simplicity rather than on problem solving and discovery. This hampers the development of innovative solutions. Additionally, little has been said about how to capture and represent the real user needs. To fill this gap, some authors argue in favor of the application of “Creative thinking” for requirements elicitation within agile software development. This synergy between creativeness and agility has arisen as a new means of bringing innovation and flexibility to increasingly demanding software. The aim of the present study is therefore to employ a systematic review to investigate the state-of-the-art of those approaches that leverage creativity in requirements elicitation within Agile Software Development, as well as the benefits, limitations and strength of evidence of these approaches. The review was carried out by following the guidelines proposed by Dr. Kitchenham. The search strategy identified 1451 studies, 17 of which were eventually classified as primary studies. The selected studies contained 13 different and unique proposals. These approaches provide evidence that enhanced creativity in requirements elicitation can be successfully implemented in real software projects. We specifically observed that projects related to user interface development, such as those for mobile or web applications, are good candidates for the use of these approaches. We have also found that agile methodologies such as Scrum, Extreme Programming or methodologies based on rapid modelling are preferred when introducing creativity into requirements elicitation. Despite this being a new research field, there is a mixture of techniques, tools and processes that have already been and are currently being successfully tested in industry. Finally, we have found that, although creativity is an important ingredient with which to bring about innovation, it is not always sufficient to generate new requirements because this needs to be followed by user engagement and a specific context in which proper conditions, such as flexibility, time or resources, have to be met.",Aldave A.; Vara J.; Granada D.; Marcos E.,Journal,Journal of Systems and Software,2019-11-01,Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,Agile methodologies ;  Creative thinking ;  Requirements elicitation ;  Software development ;  Software project management ;  Systematic review
Does the path of technological progress matter in mitigating China's PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations? Evidence from three urban agglomerations in China,"Technological progress is widely considered to play an important role in reducing air pollution. While growing literature has explored the effects of technological progress on environmental quality, fewer studies have considered the varied effects exerted by different technological progress paths on PM2.5 concentrations. This paper explored the relationship between two different kinds of technological progress (indigenous innovation and technology diffusion) and PM2.5 concentrations. Indigenous innovation was in this study considered to be composed by research and development investment (R&D) and import technology (IM); technology diffusion was represented by foreign direction investment (FDI) and export learning effect represent (EX). A panel data model was employed in order to explore the varied impact of these different technological progress paths on PM2.5 concentrations, using data for 48 cities located in China's three most developed urban agglomerations (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Pearl River Delta), for the period 2000–2015. The results reveal that without control variables, FDI had a significant negative impact on PM2.5 levels in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, and EX a significant positive impact. FDI, R&D, and EX were found to positively correlate with PM2.5 levels in the Yangtze River Delta. In Pearl River Delta, R&D presented a significant negative relationship. The findings of this study provide decision makers and industry managers with a scientific basis from which to approach the task of mitigating PM2.5 concentrations through technological progress. The purpose of this study is to reveal the varied effects exerted by different technological progress paths on PM2.5 concentrations in China's three most developed urban agglomerations.",Chen J.; Wang S.; Zhou C.; Li M.,Journal,Environmental Pollution,2019-11-01,Massachusetts Institute of Technology;Sun Yat-Sen University;Fujian Normal University;Xinjiang University,Air pollution ;  Indigenous innovation ;  Regional variations ;  Technology diffusion
Quantile forecasting based on a bivariate hysteretic autoregressive model with GARCH errors and time -varying correlations,"To understand and predict chronological dependence in the second-order moments of asset returns, this paper considers a multivariate hysteretic autoregressive (HAR) model with generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) specification and time-varying correlations, by providing a new method to describe a nonlinear dynamic structure of the target time series. The hysteresis variable governs the nonlinear dynamics of the proposed model in which the regime switch can be delayed if the hysteresis variable lies in a hysteresis zone. The proposed setup combines three useful model components for modeling economic and financial data: (1) the multivariate HAR model, (2) the multivariate hysteretic volatility models, and (3) a dynamic conditional correlation structure. This research further incorporates an adapted multivariate Student t innovation based on a scale mixture normal presentation in the HAR model to tolerate for dependence and different shaped innovation components. This study carries out bivariate volatilities, Value at Risk, and marginal expected shortfall based on a Bayesian sampling scheme through adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, thus allowing to statistically estimate all unknown model parameters and forecasts simultaneously. Lastly, the proposed methods herein employ both simulated and real examples that help to jointly measure for industry downside tail risk.",Chen C.; Than-Thi H.; So M.; Sriboonchitta S.,Journal,Applied Stochastic Models in Business and Industry,2019-11-01,Ton-Duc-Thang University;Hong Kong University of Science and Technology;Feng Chia University;Chiang Mai University,hysteresis ;  marginal expected shortfall ;  Markov chain Monte Carlo method ;  multivariate student t distribution ;  out-of-sample forecasting ;  scale mixture of normal distributions ;  value at risk
Dealing with intellectual property (IP) landmines: Defensive measures to address the problem of IP access,"Intellectual property (IP) rights have become an important strategic battleground, in which IP owners increasingly build barriers that impede firms from operating in the marketplace. Although research has examined property preemption as one approach to defend against being blocked by others’ IP, a broader palette of defensive IP measures to address problems of missing access to external IP has received less scrutiny. In quantitative analyses of a representative survey of German firms, we find that key firm-level attributes—firm scope, innovation expenses, product innovation, collaboration breadth, and use of patents—are associated with a need to use such defensive IP measures. We also examine the firm-level attributes associated with a firm's choice among eight possible types of strategies for IP defense, and how certain types of defensive IP measures are systematically interrelated in use. Qualitative interviews with seventeen intellectual property practitioners complement, and help to interpret, our quantitative findings. Implications for future research, and for managers and policymakers are discussed.",Chung J.; Lorenz A.; Somaya D.,Journal,Research Policy,2019-11-01,"Gies College of Business;The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen;Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development;Technische Universität Berlin",Defensive measures ;  Freedom to innovate ;  Intellectual property ;  IP access problem ;  Strategy
Interdisciplinarity in New Product Development in an Indian MedTech Perspective: Gap and the Solution,"The medical device industry is a niche field globally and among the fastest growing industries in India. It requires specialised and interdisciplinary skills, as well as knowledge for innovation of new product development. New product development has four key phases: need finding, concept generation, engineering and validation. The first two phases require broad vertical and lateral thinking to come up with innovative plus appropriate solutions. Thus, multidisciplinary teams made up of experienced individuals with interdisciplinary knowledge enhance the phase outputs. The next two phases are iterative, usually requiring management of multiple subsystems, across technical disciplines and system integration. Without interdisciplinary product members and technical leaders, product development is not optimised. This leads to numerous iterations - loss of time, money. The industry struggles to find these interdisciplinary resources and building this capacity today takes a decade in India, with the entire burden falling on the industry. In well-developed medical device markets, higher education has introduced application-centric courses with cross-disciplinary curriculums. Such a structure allows students to gain valuable skills and understanding of the industry as a whole. Developed ecosystems have no shortage of experts available who serve as technical leaders. Developing countries like India have a very young indigenous medical device industry. In such nations, private companies struggle to find experienced individuals capable of interdisciplinary thinking and problem-solving. In this paper, we present India’s current Medtech perspective, and the industry member’s experiences through case studies and interviews.

"From fading novelty effects to emergent appreciation of Activity-based Flexible Offices: Comparing the individual, organisational and spatial adaptations in two case organisations","Activity-based Flexible Offices (AFOs) are innovations in workspace design that have been increasingly implemented in organisations in recent years. There are conflicting research results on the long-term consequences of implementing AFOs. This paper investigates the changes (if any) that occur over time, in: 1) employee satisfaction with AFO solutions and perceived work support, 2) ways of working and using AFOs and 3) the AFO solution. Two organisations participated in the study. The data collection involved: (i) semi-structured interviews with 26 employees and (ii) process enquiries involving the collection of secondary data and interviews with facility management teams. The findings indicate that limited options for improving an AFO solution lead to lingering work environment problems. By contrast, modifying the solution through systematic processes based on employee feedback helped resolving the initial problems. Over time, this led to an increased appreciation and a sense of collective ownership of the AFO solution.",Babapour M.,Journal,Applied Ergonomics,2019-11-01,Chalmers University of Technology,Activity-based working (ABW) ;  Occupational health and safety (OHS) ;  Work environment
"Valorization of mangosteen, “The Queen of Fruits,” and new advances in postharvest and in food and engineering applications: A review","One of the most prolific plants utilized in various applications is mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana L.). Rich in potent bioactive compounds, such as xanthones, mangosteen is known to possess pharmacologically important anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor properties. However, most previous reviews have only discussed the application of mangosteen in medicinal areas, yet more recent studies have diverged and valorized its usage in other scientific fields. In this review, the utilization of this exotic fruit in postharvest biology (phytohormone roles, metabolite profiling, bioactive compounds, isolation method optimization, chemical contaminant identification, and management of pests and fruit disorders), food science (food products, animal feed supplementation, and food shelf-life determination), and engineering fields (fabric and solar cell dyes, carbon dots, activated carbon, and biomedical advanced materials) is presented in detail. Research papers published from 2016 onward were selected and reviewed to show the recent research trends in these areas. In conclusion, mangosteen has been utilized for various purposes, ranging from usage in industrially important products to applications in advanced technologies and biomedical innovation.",Aizat W.; Ahmad-Hashim F.; Syed Jaafar S.,Journal,Journal of Advanced Research,2019-11-01,Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,Anthocyanin ;  Bioactivity ;  Flavonoid ;  Manggis ;  Mangostin ;  Xanthone
Stronger together—A framework for measuring interdisciplinary understanding,"Our society currently faces complex ecological, social, and economic challenges that require collaborative and interdisciplinary approaches. Although interest in interdisciplinary research is growing, it is still confronted with significant obstacles stemming from difficulties in establishing a common understanding. While others have evaluated interdisciplinary in a top-down funding-oriented ex ante manner or a result-oriented ex post manner, this focus paper intends to create a framework that enables the measurement of interdisciplinary understanding within a group. Therefore, using the case of the interdisciplinary Boysen-TU Dresden Research Group, a framework for measuring interdisciplinary understanding (MIU) is presented. The basis of the framework is the development of dimensions based on the specific composition and requirements of the interdisciplinary group. With this framework, two main contributions are provided. First, interdisciplinary understanding within a research group can be measured with respect to the defined dimensions. Through discussions on the differences of the understanding of projects over the dimensions, it is possible to establish a common understanding of projects. Second, the interdisciplinarity within a group or interdisciplinary distance between two specific research projects can be evaluated in order to identify possible difficulties in understanding, as well as recognizing potentials for interdisciplinary research. The MIU framework and the dimensions established in this paper can be adapted and transferred to any interdisciplinary research group to improve joint understanding of researchers and enable them to tackle complex techno-societal problems of the future.

Creativity in Electrical Engineering Degree Programs: Where Is the Content?,"Contribution: This paper demonstrated on a large scale that explicit articulation of creativity-related learning goals on engineering syllabi is quite limited, and primarily limited to the first year of study. Engineering educators may need to do more to ensure creativity is explicitly addressed as an expected learning outcome within engineering syllabi. Background: Prior studies have shown inclusion of creativity within engineering syllabi and course activities are generally limited. Students may perceive educators do not value creativity, and their studies have limited influence on their creative skills. Studies conflict on whether creativity skills increase over completing an engineering degree. Creativity has been demonstrated to be an important skill for engineering professionals, but one not necessarily appropriately addressed in engineering programs. Few studies have attempted to quantify coverage of creativity material on a nation-wide scale, as opposed to in a single or select few institutions. Research Questions: 1) To what extent do engineering educators explicitly articulate creativity and innovation-related learning goals and material on their course syllabi? and 2) To what extent do engineering educators explicitly articulate exposure to, or instruction in the use of, creativity heuristics within their course syllabi? Methodology: The online publicly accessible course outlines of 1109 compulsory courses from 42 degree programs accredited by two national engineering accreditation bodies were qualitatively analyzed in a two-stage approach using document analysis. Findings: Approximately 2% of compulsory electrical engineering course outlines explicitly articulate creativity-related material; only one course articulated engaging students in using creativity heuristics.",Valentine A.; Belski I.; Hamilton M.; Adams S.,Journal,IEEE Transactions on Education,2019-11-01,The University of Western Australia;Deakin University;RMIT University,Creativity ;  electrical engineering ;  engineering curriculum ;  innovation ;  undergraduate
"Studying transitions: Past, present, and future","The domain of transition studies has been drawing more and more scholarly attention and, as a result, its body of knowledge is rapidly growing. This raises new challenges as well as opportunities, not the least regarding the methodological and philosophical underpinnings of research in this domain. In this respect, transition research, as a relatively young field of inquiry, has been little concerned with methodological investigation and reflection. We propose a framework that enables this reflection: the so-called ‘transition research onion’. Subsequently, we utilize this framework to systematically assess 217 peer-reviewed papers in the field of transition studies, to distill key methodological patterns and trends of the field. The findings suggest that the methodology of transition studies, in terms of depth and diversity, is underdeveloped. These insights serve to guide future research on transition processes.",Zolfagharian M.; Walrave B.; Raven R.; Romme A.,Journal,Research Policy,2019-11-01,Technische Universiteit Eindhoven;Monash University;Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development,Innovation studies ;  Research methods ;  Systematic review ;  Transition studies ;  Transitions
"Cybersecurity and Privacy Issues in Brazil: Back, Now, and Then [Guest Editors' Introduction]","The goal of this special issue is to showcase cutting-edge research on security and privacy issues in Brazil, with a focus on topics that reflect Brazil's unique security and privacy challenges. Why Brazil? First, Brazil is the largest country in Latin America, with more than 200 million people. It is the fifth largest and the sixth most populous country in the world, with a rapidly developing economy (the world's eighth richest). Brazil is also a major player in cybersecurity. Further, Brazil's capabilities in cybersecurity have grown in the past several years, as reflected by a recent joint government- and academia-led pair of workshops involving the security communities of Brazil and the US (www.usbrazilsec.org) as well as a US-Brazil program funded by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Brazilian Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communication (MCTIC). Many peculiarities and challenges related to cybersecurity and privacy are unique to Brazil and so warrant special attention from the international cybersecurity community because of their potential to inform future global cybersecurity initiatives.",Seabra Oliveira D.; Epstein J.; Kurose J.; Rocha A.,Journal,IEEE Security and Privacy,2019-11-01,Universidade Estadual de Campinas;University of Massachusetts Amherst;University of Florida;National Science Foundation,
Applying participatory design to a pharmacy system intervention,"Background: Stakeholder engagement is an important component of the research process for improving the use and uptake of patient-centered health care innovations. Participatory design (PD), a method that utilizes the involvement of patients and other stakeholders, is well-suited for the design of multifaceted interventions in complex work systems, such as community pharmacies, that have diverse and dynamic end-users. Objective: The objective is to describe a blueprint for how to use PD when designing a community pharmacy intervention. This paper outlines the steps of PD and highlights the advantages and disadvantages of this method. Methods: PD is explained step-wise to underscore the considerations required of researchers unfamiliar with PD. This includes the development of a tailored PD approach, PD session preparatory work, data collection, and intervention development and evaluation. The stakeholders recruited for the community pharmacy intervention were pharmacy staff and older adult patients who received prescriptions at the pharmacy corporation in which the intervention was being implemented. The PD process was a series of six adaptive sessions: (1) problem identification, (2) solution generation, (3) convergence, (4) prototyping, (5) initial evaluation, and (6) formative evaluation. Results: A description of the PD process to design a community pharmacy intervention is provided. The process led to the development of a patient-centered prototype. The advantages of using PD included the opportunity to clarify problems faced by stakeholders, generation of novel solutions to incorporate into the intervention, and the ability to vet and fine-tune stakeholder design ideas in an iterative fashion. The insight gained was unprecedented and invaluable to the researchers. The biggest challenge of employing PD was the time-sensitive and time-intensive nature of developing each session, collecting data, and reflecting on the results in order to design subsequent sessions. Conclusions: The PD process led to the development of a patient-centered prototype. PD enabled stakeholders to generate creative solutions and provide unique insight on addressing issues faced in healthcare redesign research and specifically in community pharmacies.",Reddy A.; Lester C.; Stone J.; Holden R.; Phelan C.; Chui M.,Journal,Research in Social and Administrative Pharmacy,2019-11-01,"University of Wisconsin-Madison;University of Michigan, Ann Arbor;Indiana University School of Medicine;University of Wisconsin–Madison School of Nursing",Community pharmacy ;  Dissemination and implementation ;  Human factors engineering ;  Medication safety ;  Participatory design ;  System redesign
The Role of Innovation Ecosystems and Social Capital in Startup Survival,"Innovation ecosystems, including technology parks and incubators, endeavor to achieve a high density of startups that is rich in social capital to help tenants evolve. Given the importance of social capital on startup success and the opportunity for social capital diffusion in high-density ecosystems, the inconclusive impact of ecosystems on firm performance warrants further attention. We present a startup survival model that distinguishes between access to social capital and using it. Empirical tests with the longitudinal Kauffman Firm Survey find that those startups that use social capital by collaborating with other agents (universities, industries, and government organizations) significantly outperform startups that do not. However, we also observe that the amount of social capital available in an ecosystem counterintuitively does not correlate with a tenant's use of it, and correlates weakly with longer life expectancy. These results are moderated by whether the tenant is a high-tech startup or not. Findings contribute to extant research in innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystems. Policy and pedagogical recommendations for leveraging an ecosystem to improve firm performance and achieve the ultimate goal of regional economic development are discussed.",Bandera C.; Thomas E.,Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2019-11-01,New Jersey Institute of Technology,Entrepreneurship ;  innovation ecosystem ;  social capital ;  startup collaboration ;  startup firms ;  survival analysis
Deployment Strategies for Service Innovation,"In large organizations, local use of innovations is not enough; extracting the full use of the innovation requires deployment across the organization. The purpose of this paper is to explore strategies for the deployment of service innovations and factors influencing success. We adopt an inductive theory-building approach with a longitudinal embedded case study of ten successful service innovations. We find two deployment strategies: Required adoption, in which subsidiaries are required to adopt innovations, and voluntary adoption, in which adoption is not compulsory-innovations are showcased, but the adoption decision is left to the subsidiaries. We have investigated the factors influencing deployment, including the decentralized nature of service innovation, fit with the internal and external context, extrinsic and intrinsic motivations, and handovers. Based on analyses of case evidence, we put forward research propositions accordingly. This study provides managerial guidance for multidivisional organizations to extract full value from service innovations. Although some results may be particular to the Chinese context, research in other contexts can broaden the generalizability of the findings.",Wang Q.; Voss C.; Zhao X.,Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2019-11-01,Warwick Business School;China Europe International Business School;Xi'an Jiaotong University,Deployment strategies ;  innovation diffusion ;  longitudinal case study ;  multidivisional organizations ;  service innovation
Competition and Complementation of Exploration and Exploitation and the Achievement of Radical Innovation: The Moderating Effect of Learning Behavior and Promotion Focus,"We aim to address inconsistencies in the research literature on whether exploration and exploitation compete with or complement each other in their effect on radically innovative team outcomes. This study takes into consideration the moderating effect of team learning behavior, which includes seeking or providing feedback, sharing information and elaborating task-relevant information, and team promotion focus, which refers to the motivation for innovation. Using results obtained from 108 research and development teams from six high-tech organizations, our findings show two ways to achieve radical innovation performance. Both are characterized by a high level of exploration; however, the level of exploitation and of learning behavior in each of them is either high or low. Against our expectations, promotion focus does not modify the effect of exploration and exploitation on radical innovation performance. While promotion focus is usually assumed to be positively associated with team innovation, we counterintuitively show that when the level of exploration is high, a low (compared to high) level of promotion focus leads to increased radical innovation.",Blank T.; Naveh E.,Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2019-11-01,Jerusalem School of Business Administration;Technion - Israel Institute of Technology,Exploitation ;  exploration ;  learning behavior ;  prevention focus ;  promotion focus ;  radical innovation ;  research and development (R&D) teams
Generative Capability,"How do firms leverage existing innovations for the next round of innovations? We develop a novel concept of generative capability in product innovation to address this question. Generative capability applies the mechanisms of iteration and rapid knowledge integration to guide innovation activities. Based on panel data from 2001 to 2009 of 56 344 manufacturing firm-year observations in China, we find that institutional complexity and internationalization are positively related to generative capability, that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have lower levels of generative capability than do firms with other ownership structures, and that generative capability improves firms' performance significantly. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of generative capability for theoretical development and point to a number of fruitful areas for future research.",Sun S.; Zou B.,Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2019-11-01,University of Massachusetts Lowell;Harbin Institute of Technology,Generativity ;  institutional complexity ;  iteration ;  product innovation
Social studies preservice teachers' experience of technology integration (Qualitative research in UPI Campus Sumedang),"This research examined preservice teacher's experiences of technology integration in social studies as a subjects in curriculum. We recognize school-based technology integration and implementation processes are influenced by a complex ecology of people. There are abundant ways social studies students can make social studies enjoyable and meaningful to students. As an interdisciplinary subject, social studies draws upon multiple curricular contents related to the social sciences. With increased innovation and technological developments, access becomes a concern. Campuses expecting technological fluency and seamless integration into the classroom must also admit that there are students with limited skills and exposure. This study will explore which students as preservice teachers are using technology and how technology is shaping their college experiences, also able to use technology creatively to facilitate their work, expand their instructional strategies, and improve social studies teaching. This study suggests that technology indeed offered social studies student a unique opportunity to enhance social studies instruction. Further, they can have incorporated technology into the social studies curricula in many and varied ways. Use of technology made it possible for them to conduct learning activities that both increased students' interest in social studies and improved their problem solving ability and higher order thinking skills.",Hanifah N.; Isrokatun I.; Aeni A.,Conference Proceeding,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,2019-10-31,Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia,

Grand challenges in the science of wind energy,"Harvested by advanced technical systems honed over decades of research and development, wind energy has become a mainstream energy resource. However, continued innovation is needed to realize the potential of wind to serve the global demand for clean energy. Here, we outline three interdependent, cross-disciplinary grand challenges underpinning this research endeavor. The first is the need for a deeper understanding of the physics of atmospheric flow in the critical zone of plant operation. The second involves science and engineering of the largest dynamic, rotating machines in the world. The third encompasses optimization and control of fleets of wind plants working synergistically within the electricity grid. Addressing these challenges could enable wind power to provide as much as half of our global electricity needs and perhaps beyond.",Veers P.; Dykes K.; Lantz E.; Barth S.; Bottasso C.; Carlson O.; Clifton A.; Green J.; Green P.; Holttinen H.; Laird D.; Lehtomäki V.; Lundquist J.; Manwell J.; Marquis M.; Meneveau C.; Moriarty P.; Munduate X.; Muskulus M.; Naughton J.; Pao L.; Paquette J.; Peinke J.; Robertson A.; Rodrigo J.; Sempreviva A.; Smith J.; Tuohy A.; Wiser R.,Journal,Science,2019-10-25,"Centro Nacional de Energías Renovables (CENER);College of Engineering and Applied Science;College of Engineering;Whiting School of Engineering;National Renewable Energy Laboratory;College of Engineering and Physical Sciences;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration;Universität Oldenburg;Technische Universität München;Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet;Technical University of Denmark;Sandia National Laboratories, New Mexico;Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory;Electric Power Research Institute, Inc;Chalmers University of Technology;University of Colorado Boulder;Recognis Oy;Energy Systems Integration Group;WindForS - Wind Energy Research Cluster;Kjeller Vindteknikk;ForWind - Center for Wind Energy Research",
Critical Points in the Formation and Implementation System of the Fundamental Science and Technology Innovations Life Cycle,"Issues of developing and implementing fundamental science and technology innovations is particularly relevant in current times due to the escalation of qualitatively new problems of the socio-economic development of society. However, their analysis has a predominantly descriptive form of separate stages, processes, and procedures, and is not formed on the framework of clear criteria and indicators. Fundamental science and technology innovations, based on qualitatively new physical principles, make it possible to significantly increase the efficiency of the whole social production and the social spheres of society. The life cycle of fundamental science and technology innovations is a structurally and functionally complex integrated system which includes the birth of ideas for future innovative products, the process of their materialization, material realization, and later, the operation and disposal processes due to the depletion of their consumer properties. This study determines the critical points in the system of forming and implementing the life cycle of fundamental science and technology innovations as a single integrated process in the form of specific indicator gauges. These points determine the time parameters and characteristics of the life cycle of the fundamental scientific and technological innovations, its efficiency and quality. Future products start to become obsolete the moment the idea of them is generated. The authors conceptually determined that the process of a scientifically novel idea becoming obsolete can be described by an exponential curve. This is presented in the corresponding graph. The authors determined the life cycle stages of the fundamental scientific and technological innovations and established that the pre-production stage presents an opportunity to use combination effects during two or more stages of the life cycle and to use iteration procedures. This creates new possibilities for raising the efficiency and quality of the life cycle, contributing to a significant reduction in the level of various kinds of risks.

Modern management tools for sustainable development of mining enterprises,"The production growth rates, the generated volumes of waste by classes of hazard, an extent of fuel and energy resources and fresh water used for coal mining, as well as the volumes of pollutant emissions into the atmosphere of Ukrainian mining enterprises have been analyzed. It has been found that achieving the decoupling (reduction of anthropogenic load) is only possible under the condition of introducing the cleaner production technologies, non-waste technologies, innovations, replacement of obsolete capital funds, and the like. Mere changes in points will not significantly affect the situation, thus, companies should develop their own approach to the sustainable development by using the frameworks as templates. The calculations have been made of the decoupling phenomenon based on the volumes of emission, the volumes of generated waste by classes of hazard and used fuel and water resources, which showed an increased anthropogenic environmental impact and economic imbalance of the mining sector. The research has been made into the use of frameworks as an auxiliary tool for the implementation by mining companies of sustainable development principles.

A mind model for intelligent machine innovation using future thinking principles,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to address the possible future evolution of innovation from a human-only initiative, to human–machine co-innovation, to autonomous machine innovation and to arrive at a conceptual mind model that outlines the role of innovation regimes and innovation agents. Design/methodology/approach: This is a concept paper where a theoretical “thought experiment” is done, using future thinking principles and data that originate from the literature. Findings: A conceptual mind model is developed to facilitate a better understanding of complexity at the edge of innovation where intelligent machines will emerge as innovators of the cyber world. It was found that innovation will gradually evolve from a human-only activity, to human–machine co-innovation, to incidences of autonomous machine innovation, based on the growth of machine intelligence and the adoption of human–machine partnership management models in future. Research limitations/implications: Very little information is available in the literature on intelligent machines doing innovation. The work is based on a theoretical approach that presents new concepts to be debated, but have not been tested in engineering and technology management practice, except for a conference presentation and academic discussion. Practical implications: The current world view is that future “smartness” is only possible through the creative abilities that humans have, but as machines are entering the workplace and our daily lives, not only as static robots on a manufacturing line, but as intelligent systems with the potential to replace lawyers and accountants, doctors and teachers, companions and partners, their role in innovation in complex environments needs to be explored. Social implications: Human–machine interaction is often an emotional social issue of concern in terms of the replacement of human intelligence with machine intelligence. It should be asked whether humans will or should remain in control of innovation? Artificial intelligence (AI) may complement and even substitute human intelligence, but huge value is embedded in the new goods, services and innovations AI will enable, especially in manufacturing, where value embedded in the project becomes complex and dynamic. Originality/value: The thinking presented in this paper is original and should lead to debate to question the way innovation systems will work in future and inspires thinking about AI and innovation.",Botha A.,Journal,Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management,2019-10-22,University of Pretoria;TechnoScene (Pty) Ltd,Artificial intelligence ;  Automation ;  Complexity ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Innovation ;  Robotics
Business model innovation in small- and medium-sized enterprises: Strategies for industry 4.0 providers and users,"Purpose: Industry 4.0 is expected to significantly transform industrial value creation. However, research on business models affected through Industry 4.0, and on small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), remains scarce. In response, the purpose of this paper is to address both aspects, further elaborating on the role that SMEs can take toward Industry 4.0 as provider or user. Design/methodology/approach: The paper used an exploratory research design based on 43 in-depth expert interviews within the three most important German industry sectors, mechanical and plant engineering, electrical engineering and automotive suppliers. Interviews were conducted with leading personnel of the respective enterprises, including 22 CEOs. They assign business model implications through Industry 4.0, referring to the Business Model Canvas, while the paper delineates between Industry 4.0 providers and users. Findings: The paper finds that key resources and value proposition are among the most affected elements of the business model, whereas channels are the least affected. Furthermore, distinct characteristics between Industry 4.0 providers and users can be delineated. In general, Industry 4.0 providers’ business models are significantly more affected than users, except for key partners and customer relationships. Research limitations/implications: Industry 4.0 remains at its early stages of implementation. As a result, many interviewees’ answers remain at a rather general level. Practical implications: Strategies for the further alignment of the business models are provided for Industry 4.0 providers and users. Originality/value: The paper is among the few that investigate Industry 4.0 in the context of SMEs and business models.",Müller J.,Journal,Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management,2019-10-22,Fachhochschule Salzburg,Case studies ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Manufacturing industry ;  Small- and medium-sized enterprises
Optimal strategy for enterprises’ green technology innovation from the perspective of political competition,"Different local governments engage in strategic interactions when they compete for resources to promote regional economic development under the background of ‘political tournaments’. Although many scholars have studied the impact of political competition among local governments on the environmental governance effect, they have paid less attention to the internal mechanism of the environmental benefits arising from political competition. Under the two scenarios of considering and not considering political competition, this paper uses Stackelberg game theory and optimization theory to analyse enterprises' optimal green technology innovation strategies. In addition, the impact of key factors is analysed based on the decision-making modes of cost-sharing and revenue-sharing, without cost-sharing and revenue-sharing, and centralized decision-making. This paper draws the following main conclusions: (1) Considering the influence of political competition, the optimal green technology innovation strategies of local governments and enterprises differ for different modes. (2) Political competition not only directly affects enterprises' optimal level of green technology innovation but also indirectly affects it by influencing the optimal investment ratio of environmental governance. The inverted U-shaped relationship between political competition and enterprises' optimal level of green technology innovation is related to the incentive coefficient of local government investment behaviour set by the central government. Controlling for the relative size of the incentive coefficient of local government investment in environmental governance and economic development can promote the positive impact of political competition on enterprises' optimal level of green technology innovation. (3) The decision-making mode of enterprises and local governments and environmental decentralization have significant effects on the optimal level of green technology innovation, which should be considered when the central government formulates effective environmental policies.",Deng Y.; You D.; Wang J.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2019-10-20,Central South University,Environmental decentralization ;  Green technology innovation ;  Political competition ;  Stackelberg game theory
Oxygen Defects and Surface Chemistry of Reducible Oxides,"The magic reducible oxides properties likely are mainly due to the presence of oxygen defects and their rich surface chemistry, which provide a rational pathway to the emergent of entirely new properties.

Theoretical and methodological proposal on the development of critical thinking through mathematical modeling in the training of engineers,"The present work constitutes a research advance, which takes up previous work where the teaching of Mathematics in higher education is modified through experimentation in the classroom using the modeling of real phenomena and / or simulation. The idea is to rethink Mathematical modeling as a didactic strategy that aims to develop not only disciplinary but also transversal competencies such as Critical Thinking. A review of ideas around Critical Thinking is shown, and this is intended to show that Mathematical modeling can help develop this competency in the Mathematics classroom. A theoretical proposal of how we conceive Mathematical modeling and methodological proposals is presented along with elements to look at these processes in the classroom.

Mathematical Modeling in the Educational Field: A Systematic Literature Review,"For more than forty years, mathematical modeling has assumed great importance in the educational field. The growing interest in modeling is related to students' need to understand and use mathematics in daily life and the ineffectiveness of traditional mathematics teaching to achieve success. This strategy of focusing on real-world problems and bringing them to the world of mathematics so they can be solved has evolved from the increased interest in modeling. Based on several studies, researchers say that the method of teaching mathematics to students promotes and maintains the motivation for their learning and the study of professional careers related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of a literature review on mathematical modeling in the educational field. Information was obtained about authors with the greatest number of publications on the subject, the most cited articles, the journals with the greatest number of publications, and the types of participants in the studies analyzed. Classifications of the research articles reviewed were done in accordance with the theoretical perspectives of mathematical modeling and with their purpose in mathematics education. A total of 70 articles were analyzed from which it was found that 50% of the studies start with a theoretical educational theoretical perspective; the use of modeling as a vehicle to teach Mathematics was found in 96% of the studies; the other 4% consider modeling as a purpose.",Gutiérrez J.; Gallegos R.,Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2019-10-16,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Educational innovation ;  Mathematical modeling ;  Modeling perspectives ;  Systematic literature review ;  Teaching of mathematics

Technique to evaluate the thermoregulatory capacity before thermal stress. Application case of thermographic images to blood flow monitoring,"In order to improve the acquisition of skills in nursing and physiotherapy, a new learning methodology is presented. To this end, a laboratory practice based on the combination of thermographic technologies and clinical practice is shown. The thermographic images are used for the evaluation of the thermoregulatory system of the hands, with particular emphasis on Raynaud's syndrome or phenomenon. In Raynaud's syndrome, alterations in surface temperature occur in peripheral regions such as the hands. In this methodological practice, thermographic information is evaluated to observe the physiological response to thermal stress, information that can be handled by students via e-learning. It is a protocol model of thermal stress by immersing hands in cold water. The present work is related to the application of infrared technology that can be used not only for the acquisition of practical skills, but also for the evaluation of competencies in the area of health sciences. In this practical project the student is able to apply complex competences in the field that will be developed throughout their career in both clinical and / or research.",Rodríguez-Gonzálvez P.; Rodríguez-Martín M.; Rodríguez-Miró I.; Fernández-Iglesias S.; Bernal M.; Alvear-Ordenes I.,Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2019-10-16,Universidad de Salamanca;Universidad de León,Circulatory physiology ;  E-Learning ;  Educational innovation ;  Engineering ;  ICT ;  Thermography
Criteria for measuring Sustainable Construction Project Performance in Nigeria,"Construction Project (CP) in Nigeria is currently still at a rear end as far as sustainable construction is concerned. Consequently, the objective of this study is to identify criteria necessary for measuring sustainable construction project performance and to elicit perceptions of their relative importance. Thorough review of related studies were deployed to generate a set of factors that makes construction project habitable, attractive and liveable, and also, factors for measuring construction project performance. A total of 87 questionnaires were distributed to seven (7) main groups of project participants namely; client, project manager, architect, quantity surveyor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer and builder/civil/structural engineer who participated on nine (9) case study projects. The survey findings indicate that quality performance and productivity both with 81.6% of importance, innovation with 80.4% of importance, health and safety with 80.2% of importance and client's satisfaction with 80% of importance are the most important factors to consider while measuring sustainable construction project performance. For a construction project to be habitable, safety and incident risk, acoustic comfort and visual comfort are the most important factors to consider. When considering how attractive construction project should be, art in architecture, unique style, terrain choice and harmonious surrounding are the most important factors to consider. Also, when considering the liveability of a construction project, space efficiency, ventilation and public accessibility are the most important factors to consider. Finally, this research recommended that the factors listed above, are key factors to consider at the design stage of any construction project for both the designer and the regulatory agencies, and these factors are to be monitored throughout the construction process since they are vital in measuring the performance of any sustainable construction project to infer a more desirable and satisfactory sustainable building.",Sanmi O.; Ayodeji O.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,2019-10-16,"Federal University of Technology, Akure",

Innovative decoupling system for the seismic protection of masonry infill walls in reinforced concrete frames,"Reinforced concrete frame structures with masonry infills often exhibit serious damage after earthquake events, as the infills are generally installed without additional constructive measures in contact to the reinforced concrete frame. The masonry infills constructed in this way experience an unplanned interaction with the surrounding RC frame and thus become part of the horizontal load-bearing system with in-plane loading. This interaction combined with seismically induced loads perpendicular to the infill panel often leads to total collapses of the masonry infills and heavy damages to the RC frames. This fact was the motivation to develop an innovative system for decoupling the RC frame and the masonry infill with a special profile made of elastomeric cellular material within the collaborative European research project INSYSME (Innovative Systems for Earthquake Resistant Masonry Enclosures in Reinforced Concrete Buildings). The profile allows relative displacements between the RC frame and the masonry infill and serves at the same time as a support for out-of-plane loads. The article first explains the design and installation of the system and provides an overview of the load bearing capacities determined through small specimen tests on the system components. Subsequently, fundamental experimental investigations on traditional and decoupled RC frames infilled with high thermal insulating clay bricks for separate and combined in-plane ‬and out-of-plane loading are presented. Based on a detailed evaluation and comparison of the test results, the performance and effectiveness of the developed system are illustrated.",Marinković M.; Butenweg C.,Journal,Engineering Structures,2019-10-15,University of Belgrade;Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen,Decoupling ;  Earthquake ;  Infill masonry ;  INODIS ;  INSYSME ;  Isolating element ;  Reinforced concrete frame
Different impacts of export and import on carbon emissions across 7 ASEAN countries: A panel quantile regression approach,"ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) has contributed numerous carbon emissions during the phase of industrialization. This study mainly compares the different effects of export and import on CO2 emissions across 7 ASEAN countries over 1990–2017. In addition, we investigate how technological innovation affects carbon emissions. Stationary tests are conducted through cross section dependence, unit root of panel data, and Westerlund cointegration. The results of panel quantile regression show that export and import both have adverse effects on CO2 emissions. EKC is valid in these countries. Moreover, population size and energy intensity increase carbon emissions. In particular, technology innovation significantly reduces carbon emissions by augmenting energy efficiency. It is important to improve eco-innovation, and expand knowledge-intensive industries in ASEAN countries.",Salman M.; Long X.; Dauda L.; Mensah C.; Muhammad S.,Journal,Science of the Total Environment,2019-10-10,Jiangsu University,Energy intensity ;  Exports ;  Imports ;  Technology innovation
Smart product-service systems: A novel transdisciplinary sociotechnical paradigm,"The third-wave of IT competition have embraced a promising market of low cost, high performance smart, connected products (SCP). Owing to their unique capabilities, SCPs together with their generated smart services, as a solution bundle can fulfil the everchanging individual user’s needs. Meanwhile, manufacturers/service providers leverage massive user generated data and product sensed data via the Internet-of-Things (IoT) for evergreen design innovation. This emerging IT-driven transdisciplinary engineering paradigm is named Smart Product-Service Systems (Smart PSS), which is an ecosystem consisting of various stakeholders as the key players for open innovation (social aspect), intelligent systems as the infrastructure to enable smartness and connectedness (technical aspect), and digital servitization as the value proposition to make higher profits (business aspect). Though similar terminologies have been utilized to describe such paradigm, none of them emphasizes its transdisciplinary essence, as a sociotechnical system. Moreover, scarcely any work addresses its lifecycle perspectives for sustainability concerns. Aiming to fill these gaps, this research provides a fundamental basis of Smart PSS by summarizing typical works from technical, social, and business aspects, respectively. Furthermore, its lifecycle perspectives in a circular economy is depited to motivate more in-depth research in the near future.",Zheng P.; Wang Z.; Chen C.,Conference Proceeding,Advances in Transdisciplinary Engineering,2019-10-07,School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering;School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,Circular economy ;  Product-service systems ;  Smart product ;  Sociotechnical system ;  Value co-creation
Investigating the prospect of micro-energy generation in S.Anisatum Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs),"Energy is a requirement for daily existence and a necessity for driving all technology. Thus, indices for generating energy will always be a valid reason for research. It therefore stands to reason that; numerous experimental effort has been devoted to the quest of energy generation. This quest has witnessed a lot of progression, newer innovations being an improvement over older editions. Recent energy studies have shifted its focus from dominant monocrystalline silicon solar cells to organic material sources. This is in the wake of the high expenses incurred in installation of any silicon solar technology. Although the economy of scale applies to increased use of silicon panels, it does not delete the looming future threat of disposal of expired silicon solar panels. This brings to fore, a need for an energy substitute that possesses the salient attributes of monocrystalline silicon solar cells without the limitations. Amongst all the alternatives, the low cost and environmentally benign dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) has remained prominent. Other desirable characteristics of dye-sensitized solar cells is all-year availability of raw materials, capacity to perform under low diffuse light conditions, ability to withstand extreme conditions contrary to their silicon counterparts are sterling qualities which necessitate detailed enquiry into dye-sensitized solar technology. In spite of these excellent properties, wide adoption of DSCs is limited by its poor output efficiency relative to monocrystalline silicon solar cells. The significance of this research is thus to investigate optical spectral responses of S.Anisatum dye-sensitized solar cells with an objective to analyze its photovoltaic output and prospect for micro-energy production. Preliminary phytochemical analysis portends S.Anisatum dye as rich in phenols. UV/VIS spectroscopy reveals a porphyrin characteristic absorbance. This research corroborates previousstudies such as photovoltaic output of B.spectabilis DSCs to different electrolytes. The spectral responses revealed 0.065 mA, 140 mV, 5.32 X 10-6 W and 0.86 % respectively as Isc, Voc, Pmax and η highest output value. Although this result is comparatively low to monocrystalline silicon panels, it conforms with existing standard porphyrin efficiency. This study provides impetus for further studies of S.Anisatum DSCs co-sensitization with other dyes and finds application in modelling of material of synthetic origin.",Abodunrin T.; Emetere M.; Ajayi O.; Popoola A.; Uyor U.; Popoola O.,Conference Proceeding,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,2019-10-07,Covenant University;Tshwane University of Technology,
Radon Monitoring: Pathway to Environmental Sustainability,"One important dimension of environmental sustainability is the need to maintain ecosystem services critical to the human population. These services include providing food, shelter, and construction materials. It has been discovered that construction materials contain certain amount of radon. So humans are most susceptible to radon related problems because we spend at least one third of the day indoor. Maintaining environmental sustainability is crucial to attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Radon monitoring is essential in determining the actual level of exposure in buildings. The indoor radon concentration in Covenant University Centre for Research Innovation and Development (CUCRID) has been studied using RAD7 radon detector machine. The result fro the study revealed that the average cumulative radon concentration for the building is 16.15 Bqm-3 which is lower than the permissible recommended level. Hence, it can be concluded that the radon level in CUCRID building does not pose any risk level to the occupants therefore the environment is safe for workers.",Usikalu M.; Achuka J.; Onumejor C.; Akinpelu A.; Omeje M.,Conference Proceeding,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,2019-10-07,Covenant University,Covenant University ;  environmental sustainability ;  indoor ;  Radon concentration

Team-member exchange and innovative work behaviour: The role of psychological empowerment and creative self-efficacy,"Purpose: In the context of team's influence on its members, this paper aims to investigate the effects of team-member exchange (TMX) on members' innovative work behaviour (IWB). The current study presents a moderated mediation model and examines the mechanisms and conditions involved in TMX-IWB relationship. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative research methodology was adopted where 156 engineering and management students (grouped into 33 teams) were given a task in the form of an assignment to be completed in three weeks’ timeframe. Post task, perceptions about TMX and IWB of members were captured using a questionnaire and the innovative output of each team was assessed using multi-rater technique. Findings: Psychological empowerment fully mediates TMX’s effect on team member's IWB. Furthermore, the results indicate that creative self-efficacy moderates the mediated path from TMX to IWB via psychological empowerment. The mediating effect of psychological empowerment is stronger when creative self-efficacy of a team member is higher. Furthermore, the relation between group-level innovative behaviour and the team's innovative output has been established. Originality/value: The current research has contributed to the limited literature on team performance and management. This paper has uniquely investigated psychological empowerment in the context of TMX and IWB. The paper has encapsulated the theoretical and practical underpinnings of the mediated effect of psychological empowerment on team members' innovation-oriented behaviour.",Ghosh V.; Bharadwaja M.; Yadav S.; Kabra G.,Journal,International Journal of Innovation Science,2019-10-04,"Dr. S.

Formal-informal channels of university-industry knowledge transfer: the case of Australian business schools,"The transfer of knowledge between university and industry is a significant activity that is facilitated by government policy and incentives. Australian universities have a global reputation for excellence in research and training. However, the country’s low score in innovation ranking has prompted the government and industry bodies to emphasise the importance of and provide support to high-quality science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. We study the knowledge transfer practices of 10 Australian universities and provide insights into how these universities, and in particular the Business Schools, respond to the funding cuts faced by the university sector. We find that the universities use both formal (research centres, incubators, and contract-research and commercialisation) and informal channels (internships, mentoring, industry talks, transdisciplinary research platforms, collaborative Ph.D. programs, and industry training programs) to transfer knowledge with industry partners.",Dang Q.; Jasovska P.; Rammal H.; Schlenker K.,Journal,Knowledge Management Research and Practice,2019-10-02,UTS Business School,Australia ;  formal and informal channels ;  STEM ;  University-Industry knowledge transfer
Public policy and the university-industry R&D nexus,"This study addresses under-theorization of the Triple Helix hypothesis, which explains how public policies affect the production of basic science at universities and in governments and private firms, by presenting an economic model examining how public policies work to stimulate academic research and private firms’ R&D, and to enhance cooperation between private firms, governments and universities. More specifically, our model indicates which, and how, public policies related to past investments in science capital, stimulus of patenting efforts, innovation subsidies and regulation of researchers’ employment and compensation may lead to damped oscillations and the achievement of a stable equilibrium. Exploratory analysis employing NSF data on science and engineering doctorates and BLS data on oil and gas extraction employment not only supports some of the main features of our formal model, it is also consistent with both seminal and more recent research on the Triple Helix hypothesis.",Faria J.; Mixon F.; Upadhyaya K.,Journal,Knowledge Management Research and Practice,2019-10-02,University of New Haven;Florida Atlantic University;Columbus State University,incentives for academics ;  oil and gas extraction ;  Research cycles
From the science of learning (and development) to learning engineering,"In this issue, Cantor and colleagues synthesize a broad representation of the literature on the science of learning, and how learning changes over the course of development. Their perspective highlights three important factors about the emerging field of science of learning and development: (1) that it draws insights from increasingly diverse fields of research inquiry, from neuroscience and social science to computer science and adversity science; (2) that it provides a means to understand principles that generalize across learners, and yet also allow individual differences in learning to emerge and inform; and (3) that it recognizes that learning occurs in context, and is thus a shared responsibility between the learner, the instructor, and the environment. Here I discuss how this complex systems dynamical perspective can be integrated with the emerging framework of ‘learning engineering’ to provide a blueprint for significant innovations in education.",Uncapher M.,Journal,Applied Developmental Science,2019-10-02,University of California,

"Sustainable Development by Internet Backpack in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia and Costa Rica","Wireless grid research and innovation - what we now call cloud to edge or Internet of Things cyberphysical systems research - spearheaded by Syracuse University School of Information Studies (iSchool) with diverse partners and with support from the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Division of Engineering, and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) has led to the invention of an Internet Backpack which is capable of bringing connectivity anywhere, sustainably. The Internet Backpack is also a microgrid with a solar panel and battery included. This paper focuses on preliminary findings from ongoing Internet Backpack pilot deployments which were initiated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2017, in Liberia in 2018 and in Costa Rica in 2019. We find that by design, the Internet Backpack's cloud to edge cyberphysical platform is capable of flexible and affordable connectivity across more than 11 physical and software-defined/cyberphysical networks, for over 90% of the planet. Further, we find that Internet Backpacks as a service can significantly contribute to accelerating the availability of affordable Internet access for the 3.5 Billion people presently excluded from full participation in realizing their individual human development due to, among other things, lack of Internet access. The paper concludes that Internet Backpacks and other Community Network platforms will likely become more readily available for education, disaster preparedness and other humanitarian uses because of their paradigm-shifting potential for connectivity cost reductions and service enhancements for many people and regions around the world presently largely excluded from sustainable development.",McKnight L.; Smith D.; Salas-Castro A.; Belli L.,Conference Proceeding,"2019 IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference, GHTC 2019",2019-10-01,School of Information Studies;Fundacao Getulio Vargas;Syracuse University;Democracy Lab,Connectivity ;  Digital Inclusion ;  Humanitarian Technology ;  Internet Backpack ;  Sustainable Development
Understanding Differences in Student Learning Outcomes between the U.S. and Norwegian Educational Systems,"A Work in Progress pilot study. The National Academy of Engineers report on the Attributes of the Engineer of 2020 proposes substantial changes in engineering education that support greater intellectual diversity, improved complex thinking skills, better team skills, and engineers that, in general, are more innovative and adaptable to the changing complexities faced by today's industries. While considerable work has been done in research to practice towards developing these skills, there is limited data available on the advantages and/or disadvantages of differing educational systems. In this pilot study the researchers identified two cohort groups for initial study. These included a senior year student cohort in a U.S. program and a senior year cohort in Norway. The study asks a central question as to what extent the different programs help to promote or hinder development of the attributes of the Engineer of 2020. Assessments included measurements of student typology, critical thinking, self-efficacy, and creativity/ innovation. While curricular content is similar between the two programs, the pedagogical approach is substantially different. While outcome differences were relatively small due to small sample sizes and student variation, results in some areas encourage the authors to think about a broader, more comprehensive study that could help to provide more definitive differences the two types of pedagogical approaches.",Safari A.; Andersson G.; Kellogg S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2019-10-01,South Dakota School of Mines & Technology;University College of Østfold,international education ;  inversion ;  outcomes ;  problem solving skills
Variations in Engineering Design Projects Used in Secondary Education,"The inclusion of engineering elements in the Next Generation Science Standards and the importance of preparing students for future challenges promoted the integration of science and engineering concepts in K-12 education.

Furthermore, we investigate the most appropriate indicators to establish this measurement. To this end, we applied a questionnaire with ten questions, in order to verify the interviewees conceptual level about what is Design Thinking and what are the indicators. From the results, we sought to identify the perception of the interviewees about the use of indicators in Design Thinking, in a more profound way. The questionnaires were carried out in the e-survey format and the analyzes were carried out taking into account the interviewee level of education and the level of knowledge that he/she had in relation to Design Thinking and indicators. The results demonstrated the difficulty of defining specific indicators for projects that use Design Thinking since most of the interviewees did not demonstrate minimal conceptual knowledge regarding the methodology and the Design Thinking process, as well as the definition and application of indicators. However, it was possible to analyze a list of indicators as possible candidates for the application in projects that use Design Thinking, considering that few people have demonstrated to have the minimum conceptual knowledge on the subject and, therefore, this small group of people can not reflect the general context about what are the best indicators for measuring steps in the Design Thinking process.",Almeida F.; Canedo E.; Costa R.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2019-10-01,Universidade de Brasília,Design Thinking ;  Empirical Studies in Software Engineering ;  Indicators ;  Innovations ;  Metrics
Experiential Learning Spaces for Industrial Engineering Education,"This Research to Practice Full Paper presents an expanded conceptualization of Learning Spaces (LS) for Industrial Engineering education, by integrating Experiential Learning (EL) into relevant learning activities, in order to develop specific learning outcomes. This idea refers to Experiential Learning Spaces (ELS) that recreate intended practical activities in specific real-world contexts that contribute to students recognizing relevance in their studies. From a systemic perspective, LS might be approached in terms of the participation students, academics and other educational stakeholders actively sustain in learning experiences. This view goes beyond physical facilities, venues or virtual environments to shift attention to the domains of social interaction that support people's collective activities in a situation. This work also presents a framework to conceptualize learning experiences for active problem-solving and decision-making to support the educational practice of Industrial Engineering in ELS. An instance is presented in relation to the Social Lab for Sustainable Logistics (SLSL), in which multiple perspectives of stakeholders and situational complexity are considered to study Logistics and Supply Chain Management (LSCM) operations under sustainability constrains. This work main contribution resides in conceptualizing LS in terms of the incorporation of experiential learning into purposeful social domains of interaction as experiential learning systems.",Salinas-Navarro D.; Garay-Rondero C.; Calvo E.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2019-10-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Educational Innovation ;  Experiential Learning ;  Experiential Learning Spaces ;  Industrial Engineering ;  Learning Spaces
Exploring the Relationships between Engineering Internships and Innovation Interests and Likelihood of Accepting a Job Offer,"This research to practice full paper presents the work of an academic-industry research partnership to explore the internship experiences of summer interns at a large global engineering company. Engineering internships give students the opportunity to apply the engineering skills they have been learning to real products and can have high impact on innovation and engineering task self-efficacy. Innovation self-efficacy (ISE) and engineering task self-efficacy (ETSE) matter because these measures are an important predictor of major and career choice [1]. In contrast, innovation interests indicate an individual's interest in innovative behaviors and outcomes. This paper explores students' innovation interests, as related to their internship work assignment and supervisor interactions. Furthermore, the relationship between the internship experience and the intern's likelihood of accepting a job offer from the same company is also explored. A survey administered to product development interns (N=115) at the end of their summer 2017 internship at a large global engineering company forms the main dataset for this work.",Trego M.; Chen H.; Prasad K.; Sheppard S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2019-10-01,Stanford Engineering;Ford Motor Company,Engineering Education Research ;  Industrial Partnerships and Collaborations ;  Innovation and Creativity
Gamification as a Strategy to Improve Students' Motivation and Engagement in Educational Environments at Engineering Courses: Bibliographic,"This abstract is related to a work in progress and the category is research. The continuous search for methods to spur students' motivation and concentration at the diverse array of academic study fields has brought the need for innovations in the educational environment, in this context, it emerges the gamification concept. This work aims to identify the concept of gamification and its applicability specifically geared towards Engineering courses. To achieve this goal, a bibliographic review was carried out in two stages. The first one looked for studies that addressed the definition of techniques based on games in general, their relation with the teaching process and possibilities of use in educational environments, whether virtual or not. In a second moment, the work listed several job prospects of gamification directed specifically to the Engineering context. For this purpose, several repositories were mapped and 38 scientific papers were selected. Through the mapping of the literature it was possible to obtain a knowledge base on the subject and, from this, to trace the potentialities not yet fully explored in which one can glimpse a field for the continuity of the research.",Goncalves M.; Freitas A.; Goncalves E.; Barwaldt R.; MacHado R.; Otero T.; Oliveira M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2019-10-01,Universidade Federal do Rio Grande,Engineering ;  gamification ;  systematic review ;  undergratuate programs
Filling an engineering specialist void: FITech University Network - A cooperative education initiative to support the growth of Southwestern Finland,"Technology industry with sufficient ability and investment in research, development and innovation is the core of successful growth of several national economies. Higher education institutions need to provide a wide range of engineers with an increasing level of cross-disciplinary skills. An active, local presence of a university providing degree programs and research in technology has a strong link with the volume and development of the technology industry in the region. While modern technologies, especially information and communication technology (ICT), allow research and development activities to be independent of the location, other sectors of technology industry, such as maritime industry, require significant investments in physical facilities, bound to the region. Governments face two main challenges to maintain their industry's engineering competitiveness: (1) to prepare engineering graduates across expanding ranges of skills and knowledge, and (2) to provide the engineers in the regions where these skills are needed. Southwestern Finland is a region with the fastest growing technology industry in the country. Without a university with a full range of opportunities for academic engineering education in the region, there is an increasing number of job openings that cannot be filled. In Finland, students in engineering connect with the industry already during their studies and, after graduation, tend to stay in the region where they studied. To expose engineering students to the challenges of Southwestern Finland without creating new permanent higher education engineering structures in the region, the Finnish government in 2017 launched FITech, a 5-year project including all the seven Finnish universities offering engineering education. The purpose of FITech is to offer a nationwide cooperative solution to coordinate and provide engineering education and research in all domains of engineering to support the growth of Southwestern Finland region. This paper introduces the foundations and objectives of FITech and using the early indications of its results suggests a framework to evaluate the success of this complex nationwide project. Preliminary outcomes from the perspective of the University of Turku, one of the seven FITech partners, utilizing an adapted version of Hevner et al design science framework, show the challenges in achieving sufficient regional impact by the FITech approach and provide guidance for its ongoing development and implementation.",Vasankari T.; Sedano C.; Sutinen E.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2019-10-01,Turun yliopisto,engineering education ;  FITech ;  university network

Creating Common Instruments to Evaluate Education and Diversity Impacts across Three Engineering Research Centers,"This Innovative Practice Work in Progress paper presents the collaborative efforts made by three NSF-funded Engineering Research Centers (ERCs) to synthesize common tools for educational program evaluation. The aim of the NSF ERCs is to achieve transformative changes by integrating engineering research and education with technological innovation within areas at the frontiers of science and engineering (e.g., NSF's 10 Big Ideas). Such centers across the nation study and innovate within their technical area using similar structures and implementation strategies, including the coordination of educational endeavors. Independent partners are enlisted as part of these centers to evaluate education and diversity impacts annually. Each center typically performs this task in isolation from other such centers. The effort required to create resources for such evaluation outcome can result in redundancy and an inability for psychometric analysis due to small available populations within a single center. This paper elaborates on the ongoing efforts of this collaborative research aimed at addressing these issues by creating a streamlined, customizable, and standardized set of evaluation instruments that can be applied to any ERC evaluation.",Zhao Z.; Carberry A.; Barnard W.; Cook-Davis A.; Jordan M.; Larson J.; O'Donnell M.; Savenye W.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2019-10-01,Ira A.

Benefits of Teaching Systems Thinking as part of an Engineering Curriculum,"In this Research-to-Practice, Work in Progress paper, we examine the benefits of teaching systems thinking in an engineering curriculum. The call to include systems thinking and systems engineering courses as part of general engineering curriculum has received an increased amount of attention during the past few years. The need to improve the skills of all engineering students to help them deal with realistic, unbounded and complex problems, in a multidisciplinary environment that would produce viable and robust solutions, along with new ABET criteria has also helped this call. In this paper, we present supporting arguments to include one or more courses in systems thinking and engineering systems design as part of an engineering curriculum. This is done by identifying key common requirements between innovation and systems thinking. Including these courses will enhance professional skills and directly impact several 'student outcomes' requirement under ABET. We also argue that these courses will positively impact and enhance innovation and entrepreneurship abilities.",Azemi A.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2019-10-01,Pennsylvania State University,Engineering Design ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Innovation ;  Systems Thinking
Prioritizing Determinants of Internet of Things (IoT) Technology Adoption: Case Study of Agribusiness PT. XYZ,"At present, manufacturing industry has the challenge of being able to manage the production chain to be responsive and quickly. In doing so, industry has tried to meet this need by adopting the latest technology of Internet of Things (IoT). This study aims to prioritize the determinants that influence the decision to adopt the Internet of Things technology in one of the agribusiness industries in Indonesia, namely PT. XYZ. This research model was built by combining two theories of information technology adoption, namely technology-organization-environment (TOE) and human-organization-technology (HOT -fit). The research model consists of four main criteria, namely human, technological, organizational, and environmental criteria with 20 factors spread across each criterion. Data collection was done using a questionnaire given to 12 decision makers of PT. XYZ. The data was processed by using Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation and Laboratory (DEMATEL) technique. The conclusion obtained from this study is that human factor becomes the most important criteria when compared to other main criteria. According to human factor, the innovation attitude of the leaders and technical skills of IT staff are the most important factors when compared to other factors. From the technological perspective, the IS / IT infrastructure as well as data security and privacy factors are the most important factors when compared to other factors. On the other side, top management support and perceived technology adoption costs are the most important factors from the perspective of organizational criteria. Finally, the perceived mimetic pressure factor and perceived coercive pressure are the most important factors in environmental perspective.",Ladasi S.; Shihab M.; Hidayanto A.; Budi N.,Conference Proceeding,"ICICOS 2019 - 3rd International Conference on Informatics and Computational Sciences: Accelerating Informatics and Computational Research for Smarter Society in The Era of Industry 4.0, Proceedings",2019-10-01,Universitas Indonesia,DEMATEL ;  HOT-fit ;  information technology adoption ;  Internet of Things ;  TOE
Manifesto for enterprise agility,"Based on the research findings and gaps that exist in the literature surveyed by Hayretdin Bahşi et al., a layered framework can be defined to assist leaders faced with innovation and agility challenges at the dawn of Industry 4.0 [1]. This framework is derived from a cyber-focus on understanding and assessing the lateral and horizontal dependencies affecting cyber-physical domains. The DoD is fully integrated in cyberspace operations where inputs and outputs of information are critical to mission success. DoD program managers are tasked with a total systems life cycle approach to managing and governing operational capabilities. Rather than considering individual applications separately, program managers' applications consist of combinations of Business, Military, Enterprise, Cyber-physical Systems, and Cloud Computing domains. The layered dependency framework presented in this paper addresses the gap in services identified. From this framework, a set of values and principles are defined to govern and manage Enterprise Agility within the operations and sustainment phase of a mission capability life cycle. An example instance of Enterprise Agility is presented for Planning Cyberspace Operations (PlanCyberOps).",Raygan R.; Henry S.,Conference Proceeding,"ISSE 2019 - 5th IEEE International Symposium on Systems Engineering, Proceedings",2019-10-01,Defense Systems Management College,Agility ;  Cyberspace ;  Enterprise ;  Innovation ;  Operations ;  Plancyberops ;  Process ;  Sustainment ;  Systems engineering
Development and evaluation of a method to estimate the probabilities of occurrence of environment-and system scenarios based on the valuation of trends and a Cross-Impact-Analysis,"Studies show, that decisions made in the early phase of product development have a significant impact on the quality, cost, development time and success of the product on the market [10] [15]. Activities of foresight are suited to support product developers in their daily activities of product development. The basis for this is the model of PGE-Product Generation Engineering [2]. Product development processes described by the model of PGE always rely on a reference system and distinguish between adoption variation, shape variation and principle variation. The use of foresight in a systematic approach translates the findings of the derived future scenarios into short-term, medium-term and long-term recommendations for action [13]. This approach supports product developers to generate knowledge about future developments as well as to minimize risks by identifying innovation potential. Until now, the recommendations for action are mainly descriptive without any use of probabilities of occurrence of future events. An estimation of these probabilities of occurrence of scenarios could generate further knowledge about the future development and therefore assist product developers in decisions during the early stage of the product development process more effectively. In order to develop a suited method or adapt an existing method, in this paper a literature research is done in order to examine what methods exist so far to assess the probability of occurrence of future events and scenarios. Based on the results a new method is designed to assess probabilities of occurrence of scenarios. The method is validated through a survey. In a last section the contribution to the early stage of product development will be clarified.",Marthaler F.; Buchta W.; Albers A.; Bursac N.,Conference Proceeding,"ISSE 2019 - 5th IEEE International Symposium on Systems Engineering, Proceedings",2019-10-01,TRUMPF Group;Karlsruher Institut für Technologie,PGE-Product Generation Engineering ;  Probability of occurrence ;  Scenario

Preliminary Study of Optimization of Mri-compatible Ultrasonic Transducer Matching Layer Composites with Comsol,"Phase controlled high intensity focused ultrasound (p-hifu) is electronic phase controlled focusing.By adjusting the excitation voltage phase and amplitude of each array element, a variety of sound field modes, such as single-focus movement and multi-focus, can be generated. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can reflect tissue details in nondestructive conditions and measure the temperature of tissue in vivo by analyzing the proton resonance frequency signals. The combination of p-hifu technology and MRI technology improves the accuracy and safety of treatment, but the combination of the two brings about non-negligible electromagnetic interference problems. Most EMC problems can be solved by electromagnetic shielding. Based on previous studies, this paper intends to study a novel electromagnetic shielding material Cu-Epoxy for ultrasonic transducers.The biggest innovation of this material is its dual functions- electromagnetic shielding and ultrasonic matching layer.We conduct preliminary simulation with Comsol software to verify its feasibility. Through the simulation of electromagnetic field and piezoelectric effect, we find that this material is feasible in theoretical design. The biggest advantage of this simulation model is that it can be used for theoretical design of composite materials and explore the optimization of their performance. In further research, we can develop the model from the simplest two-dimensional axisymmetric model to a three-dimensional model, making it closer to the real situation.",Ren X.; Liu W.; Su Z.; Wu H.; Qiao S.; Lu H.; Shen G.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 12th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, BioMedical Engineering and Informatics, CISP-BMEI 2019",2019-10-01,"Shanghai Jiao Tong University;Shanghai Shende Medical Technology Co., Ltd",Comsol ;  Electromagnetic Shielding ;  Matching Layer ;  Simulation ;  Ultrasound Transducer
The greatest challenge for URN reduction in the oceans by means of engineering,"The Underwater Radiated Noise (URN) of the oceans due to shipping activity has increased during the last decades. This significant increment of URN can be explained by the remarkable growth of maritime traffic in recent years and the greater number of seismic explorations in the oceans. In relation to this issue, the current elevated level of underwater radiated noise in the oceans is producing a negative impact on marine fauna as it is happening with the Southern Resident Killer Whale (SRKW) in the Salish Sea in the west border between Canada and the USA. In the short-term, these high levels of URN block animal's ability to communicate, navigate, reproduce or hunt; while in the long-term, it may cause hearing loss in them. Hence, it is urgent to control the elevated level of URN in the oceans to protect the marine fauna and ensuring the sustainability of the sea environment. The majority of the underwater radiated noise produced by ships in the oceans originates from propellers, engines and auxiliary machinery. The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) Report No; 209 was created with the aim to establish certain limit values on the URN generated by ships. The main purpose of this analysis is to avoid the negative effects of the URN on the sea environment and protect to the marine fauna of the vessel echosounders interferences focusing on the design and build of silent ships by means of a noise and vibration comprehensive management methodology. The scientific community has demonstrated that the anthropogenic noise produced by the shipping sector is the main responsible for the relevant growth of the URN in the oceans which causes negative effects on marine life [2]. As a result, a benchmarking study has been addressed by Canada to inform about the negative impacts of URN in the marine environment and propose the creation of new regulatory policies on URN reduction. This exploratory study has been carried out by a specialized steering committee which is composed of a network of organizations with a proven record in RD and innovation activities in shipping URN. This technical study is in line with IMO conclusions for the reduction of URN from commercial shipping to address adverse impacts on marine life (MEPC.1/Circ.833; MEPC 74/17/2; MEPC 74/INF.36) representing the greatest challenge for the protection of the marine fauna in the oceans. To deal with the challenge of URN reduction in the oceans, the technological experiences accumulated over the years in the dynamic and acoustical design of modern Fishing Research Vessels (FRV) and Oceanographic Research Vessels (ORV) can be extrapolated to the rest of marine sectors. The main objective of this study is to identify which type of actions can be potentially used to manage and minimize URN generated by ships in the oceans without affecting the marine traffic and the transport of goods. The main idea is to design a new generation of 'Silent Ships' in compliance not only with the strictest Comfort Class Notation requirements but also with the most restrictive URN requirements such as ICES No 209. The overall URN level of a ship at certain operational speed is the combination of the noise spectral component generated by different URN sources such as the main engine and the propeller. Consequently, the reduction of the overall URN level will imply preventive actions for each one of the dominant URN sources. In summary, it can be concluded that a drastic reduction of the underwater radiated noise in the oceans is of vital importance to guarantee the sustainability of the sea environment and protect marine life. Thus, it is necessary to promote the design of a new generation of silent vessels using the most advanced engineering technology developed for the minimization of URN.",Fuentes A.; Suchy M.; Palomo P.,Conference Proceeding,"OCEANS 2019 MTS/IEEE Seattle, OCEANS 2019",2019-10-01,TSI (Técnicas y Servicios de Ingeniería S.L.),Engineering ;  Marine ;  Noise ;  Silent ;  Standards ;  Thresholds ;  URN ;  Vessels ;  Whales

HRIpreneur Thinking: Strategies Towards Faster Innovation and Commercialization of Academic HRI Research,"In recent years, there has been a rapid rise in new product innovations in robots, robotic devices, human-robot interfaces, and social robots across the globe. This has largely been due to several inter-disciplinary research development output from industries as well as a few robotics research institutions who have successfully embraced the convergence of braintech, robotics engineering, biomedical engineering, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and novel platform in human-machine interactions. However, the rate and scale of innovation in human-robot interaction (HRI) and their impact in creating social goods is still much slower compared to similar developments in other fields of research. We surmise that HRI innovation and commercialization of HRI products present unique challenges that are typically not encountered in other industries. Fragmented research, lack of supporting infrastructure and the gaps between lab research and user needs; as well as lack of venture capital investment in hardware products have led to sluggish innovation and longer duration of bringing those innovation into the real-world market. In this paper, we discuss the unique set of challenges faced by current HRI research/innovation and propose some methodology to direct the academic intellectual resources towards faster commercialization of their research.",Wang K.; Shidujaman M.; Zheng C.; Thakur P.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on Advanced Robotics and its Social Impacts, ARSO",2019-10-01,Swanson School of Engineering;Royal College of Art;Tsinghua University;EXGwear Inc.,

Measurement system for the analysis of social innovation in projects,"Recent studies regarding Social Innovation (SI) represent a small percentage of the academic research, and as a consequence the methodologies, focuses, and practices about this topic have not been consolidated. The social innovations generate intangible benefits, mainly qualitative, which makes it difficult to evaluate, even though few authors have indicated the distinguishable characteristics of SI there is not consensus about how to measure it. This document presents the results of a research project with the main objective of identifying the criteria distinguishing SI, and to propose a tool to facilitate its measurement, tracing, and potential assessment. A systematic criteria revision was performed along with a comparative study of eight SI projects from Latin America, prioritizing such criteria. With this information a proposal was developed, including the criteria, associated questions and ponderations. In order to validate the utility of this tool, the evaluation of the project 'Implementation of a Solar-Eolic hybrid system in a school in remoted and insolated areas' was performed. The evaluation process allowed to inquire and discover the weaknesses and to explore the limiting causes for every criterion, giving place for recommendations directed to the developers and beneficiaries of the project. Throughout this tool it can be determined whether a project can be considered a successful SI or not; in case of not being successful, the method exerts a simple view of the characteristics that need improvement.",Martez N.; Dieste E.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 7th International Engineering, Sciences and Technology Conference, IESTEC 2019",2019-10-01,Universidad Tecnológica de Panamá;Universidad Politécnica de Madrid,Evaluation criteria ;  Indicators ;  Measurement system ;  Social innovation

Revisiting the myth of disruptive innovation: An exploratory study of Chinese Learners' Perception of Massive Open Online Courses,"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are regarded as disruptive innovations for allowing open and free access to higher education resources for virtually unlimited populations. MOOCs have gained increasing prominence in China, especially since the government launched the nationwide initiative of building a lifelong learning society. In addition to the political support, innate advantages such as the enormous market potential for higher education and the mass of Internet users have been driving the rapid growth of MOOCs. However, the belief that MOOCs may be a disruptive innovation when opening up higher education seems to have abated. In order to lay the groundwork that guides the future MOOC initiatives, this qualitative study explored implications from the current situation of MOOCs in China via examining Chinese learner perceptions, given that learner perception is vital to reveal the effectiveness of MOOCs. From the perspective of Chinese learners, MOOCs merely interrupted their current epistemological value of learning and brought positive impacts to the landscape of the Chinese higher education system, rather than disrupting the current system. The research suggests embarking on several pertinent endeavors to maintain the effectiveness of MOOCs in China.",Tang H.; Wang S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 8th International Conference of Educational Innovation through Technology, EITT 2019",2019-10-01,University of South Carolina;The University of Southern Mississippi,Disruptive innovation ;  Effectiveness ;  Learner perception ;  Massive open online courses ;  Qualitative study

User acceptance of predictive analytics on violence against women and children at risk: A field survey in the Philippines,"Government agencies always need innovative technology solutions to cope with changes and manage critical processes, especially in creating policies and decision-making to benefit the vulnerable members of society. To address these needs, information technology solutions with analytics are introduced to government institutions. This study explores the user acceptance of information technology solution with analytics to aid in decision-making in the areas of children at risk, children in conflict with the law and violence against women. This study used the Technology Acceptance Model in assessing the users' acceptance through a survey conducted among professionals working in a social welfare and development agency in the Philippines. Results show that several variables have significant relationships. Perceived usefulness and perceived ease of used plays an essential role in users' intentions to use predictive analytics. Further, self-efficacy and facilitating condition positively influences perceived of usefulness and perceived ease of use, while technological complexity is not a significant factor to perceived usefulness. However, it positively influences the perceived ease of use. Overall, the respondents positively accept the predictive analytics on violence against women and children at risk. This work contributes by providing an understanding of user acceptance of innovation used in social welfare and development agency in the Philippines.

Intelligent neural network schemes for multi-class classification,"Multi-class classification is a very important technique in engineering applications, e.g., mechanical systems, mechanics and design innovations, applied materials in nanotechnologies, etc. A large amount of research is done for single-label classification where objects are associated with a single category. However, in many application domains, an object can belong to two or more categories, and multi-label classification is needed. Traditionally, statistical methods were used; recently, machine learning techniques, in particular neural networks, have been proposed to solve the multi-class classification problem. In this paper, we develop radial basis function (RBF)-based neural network schemes for single-label and multi-label classification, respectively. The number of hidden nodes and the parameters involved with the basis functions are determined automatically by applying an iterative self-constructing clustering algorithm to the given training dataset, and biases and weights are derived optimally by least squares. Dimensionality reduction techniques are adopted and integrated to help reduce the overfitting problem associated with the RBF networks. Experimental results from benchmark datasets are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.",You Y.; Wu C.; Lee S.; Liu C.,Journal,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),2019-10-01,Kaohsiung Medical University Chung-Ho Memorial Hospital;Kaohsiung Medical University;National Sun Yat-Sen University,Activation function ;  Clustering algorithm ;  Multi-class classification ;  Multi-label ;  Multi-label ;  Single-label
Next-generation AAV vectors-do not judge a virus (only) by its cover,"Recombinant adeno-Associated viruses (AAV) are under intensive investigation in numerous clinical trials after they have emerged as a highly promising vector for human gene therapy. Best exemplifying their power and potential is the authorization of three gene therapy products based on wild-Type AAV serotypes, comprising Glybera (AAV1), Luxturna (AAV2) and, most recently, Zolgensma (AAV9). Nonetheless, it has also become evident that the current AAV vector generation will require improvements in transduction potency, antibody evasion and cell/tissue specificity to allow the use of lower and safer vector doses. To this end, others and we devoted substantial previous research to the implementation and application of key technologies for engineering of next-generation viral capsids in a high-Throughput 'top-down' or (semi-)rational 'bottom-up' approach. Here, we describe a set of recent complementary strategies to enhance features of AAV vectors that act on the level of the recombinant cargo. As examples that illustrate the innovative and synergistic concepts that have been reported lately, we highlight (i) novel synthetic enhancers/promoters that provide an unprecedented degree of AAV tissue specificity, (ii) pioneering genetic circuit designs that harness biological (microRNAs) or physical (light) triggers as regulators of AAV gene expression and (iii) new insights into the role of AAV DNA structures on vector genome stability, integrity and functionality. Combined with ongoing capsid engineering and selection efforts, these and other state-of-The-Art innovations and investigations promise to accelerate the arrival of the next generation of AAV vectors and to solidify the unique role of this exciting virus in human gene therapy.",Domenger C.; Grimm D.,Journal,Human Molecular Genetics,2019-10-01,Deutsches Zentrum für Herz-Kreislauf-Forschung e.

The moderator of innovation culture and the mediator of realized absorptive capacity in enhancing organizations' absorptive capacity for SPI success,"Software process improvement (SPI) is critical to information system development. In the context of successful SPI, this research focuses on a firm's dynamic learning ability to see how it facilitates an effective means of acquiring and utilizing external SPI knowledge in responding to changing software development environments. Specifically, the authors propose a research model to investigate how two mechanisms of absorptive capacity are incorporated with innovation culture as a contextual factor to enable successful software process improvement. A survey was conducted including 125 SPI certified firms in China and Taiwan to examine the model. The findings indicate that a firm's potential absorptive capacity significantly influences realized absorptive capacity, which has a significant impact on SPI success and acts as a partial mediator between potential absorptive capacity and SPI success. Moreover, the results suggest that the mediating effect of potential absorptive capacity on SPI success via realized absorptive capacity is amplified when innovation culture is imposed.",Lee J.; Chen C.,Journal,Journal of Global Information Management,2019-10-01,National Central University;Beijing Normal University,Capability Maturity Model Integration ;  Dynamic Capability ;  Innovation Culture ;  Potential Absorptive Capacity ;  Realized Absorptive Capacity ;  Software Process Improvement (SPI)
Improving the Rate of Translation of Tissue Engineering Products,"Over 100 000 research articles and 9000 patents have been published on tissue engineering (TE) in the past 20 years. Yet, very few TE products have made their way to the market during the same period. Experts have proposed a variety of strategies to address the lack of translation of TE products. However, since these proposals are guided by qualitative insights, they are limited in scope and impact. Machine learning is utilized in the current study to analyze the entire body of patents that have been published over the past twenty years and understand patenting trends, topics, areas of application, and exemplifications. This analysis yields surprising and little-known insights about the differences in research priorities and perceptions of innovativeness of tissue engineers in academia and industry, as well as aids to chart true advances in the field during the past twenty years. It is hoped that this analysis and subsequent proposal to improve translational rates of TE products will spur much needed dialogue about this important pursuit.",Ghaemi R.; Siang L.; Yadav V.,Journal,Advanced Healthcare Materials,2019-10-01,The University of British Columbia,biopharmaceutical industry ;  innovation ;  machine learning ;  tissue engineering ;  translation
Controlling the risks of nano-enabled products through the life cycle: The case of nano copper oxide paint for wood protection and nano-pigments used in the automotive industry,"The widespread use of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) in consumer products and the overwhelming uncertainties in their ecological and human health risks have raised concerns regarding their safety among industries and regulators. There has been an ongoing debate over the past few decades on ways to overcome the challenges in assessing and mitigating nano-related risks, which has reached a phase of general consensus that nanotechnology innovation should be accompanied by the application of the precautionary principle and best practice risk management, even if the risk assessment uncertainties are large. We propose a quantitative methodology for selecting the optimal risk control strategy based on information about human health and ecological risks, efficacy of risk mitigation measures, cost and other contextual factors. The risk control (RC) methodology was developed in the European FP7 research project SUN and successfully demonstrated in two case studies involving real industrial nano-enabled products (NEPs): nano-scale copper oxide (CuO) and basic copper carbonate (Cu2(OH)2CO3) used as antimicrobial and antifungal coatings and impregnations for the preservation of treated wood, and two nanoscale pigments used for colouring plastic automotive parts (i.e. red organic pigment and carbon black). The application of RC for human health risks showed that although nano-related risks could easily be controlled in automotive plastics case study with modifications in production technology or specific type of engineering controls, nano-related risks due to sanding and sawing copper oxide painted wood were non-acceptable in the use lifecycle stage and would need the identification of a more effective risk control strategy.",Semenzin E.; Subramanian V.; Pizzol L.; Zabeo A.; Fransman W.; Oksel C.; Hristozov D.; Marcomini A.,Journal,Environment International,2019-10-01,Nederlandse Organisatie voor toegepast natuurwetenschappelijk onderzoek- TNO;Università Ca' Foscari Venezia;University of Leeds,Life cycle ;  Nano-copper oxide ;  Nano-pigments ;  Nanomaterials ;  Risk assessment ;  Risk management
University technology transfer efficiency in a factor driven economy: the need for a coherent policy in Egypt,"The article examines the effectiveness of instruments to promote technology transfer and foster entrepreneurial innovation in Egypt where there are individual measures but no comprehensive, unified policy or strategy to promote the transfer and commercialisation of the intellectual property stemming from university research. The study examines the extent of technology transfer in the country and the effectiveness of the various existing measures through a four-phase investigation involving in-depth interviews with experts, a questionnaire survey of 400 Egyptian Science, Engineering and Technology academics, three case studies of Technology Transfer Offices and a 237 respondent industry survey. The results indicate that despite the measures that have been introduced, there is little university–industry collaboration and that the interventions are of limited effectiveness. The article concludes that there is a need for a broad, national co-ordinating policy that encourages universities and industry to collaborate, particularly on research, and to engage in the transference and commercialisation of technology.",Kirby D.; El Hadidi H.,Journal,Journal of Technology Transfer,2019-10-01,The British University in Egypt,Efficiency ;  Egypt ;  Factor-driven economy ;  National policy ;  Technology transfer
"The digital transformation of innovation and entrepreneurship: Progress, challenges and key themes","The emergence of novel and powerful digital technologies, digital platforms and digital infrastructures has transformed innovation and entrepreneurship in significant ways. Beyond simply opening new opportunities for innovators and entrepreneurs, digital technologies have broader implications for value creation and value capture. Research aimed at understanding the digital transformation of the economy needs to incorporate multiple and cross-levels of analysis, embrace ideas and concepts from multiple fields/disciplines, and explicitly acknowledge the role of digital technologies in transforming organizations and social relationships. To help realize this research agenda, we identify three key themes related to digitization—openness, affordances, and generativity—and, outline broad research issues relating to each. We suggest that such themes that are innate to digital technologies could serve as a common conceptual platform that allows for connections between issues at different levels as well as the integration of ideas from different disciplines/areas. We then summarize the contributions of the 11 papers presented in this Special Issue relating them to one or more of these themes and outlining their implications for future research.",Nambisan S.; Wright M.; Feldman M.,Journal,Research Policy,2019-10-01,The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill;Imperial College London;Case Western Reserve University,Affordance ;  Digital innovation ;  Digital platforms ;  Digital transformation ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Generativity ;  Innovation ;  Openness
Interpreting Integrated STEM: Sustaining Pedagogical Innovation Within a Public Middle School Context,"Integrated STEM education leverages interconnections between science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in order to reflect upon how each discipline operates within real world contexts. Students benefit from the integrated STEM approach because it values the real-life experiences of students along with the hands-on applications that mirror professional STEM work. Nevertheless, integrated STEM instruction remains ill-defined with many gaps evident in the existing research of how implementation explicitly works. The school setting central to this case study was a suburban public middle school that had sustained an integrated STEM program for a period of over 5 years. Through the use of phenomenological qualitative inquiry, we focused on both teachers’ and students’ experiences of participation in one integrated STEM model. Three major themes emerged as part of this inquiry. First, teachers engaged in continual reflection that along with district supports contributed to the durability of the model. Second, teachers and student engaged in dynamic learning transactions based on the particular task and concept covered. Third, science projects anchored learning opportunities deemed most successful by participants.",Gardner M.; Tillotson J.,Journal,International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education,2019-10-01,Syracuse University;Colgate University,Co-teaching ;  Interdisciplinary instruction ;  Secondary education ;  STEM education
Scientific and technological (human) social capital formation and Industry–University Cooperative Research Centers: a quasi-experimental evaluation of graduate student outcomes,"In the current paper, we attempt to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of science, technology and innovation (STI) outputs and outcomes through the application of a Scientific and Technical Human Capital (STHC) evaluation framework. We do this by describing a study that focuses on a type of STI initiative that appears ripe with potential to affect STHC impacts—Industry–University Cooperative Research Centers (IUCRCs). In doing so we summarize relevant theory related to the STHC framework and social capital formation more generally. We also define IUCRCs and highlight the program mechanisms that appear likely to impact the STHC outcomes. Finally, we narrow our focus to a relatively neglected research target of the STI evaluation—science and engineering (S&E) doctoral students. We compare social capital and other students’ outcomes by employing a rare quasi-experimental design with two training modalities: IUCRC and more traditional, non-center training. We show that our results demonstrate strong evidence for positive effects of IUCRC training on graduate S&E students’ outcomes. We also explain significant moderating effect of citizenship status on some of our results where international students, who account for 50% of this population, do not receive the same social capital outcomes as students with US citizenship or permanent resident status. In addition, we describe patterns in international students’ intentions to stay in the US and how they are affected by students’ training modality. Finally, we discuss the results and implications in the context of graduate training, STHC evaluation framework and STI and immigration policy.",Leonchuk O.; Gray D.,Journal,Journal of Technology Transfer,2019-10-01,NC State University,Cooperative research centers ;  Industry–university cooperation ;  Science technology and innovation ;  Social capital ;  Students
Development of a Smart Bioink for Bioprinting Applications,"Biofabrication is an incipient and fast-growing field of research that continues to develop groundbreaking innovations. Considerable progress has also been made in additive manufacturing technologies, which are used for the production of complex geometry using biomaterials, such as scaffolds and, most recently, bioink-based structures. Some of the topics related to these new breakthroughs in tissue engineering and bioprinting will be discussed. Additionally, the obtained experimental results in this work contribute to the recent advances in such sciences. Formulations of sodium alginate (NaAlg)/Poly(N-Isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm)/ZnSO4-based smart bioinks were developed and characterized. The lower critical solution temperature (LCST), viscosity, and thermal stability were determined through UV-Visible spectroscopy, a rheological analysis and a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), respectively. Furthermore, an injectability test was performed in order to assess the influence of the extrusion process in the morphology of the bioinks like scaffolds (after lyophilization) using scanning electron microscopy SEM. According to the obtained results, the scaffolds presented a structure composed of interconnected pore systems, which were affected by the presence of the Zn2+ ion, and the extrusion process. The biocompatibility of the gels was tested through a hemolysis assay using erythrocytes and the obtained results indicate that have not cytotoxic effects. For all these reasons these formulations are candidates for the obtention of intelligent bioinks applicable for bioprinting and tissue engineering.",Montero F.; Rezende R.; da Silva J.; Sabino M.,Journal,Frontiers in Mechanical Engineering,2019-09-27,3D Technologies Research Group (NT3D),alginate ;  bioprinting ;  extrusion ;  gels ;  PNIPAm ;  scaffolds ;  smart bioinks ;  tissue engineering

Patterning and process parameter effects in 3D suspension near-field electrospinning of nanoarrays,"The extracellular matrix (ECM) contains nanofibrous proteins and proteoglycans. Nanofabrication methods have received growing interest in recent years as a means of recapitulating these elements within the ECM. Near-field electrospinning (NFES) is a versatile fibre deposition method, capable of layer-by-layer nano-fabrication. The maximum layer height is generally limited in layer-by-layer NFES as a consequence of electrostatic effects of the polymer at the surface, due to residual charge and polymer dielectric properties. This restricts the total volume achievable by layer-by-layer techniques. Surpassing this restriction presents a complex challenge, leading to research innovations aimed at increasing patterning precision, and achieving a translation from 2D to 3D additive nanofabrication. Here we investigated a means of achieving this translation through the use of 3D electrode substrates. This was addressed by in-house developed technology in which selective laser melt manufactured standing pillar electrodes were combined with a direct suspension near-field electrospinning (SNFES) technique, which implements an automated platform to manoeuvre the pillar electrodes around the emitter in order to suspend fibres in the free space between the electrode support structures. In this study SNFES was used in multiple operation modes, investigating the effects of varying process parameters, as well as pattern variations on the suspended nanoarrays. Image analysis of the nanoarrays allowed for the assessment of fibre directionality, isotropy, and diameter; identifying optimal settings to generate fibres for tissue engineering applications.",Nagle A.; Fay C.; Wallace G.; Xie Z.; Wang X.; Higgins M.,Journal,Nanotechnology,2019-09-23,Deakin University;University of Wollongong,3D nanofabrication ;  nanofibers ;  near-field electrospinning ;  suspension near-field electrospinning
Corporate social network and enterprise R and D innovation,"Corporate social networks facilitate the dissemination and sharing of information and resources between enterprises, and information and resources are important factors in the company's innovative behavior. Therefore, this paper attempts to explore the impact of corporate social networks on the innovation behavior of listed companies in China from the perspective of corporate social networks. Further, by dividing the corporate social network composed of directors, supervisors and senior executives, this paper explores the emphasis of information of different members of listed companies on innovation activities.The empirical results show that with the increase of the network of all directors, supervisors and senior executives, the investment in innovation of listed companies will increase. By dividing the network of different members of the company, this study finds that different members have different focuses on different aspects of innovation behavior: The increase in the social network of directors and executives will significantly boost the R&D intensity of listed companies; The social network of independent directors and supervisors has no significant impact on the company's innovative behavior.The research in this paper not only proves that the social network of an enterprise will change the innovation behavior of an enterprise, but also, for the first time, through the division of the social network of an enterprise, empirically proves that different members of the company have different emphasis on their innovation activities. With the expansion of directors,supervisors and senior managers' social networks, listed companies will reduce innovation investment and innovative activities will be more conservative in uncertain environments,the social network of executives will significantly inhibit the risk preference of listed companies, while the social networks composed of other members have no significant impact on innovation risk preference.",Liu Z.; Pan Z.,Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2019-09-20,Yunnan University of Finance and Economics,Corporate social network ;  Enterprise innovation ;  Executive management
The relationship between network capabilities and innovation performance: Evidence from Chinese high-tech industry,"Purpose: Innovation networks provide an efficient mechanism for organizations to realize their potential for knowledge learning and innovation improvement. Firms situated within innovation networks require specific abilities to acquire the knowledge and the complementary assets that facilitate their innovation performance. Motivated by recent research studies in the area of social network and RBV, the purpose of this paper is to improve the understanding of the precise manner in which network capability affects a firm’s innovation performance. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the data obtained from Chinese high-tech firms, the hypotheses are tested by using hierarchical multiple regressions. Findings: This study identifies two types of network capabilities: network structural capability and network relational capability. The findings suggest that network structural capability has a greater positive impact on innovation performance than network relational capability does within an exploration-orientated network. However, network relational capability is more positively associated with innovation performance within an exploitation-orientated network. Practical implications: A firm can enhance the value of its ego network by shaping and adjusting network configurations, rather than by passively reaping the benefits from existing relationships or ties with partners. Originality/value: This paper contributes to strategic management theory and social network theory by illustrating how a networked firm can enable network value and appropriate this value according to its strategic purposes and by suggesting that a firm can improve its ego network’s value through exerting its network capabilities to shape and adjust network configurations. This paper also advances the contingent approach within social network research by offering a new complementary perspective and new evidence from a Chinese context.",Fang G.; Zhou Q.; Wu J.; Qi X.,Journal,Industrial Management and Data Systems,2019-09-19,Wolfson College Cambridge;Hangzhou Dianzi University,Innovation ;  Innovation ;  Network capabilities ;  Resource-based view
Reengineering engineering education at the University of los Andes: The REDINGE2 pilot project,"Purpose: The REDINGE2 – Reengineering Engineering Teaching, version 2 – project seeks to transform engineering education practices at the University of los Andes (UNIANDES) by using technology-based active learning strategies in courses from different disciplines that are to be reformed using a Big-ideas approach. Studies from this two-year project (2017-2018) seek to solve three main questions: What changes in engineering teaching conceptions, methods, tools and practices could be generated by reengineering courses using a Big-ideas approach? What changes in key conditions of learning environments have the students perceived in courses that use a Big-ideas approach? What lessons can be derived from the initial studies of REDINGE2’s pilot experiences? Design/methodology/approach: The REDINGE2 project was conceived as a technology-based educational transformation initiative. It is the Faculty of Engineering at UNIANDES’ explicit intention to move engineering teaching from being content-focused to being big-ideas focused. It also wants to migrate from teacher-centered teaching strategies to student- and group-centered approaches. Additionally, this project intends to enrich engineering education ecologies with digital resources by integrating experiential, flexible and collaborative digital learning environments with traditional classroom/workshop/library/home/work learning settings. To promote this organic change, the project implemented a facilitation-from-the side strategy, which redesigned 14 engineering courses: each was given a two-year grant from the Office of the Dean of Engineering to rethink teaching practices and redesign the course. A cybernetic evaluation system was embedded in the life cycle of the transformation process that could support decision-making through each of the project’s stages (Stufflebeam, 1971). Questions of interest in this study are provided with information using triangulation of data at different times during each course’s redesign process. Findings: After a year and half of the two-year REDINGE2 project (2017-2018), it is possible to say the following three research questions are fully solved. Concerning Question #1: What changes in engineering teaching conceptions, methods, tools and practices contribute to reengineering courses when using a Big-ideas approach? Participating teaching staff have demonstrated changes in their teaching conceptions, methods and resources, which can be attributed to their exposure to active-learning strategies supported by digital technologies. In fact, each one has redesigned and pilot tested at least one restructured learning unit for one of their courses according to the proposed Big-ideas approach; in addition, most admit to already having adjusted their teaching practices by changing their mindset regarding learning and how to promote it. Concerning Question #2: What changes in key conditions of learning environments have the students perceived in courses that have been redesigned using a Big-ideas approach? Data collected from students and participating staff members, both before the redesign and throughout this process, have provided teachers and students with feedback concerning perceived changes in learning environments. This has had positive results and provided opportunities for improvement. Concerning Question #3: What lessons can be derived from REDINGE2’s pilot experiences? Lessons from this project are multi-dimensional and there are organizational, pedagogic, technological and cultural considerations. A decalogue of critical success factors was established, which considered the things that must go right to successfully accomplish proposed educational transformations. Research limitations/implications: This study is a good case of educational transformations in engineering teaching. No generalizations should be made, but it shows that similar processes of planned change can be made in tertiary science, math, engineering and technology (SMET) education. Practical implications: The lessons learned from this experience are very valuable for higher education decision-makers who want to innovate by using learning ecologies in their institutions. In addition, theoretical considerations that illuminate the innovation process become very useful to help provide a foundation to similar interventions. Originality/value: A non-conventional approach to integrate digital technologies in higher education teaching is the most significant contribution this experience has made. Its focus has been to transform educational practices with pedagogically sound uses of digital technologies instead of just integrating technologies in current SMET teaching practices. Facilitation-from-the-side and embedded cybernetic evaluation through the transformation process are key ideas that add value to organic change processes.",Galvis Á.; Avalo A.; Ramírez A.; Cortés D.; Cantor H.,Journal,Kybernetes,2019-09-19,"Universidad de Los Andes, Colombia",Active learning strategies ;  Course redesign with facilitation-from-the-side ;  Course-redesign ;  Cybernetic program evaluation ;  Cybernetic project evaluation ;  Digital technologies for education ;  Educational transformations ;  Engineering education ;  Group-centered teaching ;  Idea-based course redesign ;  Student-centered teaching ;  Technology-based educational innovations ;  Technology-based educational transformations
The experimenting university,"Purpose: What has been called “the McDonaldization of universities” (another name for top-down and strong corporate managerialism) has gained momentum as a model for governing and managing universities. This trend exacerbates the traditional tension between academic freedom and managerial control – a major challenge for the administration of academic institutions. The ideas of Charles Darwin represent an opportunity for overcoming such a challenge. However, traditional managerial models show inadequate, pre-Darwinian assumptions for devising organizational designs. This paper aims to show not only the opportunities but also the challenges of embracing a Darwinian paradigm for designing social systems. The case of managerialism in universities is an illustrative example. The paper proposes evolutionary guidelines for designing universities capable of maintaining managerial control while warranting academic freedom. Design/methodology/approach: The paper proposes to understand the tension between academic freedom and managerial control in universities as the same tension between freedom and control that Karl Popper identified as successfully handled by evolutionary processes. The paper uses Darwinian theory, understood as a broader theory for complex systems, as a heuristic for designing social systems – universities in this case – able to adapt to changing environmental conditions while handling equilibrium between freedom and control. The methodology articulates the Popperian model of knowledge with the Darwinian scheme proposed by David Ellerman known as “parallel experimentation” for suggesting organizational forms in which university administrators and faculty can interact for generating free innovations in pseudo-controlled organizational arrangements. Findings: A salient characteristic of strong managerialism is its pre-Darwinian understanding of survival and adaptation; such an approach shows important flaws that can lead universities to unfit designs that changing environments can select for elimination. As an alternative, the philosophy behind the ideas of Charles Darwin provides guidelines for designing innovative and adaptive social systems. Evolutionary principles challenge basic tenets of strong managerialism as Darwinian designs discard the possibility of seeing managers as knowledgeable designers that allegedly can avoid mistakes by allocating resources to “one-best” solutions through ex ante exhaustive, top-down control. Instead, a Darwinian model requires considering survival as a matter of adaptability through continuous experimentation of blind trials controlled by ex post selection. The key is to organize universities as experimenting systems that try new and different things all the time and that learn and improve by making mistakes, as an adaptive system. Research limitations/implications: Governing and managing universities require to acknowledge the uniqueness of academic institutions and demand to look for appropriate forms of organization. The proposal of this paper opens possibilities for exploring and implementing action-research initiatives and practical solutions for universities. Studies in management and administration of higher-education institutions must take into account the characteristics of this type of organizations and should consider wider spectrums of possibilities beyond the core ideas of managerialism. Practical implications: University managers face a special challenge for achieving equilibrium between managerial control and academic freedom. Darwinian models of management invite to reconsider several management creeds, for instance, that “errors are bad things” – instead of innovation triggers and learning opportunities or that “one solution must fit all” – instead of considering bottom-up, different and adaptive solutions triggered by local academic units, each facing different environments.

Experiential Learning for Seismic Protection Using Living Lab Approach in Romania,"The purpose of the research: The paper is going to present the role of seismic areas as living labs/natural laboratories for studying the behavior of buildings and of people and establishing a relationship between a research, a training-education and a knowledge dissemination. The results materialized by experiential actions to reduce negative impacts of disasters are highlighted. Methodology: Engineering learning from earthquakes, based on a long-term seismic culture, became a continuous activity based on field observation, since more than a century. On the other hand, creating earthquake disaster prevention awareness and disaster preparedness can be achieved nowadays by education and active learning addressed to all levels of population, from elder generations to the younger ones, and from usual people to the representatives of authorities. The link between these two approaches is becoming more and more necessary in the context of high local seismicity: investigating the behavior of people, while using emerging technologies (computer-generated imagery, immersive virtual reality etc.), to obtain an active individual attitude. The general concept of awareness and preparedness trends evolved. To deal with earthquake-related situations, people are taught to take measures to prevent severe earthquakes effects, but we must take a step forward to get closer to the system that includes: research knowledge, innovation, GIS and specialized software, and more importantly, the access to all of these, through public and private involvement. Conclusions: The Vrancea seismic zone of Romania, as a natural laboratory, involves us with knowledge and individual perception and attitudes and we have time for improved engineering codes, exploring and experiencing some new learning modalities, refining new policies and regulations from this field, new scenarios for implementation of disaster measures.",Dobre D.; Sorin Dragomir C.; Georgescu E.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2019-09-18,NIRD URBAN-INCERC;Universitatea de Stiinte Agronomice si Medicina Veterinara din Bucuresti;Universitatea Tehnica de Constructii Bucuresti,

New Technologies for Airframe Structural Assemblies,"With air traffic demand constantly increasing and several years of aircraft production in their backlog, major aircraft manufacturers are now shifting their focus toward improving assembly process efficiency. One of the most promising solutions, known as ""One Side Assembly"", aims to perform the whole assembly sequence from one side of the structure (drilling, temporary fastener installation and removal, blind fastener installation, assembly control) and with a high level of integrated automation. Investments in robotic equipment, automation engineering and innovation are very active and automation capabilities have already increased a lot in the aerospace industry. As an example, drilling operations for large dimensions airframe are clearly moving from manual to automated. However, despite more and more clever and sophisticated robotics, the use of historical fasteners with two side installation method remains a strong limitation to innovative automated assembly sequences. A blind fastener which can provide the same mechanical characteristics than current structural fasteners, while providing automation friendly features and meeting cost objectives is a real ""must have"" for assembly process efficiency improvements. It is also full of challenges for aerospace fasteners industry. Many research and development activities are on-going to remove fasteners from the equation of aerospace structure assemblies, but we will consider in this article that fasteners will remain a good solution for many years from now, which is shared by a lot of professionals and which doesn't mean that nothing will change.",Dahane M.,Journal,SAE Technical Papers,2019-09-16,LISI Aerospace,

A Hierarchical Nanoporous Diamondoid Superstructure,"Sophisticated architectures assembled from a single class of subunits by cooperative interactions are ubiquitous in nature. The construction of their artificial mimics, however, remains one of the most formidable challenges facing synthetic chemists. Here, we report a hierarchical diamondoid superstructure—namely, a supramolecular diamond—that is constructed from the multiple-level self-assembly of a highly symmetrical salt, hexakis[(4,4′-bipyridin-1-ium)methylene]benzene hexafluorophosphate. The uniform octahedral single crystals, with 96 cationic organic fragments and 96 counteranions in a unit cell, can be prepared quantitatively in a controllable one-step procedure within seconds at ambient conditions. The sizes of the resulting samples are modulated from 280 nm to 660 μm. The mechanism of the self-assembly was elucidated at the atomic level. As proof of its intrinsically cationic superstructure with mobile anions, the three-dimensional nanoporous framework can exchange efficiently with metal oxoanions. This research shows that precisely tunable hierarchical assemblies can translate charged molecules into complicated architectures. Hierarchical self-assembly is a ubiquitous process for building sophisticated supramolecular architectures in nature. Mimicking the process and unraveling the mechanisms involved in high-precision self-assembly, however, remain a formidable challenge. Here, we present a unique strategy for constructing a hierarchical diamondoid superstructure—namely, a supramolecular diamond—that is constructed quantitatively from preorganized building blocks. The complementary interactions direct the repulsive cationic fragments to organize into a highly ordered 3D supramolecular framework. The sizes of the supramolecular diamond can be modulated from 280 nm to 660 μm. As proof of concept, the intrinsically cationic superstructure can exchange metal oxoanions with excellent efficiencies. This research shows the art and charm of hierarchical assembly and is a significant step toward a better fundamental understanding of how to produce precisely tunable assemblies. Stoddart and colleagues present a unique concept for constructing a nanoporous diamondoid superstructure—namely, a supramolecular diamond—from the hierarchical self-assembly of preorganized hexa-charged molecules. The octahedral single crystals of supramolecular diamond with controllable sizes can be prepared quantitatively within seconds under ambient conditions. This principle heralds a strategy for engineering complex supramolecular architectures from multi-charged ionic molecules, which are repulsive toward each other.",Guo Q.; Liu Z.; Li P.; Shen D.; Xu Y.; Ryder M.; Chen H.; Stern C.; Malliakas C.; Zhang X.; Zhang L.; Qiu Y.; Shi Y.; Snurr R.; Philp D.; Farha O.; Stoddart J.,Journal,Chem,2019-09-12,Robert R.

New product development-processes in the fashion industry: Evidence from Indonesian Islamic fashion companies,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is, first, to examine the design requirements of Islamic fashion in the new product-development process; second, to explore the different practices of new product-development activities from successful and unsuccessful new product lines; and third, to investigate the sequence of the new product-development practice in the fashion industry, specifically the Islamic fashion industry in Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach: Questionnaires were distributed and semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect information regarding the practice of the new product-development activities. The Mann–Whitney U test was performed based on the quality of the new product-development activities of 100 Islamic fashion firms, including five innovative companies that had won several awards in Indonesia. An analysis of the extent to which fashion firms were engaging in new product-development activities provided a more detailed picture of the sequence of those activities. Findings: Islamic norms were adapted during the early design and promotional phases of new product development in Islamic fashion. Various choices of design and colour in Islamic fashion were also perceived as a way of preaching to women to dress more accordingly to the Islamic norm. The new product-development activities that were conducted differently for successful vs unsuccessful new product lines were idea conceptualisation, market analysis, technical and engineering analysis, financial analysis and commercialisation. The commercialisation phase was given the least priority of all the activities. Nevertheless, it contributed to the very first communication to the customers about new product lines. Originality/value: This study makes an important contribution to the deeper and more detailed research on how Islamic fashion companies perceive Islamic values during new product developments and how they perform new product-development activities between successful and unsuccessful products.",Sari R.; Asad N.,Journal,Journal of Islamic Marketing,2019-09-10,Universitas Padjadjaran,Clothing ;  Design ;  Indonesia ;  Innovation ;  Islamic fashion ;  New product development

"Relationship Analysis between Company Standard, SNI, and International Standard in Washing Machine: A Case Study at an Electronic Company","PT XYZ is an electronic company that produces some electronic goods, one of which is a washing machine. In 2014, the product has been certified and labeled SNI on its products. SNI is a national standard established by the Indonesian government as a reference in producing or marketing goods in Indonesia. This is done as a protection measure for consumers. In addition, SNI is used as a standard for producers to penetrate international markets. However, the SNI does not specify the overall components of the goods. In the SNI document, there is no provision on the material that must be used, the size that must be imposed, so the company can develop the design, material and size of the product in detail. Development of standards outside the SNI conducted by the company herein after referred to the company standard. Company standards can be derived from innovations and product experiments conducted by the company or can also come from other standards adopted by the company, as an example is international standards on washing machine products. Thus there are several standards used in one washing machine product. For that in this research will find the relation between standard used in one product of washing machine by using case study analysis approach.",Bakhtiar A.; Widharto Y.; Rinawati D.; Nurfajrianti M.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2019-09-09,Universitas Diponegoro,

Miles and Snow’s strategic typology redux through the lens of ambidexterity,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to link firms’ strategic archetypes as formulated by Miles and Snow (1978) to the more recent literature on organizational ambidexterity. Examining these obvious linkages, the paper also addresses how these firms address their entrepreneurial, engineering and administrative problem domains in relationship with the firm’s strategic archetype. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 503 firms across the US. Measures previously validated were used to collect information related to the strategic archetype as well as the three problem domains. Multiple discriminant and regression analyses were used to test the hypotheses. Findings: Most of the hypotheses relating the entrepreneurial (exploration and exploitation), engineering (radical and incremental innovation) and administrative problem (adaptation and alignment) to the four strategic archetypes (defender, prospector, analyzer and reactor) were supported. Additionally, the authors found that the firms that had the closest alignment along the three problem domains outperformed the other firms. Originality/value: Although the Miles and Snow typology has received considerable research attention, the obvious links with more contemporary research on organizational ambidexterity has been neglected. Through this integration, with more recent key strategic management concepts, this paper shows the utility and current relevance of the Miles and Snow archetypes.",Sollosy M.; Guidice R.; Parboteeah K.,Journal,International Journal of Organizational Analysis,2019-09-09,Cameron School of Business;University of Wisconsin-Whitewater;Marshall University,Ambidexterity ;  Corporate strategy ;  Organizational ambidexterity ;  Strategic management
Sensitivity analysis of stormpav composite pavement,"This study investigates the design and performance of modified composite pavement called StormPav. In this study, the sensitivity analysis is carried out by using available freeware to prove whether the StormPav composite pavement is able to provide long-life pavement and better levels of performance, both structural and functionally, than the traditional pavements. For this case, the sensitivity analysis is included data for fatigue behavior, rutting in the HMA (Hot Mix Asphalt) layer, and temperature gradient reduction of PCC slab with an HMA overlay. The StormPav composite pavement is actually an innovation IBS green pavement with structural, environmental and economic advantages. Inspired from Legos concept, the StormPav is made out of modular panels or ""roadblocks"" that are like enormous lego pieces that assemble and interlocking together forming a uniform settlement and at the same time acting as the monolithic character. The idea of StormPav is actually to minimize the usage of material in the composite pavement but provide the same strength and benefits as composite pavement.",Putri E.; Rewani F.; Mannan M.; Ibrahim W.; Kabit M.; Tirau L.; Chan R.; Buking R.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2019-09-06,Universitas Andalas;Universiti Malaysia Sarawak,
A multi-game model of cooperative enterprise innovation strategy based on incomplete information,"Aiming at the influence of several factors including investment cost distribution, profit distribution, and sales volume of innovative products, the cooperation strategy is discussed in this paper. A tripartite game model of government, high-tech enterprise, and manufacturing enterprise was constructed. Based on the theory of two innovation stages-technological innovation and achievement transformation-the probability of government participation in innovation is directly proportional to the growth rate of the diffusion of innovative products. Research has shown that when technology transfer costs are within a certain range, the probability of two-phase cooperation is directly related to the amount of investment and the allocation ratio of income. When the cost of purchasing innovative technology exceeds the budget of manufacturing enterprises, the enterprise can only choose cooperative innovation or non-innovation. From this, we could see that the conclusion provided a certain theoretical basis for the cooperative innovation strategy of enterprises under the condition of asymmetric information.",Ma Y.; Li Y.,Journal,Harbin Gongcheng Daxue Xuebao/Journal of Harbin Engineering University,2019-09-05,Harbin Normal University;Harbin Engineering University,Achievement transformation ;  Cooperative innovation ;  Equilibrium ;  Game ;  Incomplete information ;  Innovation diffusion ;  Technology innovation ;  Technology transfer

Adoption of building information modeling in Chinese construction industry: The technology-organization-environment framework,"Purpose: Building information modeling (BIM) is recognized as a major innovation in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. Understanding the factors that influence the AEC’s adoption of BIM will benefit the research and practice of BIM. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: This study provides empirical evidence for the accumulated knowledge of BIM adoption by examining the context of Chinese construction industry. Based on the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework in the innovation diffusion literature, the authors develop a research model that integrates the critical success factors related to the technology of BIM, the construction company and the environment in Chinese construction industry. The authors collected two different data sets from engineering consulting firms and construction firms in China, and conducted rigorous analyses using a sophisticated statistical approach. Findings: The authors found that the relative advantage of BIM was a major factor that enabled BIM adoption, while the complexity of BIM was an inhibiter. In addition, management support was also a significant antecedent of BIM adoption. However, organizational readiness was significant for engineering consulting firms but not for construction firms. Surprisingly, the authors did not find consistent significant impacts of any environmental factors. Last, younger firms were more likely to adopt BIM. Originality/value: One of the first to apply the TOE framework to integrate three groups of factors that may explain BIM adoption in China. Such a comprehensive framework provides a much broader perspective of BIM adoption to evaluate the impacts of different antecedent factors. The authors conducted an empirical study based on survey data collected from two different types of companies, i.e., engineering consulting firms and construction firms, representing the two parties in the principal-agent relationship of a construction project.

Making Design Thinking Work: Adapting an Innovation Approach to Fit a Large Technology-Driven Firm,"Overview: In their quest to become more innovative, many firms try out new innovation approaches that are brought in from the outside. Design thinking has been one of these sought-after innovation approaches in recent years. Design thinking has produced remarkable results in creative firms such as design consultancies, but its implementation in large, established firms has proven to be far more challenging, especially if a strong company culture contradicts the philosophies underlying design thinking. One possible answer to this challenge lies in adapting an innovation approach such as design thinking to its new environment so it can truly take hold. We describe how a large, technology-driven firm proceeded in morphing the design thinking approach to allow it to take root in different parts of the company and over time become an integral part of the firm’s innovation activity.",Mahmoud-Jouini S.; Fixson S.; Boulet D.,Journal,Research Technology Management,2019-09-03,Haute Ecole Bruxelles-Brabant (HE2B);Babson College;Université Paris-Dauphine,Adaptation ;  Culture ;  Design thinking
Abductive innovations in information security policy development: an ethnographic study,"Developing organisational information security (InfoSec) policies that account for international best practices but are contextual is as much an opportunity for improving InfoSec as it is a challenge. Previous research indicates that organisations should create InfoSec policies based on best practices (top-down) and simultaneously encourages participatory development (bottom-up). These contradictory suggestions place managers in a dilemma: Should they follow a top-down or bottom-up approach? In this research, we build on an ethnographic approach to study how an innovative engineering company (MachineryCorp) managed the contradiction when the firm developed an InfoSec policy. Drawing on the dialectical theory of organisations as a lens, the findings suggest the InfoSec policy development is a recurrent process consisting of three phases: (1) drawing interpretations of InfoSec requirements from best practices (deductive adoption) and (2) constructing possibilities for local implementation (inductive adjustment) (3) that engender tensions between best practices and local contingencies facilitating innovative local resolutions (synthetic innovation). We call this process abductive innovation. At MachineryCorp, a triangle of tensions surfaced due to economic realities, infrastructure affordances, and social arrangements, and were necessary in explaining how the InfoSec policy gradually and iteratively materialised and resulted in an organisationally contingent policy.",Niemimaa M.; Niemimaa E.,Journal,European Journal of Information Systems,2019-09-03,University of Jyväskylä,abductive innovation ;  Anat Hovav ;  ethnography ;  Information security policy development ;  ISS policy ;  Michael Myers
Innovative street design in a city without freeways: the case of Vancouver,"Vancouver has no freeways and is considered highly walkable. To move traffic on streets but retain pedestrian friendliness, the city uses pedestrian activated half signals where minor streets intersect arterials, involving signal lights for the arterials and stop signs for the minor streets. Having both controls at an intersection is discouraged by widely adopted traffic engineering standards because of the complexity it creates. Inspired by ‘safety in complexity’ literature, this paper presents research exploring how these ‘multi-controlled’ intersections are deployed and work in practice, and their safety records. Findings suggest they are not unsafe and users adapt to their complexity.",Macdonald E.,Journal,Journal of Urban Design,2019-09-03,"University of California, Berkeley",
Motivation increase of mathematics students in Engineering-A proposal from Game Based Learning,"Training and capacity building for students in engineering programs, including developing competencies and skills in mathematics, have been well-established in literature. There is less known about lowering rates of desertion (understood as the non-completion of an academic program). While it is generally agreed that there are multiple causes (individual, institutional, and state), several authors suggest that low academic results and low motivation in an educational process are important causes. In the case of Santo Tomás University, the site of study for this research project, the desertion index in engineering programs is close to 45%. The course with the highest failure rates is introductory mathematics (offered in the first year). Given this context, this research project proposed innovative pedagogical strategies and mediations, targeting the motivation indexes of university-aged students enrolled in mathematics courses. Game-based learning and mixed methods were employed to design a set of two didactic strategies: (A) Kahoot Online Testing Tool, and (B) Online Crossword. The target population was represented by 20 students enrolled in a differential calculus course, as part of the first-year engineering program. For benchmarking purposes, the participants were given a diagnostic calculus test. Next, an adaptation of Instructional Material Motivation Survey was applied, which allowed me to measure the dimensions of attention, confidence, satisfaction, and relevance. The results demonstrated that the pedagogical innovation positively impacted student motivation. The most significant results include the importance of planning rigorous learning activities, incorporating problems from the real student environment, and the importance of offering immediate feedback.",Zabala-Vargas S.; Garcia-Mora L.; Ardila-Segovia D.; De Benito-Crosetti B.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 2019 International Symposium on Engineering Accreditation and Education, ICACIT 2019",2019-09-01,Universidad Santo Tomás;Universitat de les Illes Balears,ARCS Model ;  Desertion ;  Engineering Students ;  Game Based Learning ;  Maths learning ;  Motivation

The role of ICT in teaching processes in Bulgarian schools,"As the twenty-first century is dominated by information and communication technologies (ICT), they are a fundamental factor for innovation both in social and economic sectors. Education has an essential role in this process, as it is responsible for the establishment of the necessary knowledge and skills in students today, who will be the key driver in future development. ICT has been widely introduced to school programs for students to learn, but the meaningful integration of technology into classrooms is not strongly evident. Until recently, the use of these technologies in education practice is not explored in details. Many studies point out that teachers are the key determinant to the effective use of ICT in teaching practice. However, the issue of how students perceive the efforts of teachers in this direction have to be further explored. There are a lot of related studies worldwide, but very few empirical research has been done to investigate this issue in the context of Bulgaria. The authors make a scientific study on the role and impact of ICT to comprehensively demonstrate the effects of technology tools on the learning process. For that purpose, a survey that applies multiple case study methodology is performed, where both teachers and school students were the units of sampling used. The goal is to explore their views concerning the impact and importance of technology in education. The presented research formalizes and assesses the main aspects that refer to the use of new technologies in the education process. The current paper focuses on several issues concerning the application of ICT resources and tools in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and other subjects. The results point to the importance of providing appropriate conditions for effective teaching, so teachers can employ a wide range of technology resources to support many different pedagogical strategies to enhance the comprehension of students.",Paunova-Hubenova E.; Terzieva V.; Todorova K.,Conference Proceeding,"29th Annual Conference of the European Association for Education in Electrical and Information Engineering, EAEEIE 2019 - Proceedings",2019-09-01,"Institute of Information and Communication Technologies, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences",Adoption of ICT ;  Bulgarian schools ;  Classroom practice ;  ICT resources ;  Views of teachers

Investigating mental models of mechanical engineering students,"Today's innovation processes are interdisciplinary and require communication between stakeholders from different domains. The compatibility of mental models, which determine how individuals think about technical problems, decides the success of this communication. Previous research indicates that mechanical engineering students prefer procedural over structural approaches. However, structured research into the source of this preference is rare. This paper presents a study (n = 67) that investigates the mental models of mechanical engineering students of technical systems. Results indicate that mental models may depend on the presentation of a problem. A questionnaire yielded a preference for a procedural approach, while questions prompting verbal information instead yield a structural preference.",Loch F.; Vogel-Heuser B.; Reinhold F.; Bock S.; Hofer S.; Reiss K.,Conference Proceeding,"2019 18th International Conference on Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training, ITHET 2019",2019-09-01,Technische Universität München,Engineering education ;  Interdisciplinary collaboration ;  Mental Models ;  Programming paradigms
Hands-On Games for Motivating Students' Math Training,"The paper dwells on hands-on computer games to promote students' motivation when studying mathematics. The authors emphasize the necessity of consistent actualizing of practice covering university math study. The revision is possible if students become involved in learning mathematics as active participants but not who are just imparted math skills. The required technique contains three components, which include solving applied problems, using information technologies and a kind of students' exercises innovation. The authors describe a computer game in teaching Optimization Techniques as an example used for engineering students. Solving true-to-life problems, modern information technologies and young people's passion for gadgets allows increasing their contribution to learning activities.

Design thinking in a nutshell for eliciting requirements of a business process: A case study of a design thinking workshop,"The design thinking (DT) method has gained interest among software development organizations that strive towards better realization of user experience by building relationships, observing user behavior, and understanding user needs. Previous studies addressed the importance of DT in software-intensive development projects, mainly for realizing fuzzy needs of different stakeholders, better understanding problems before rushing to solutions, and enhancing creativity in innovation processes. The present research investigated whether and how a small dose of DT, e.g. a workshop, can facilitate requirements elicitation of an organization's business process. The paper presents an exploratory case study of a DT workshop on procurement process requirements conducted in a large technological organization specializing in the de-velopment of hardware and software systems. The study revealed that applying the DT method and tools promoted the discussion among the various stakeholders and allowed different voices to be heard, leading to new requirements regarding the business process, from both human and technical perspectives. Following the case study, we propose a general DT workshop for addressing business challenges. We argue that such a workshop can foster creativity and innovation in the context of business process requirements elicitation, addressing both human and technical concerns.",Levy M.; Huli C.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Requirements Engineering,2019-09-01,Shenkar College of Engineering and Design Israel,Business process ;  Design thinking ;  Procurement process ;  Requirements elicitation
Operationalising Responsible Research and Innovation - tools for enterprises,"Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) is an emerging paradigm and a novel approach to governing science and innovation with the aim of making them ethically acceptable and socially desirable. RRI concept has become a popular term as a result of making it a cross-cutting theme for the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme. Up to date, research on the topic has focused on conceptual problems (relation with similar concepts as well as ethical, moral, philosophical, cultural underpinnings and assumptions) and on the possibilities of making the concept relevant to the Research & Innovation community in Europe and worldwide. Despite some initial efforts, there is still a need to further develop methods and techniques that could make RRI a useful framework for conducting innovation activities, especially in the business environment. The aim of this paper is to propose a range of approaches that help operationalise RRI. The approaches employ methods such as weighted indicators, maturity models and scorecards.",Nazarko L.; Melnikas B.,Journal,Engineering Management in Production and Services,2019-09-01,Vilniaus Gedimino Technikos Universitetas,engineering ;  innovation ;  responsibility ;  Responsible Research and Innovation ;  Technology Assessment ;  technology management
Point-of-Care Technology Research Network: An evolving model for collaborative translational research in biomedical engineering,"As the healthcare system evolves from a centralized, hospital- and office-based model to an emphasis on patient-centric care delivered in decentralized settings from the community and/or home to low resource settings domestically and internationally, some Point-of-Care Technologies (POCT) have become important and others may soon become important in facilitating care. These portable diagnostic and monitoring devices enable moving care closer to the patient. We review recent developments in a national model to accelerate the development of POCT, specifically the Point-of-Care Technology Research Network (POCTRN), comprising a multi-center scientific network supported by a coordinating center. We summarize the history of the Network, and then describe the primary objectives and key activities of the Network and highlight the role of a new coordinating center providing administrative and infrastructure support.

"Moving forward in stem education, challenges and innovations in senior high school in the Philippines: The case of Northern Iloilo polytechnic state college","This qualitative research focused on school experiences of 20 females and 14 males senior high school (SHS) students majoring in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) in Northern Iloilo Polytechnic State College (NIPSC), the Philippines from Academic Year 2017-2018 and 2018-2019. This study aimed to identify both the positive and negative points on Senior High School (SHS)-Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) track in terms of curriculum, instructional materials, laboratory equipment, faculty educational qualification, research output and courses to be taken in NIPSC of SHS-STEM students. Purposive sampling was used for the selection of the informants. Interview, focus group discussion, and observation were employed in the study. The students’ responses in the interview revealed teachers’ qualifications and their passion for enhancing SHS-STEM curriculum. Besides, the availability of facilities was a strong point of NIPSC as a model school in implementing STEM curriculum in the district. However, lack of time management for teachers to hold classes, limited science textbooks and classroom, and unavailability of the laboratory for hands-on activities need proper attention by concern authorities. Around 46% of SHS-STEM graduates take civil engineering at NIPSC because of the well-trained teachers, and the high rating in board examination. Also, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) allowed non-STEM to enroll in science-related courses, and the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) allowed them to apply for the scholarship program. However, the bridging program is a waste of time, effort, and money for both teachers and students. NIPSC as a model school in SHS-STEM track has to enhance facilities as well as the guidance office to correctly assist students in future endeavors and to take courses similar to their tracks and interests.",Tupas F.; Matsuura T.,Journal,Jurnal Pendidikan IPA Indonesia,2019-09-01,Northern Iloilo State University;Hokkaido University of Education;Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,Engineering and mathematics (STEM) ;  Philippines ;  Science ;  Senior high school (SHS) ;  Technology

Potential Technologies Review: A hybrid information retrieval framework to accelerate demand-pull innovation in biomedical engineering,"Launching biomedical innovations based on clinical demands instead of translating basic research findings to practice reduces the risk that the results will not fit the clinical routine. To realize this type of innovation, a meta‐analysis of the body of research is necessary to reveal demand‐matching concepts. However, both the data deluge and the narrow time constraints for innovation make it impossible to perform such reviews manually. Thus, this paper proposes a specifically adapted “Potential Technologies Review” approach focusing on automated text mining and information retrieval techniques. The novel framework combines features from both systematic and scoping reviews. It aims at high coverage and reproducibility while mapping technologies—even with a fuzzy initial scope. To achieve these goals for search and triage, a set of closely interrelated methods has been developed: (a) automated query optimization, (b) screening prioritization, and (c) recall estimation. To determine appropriate parameters, a variety of published literature corpora were used and compared with an evaluation on a real‐world dataset. Our results show that it is feasible to automate the identification of relevant works using this newly introduced framework. It achieved a workload reduction of up to 91% “Work‐saved‐over Sampling (WSS)” with a 76% overall recall compared with manually screening search results. Reducing the workload is a prerequisite for a rapid Potential Technologies Review when conducting demand‐pull innovations. Moreover, it facilitates the updating and closer monitoring of latest findings. Studying the robustness of the framework and expanding it to patent documents are future tasks.",Schmitz T.; Bukowski M.; Koschmieder S.; Schmitz-Rode T.; Farkas R.,Journal,Research Synthesis Methods,2019-09-01,Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen,cross-validation ;  information retrieval ;  text mining ;  vector space model ;  WSS score

"Learning better generative models for dexterous, single-view grasping of novel objects","This paper concerns the problem of how to learn to grasp dexterously, so as to be able to then grasp novel objects seen only from a single viewpoint. Recently, progress has been made in data-efficient learning of generative grasp models that transfer well to novel objects. These generative grasp models are learned from demonstration (LfD). One weakness is that, as this paper shall show, grasp transfer under challenging single-view conditions is unreliable. Second, the number of generative model elements increases linearly in the number of training examples. This, in turn, limits the potential of these generative models for generalization and continual improvement. In this paper, it is shown how to address these problems. Several technical contributions are made: (i) a view-based model of a grasp; (ii) a method for combining and compressing multiple grasp models; (iii) a new way of evaluating contacts that is used both to generate and to score grasps. Together, these improve grasp performance and reduce the number of models learned. These advances, in turn, allow the introduction of autonomous training, in which the robot learns from self-generated grasps. Evaluation on a challenging test set shows that, with innovations (i)–(iii) deployed, grasp transfer success increases from 55.1% to 81.6%. By adding autonomous training this rises to 87.8%. These differences are statistically significant. In total, across all experiments, 539 test grasps were executed on real objects.",Kopicki M.; Belter D.; Wyatt J.,Journal,International Journal of Robotics Research,2019-09-01,University of Birmingham;Politechnika Poznanska,dexterous grasping ;  generative models ;  Learning
Young people's travel behavior – Using the life-oriented approach to understand the acceptance of autonomous driving,"The self-driving public bus (SDPB) holds the potential to replace human-operated driving with more eco-friendly means and is therefore a valuable mobility solution for our future. The SDPB is based on the innovative technology of autonomous driving, which can only be guaranteed future market success with broad enough user acceptance. This acceptance is thus an essential factor for the growth of SDPB services. In this context, the travel behavior of young people is particularly interesting, as its development will continually demonstrate future mobility behavior trends. However, little research has been conducted regarding the best methods for motivating young people to accept SDPBs as a viable mode of travel. To address this topic, we first conducted a literature review, identifying factors that potentially influence SDPB acceptance. Subsequently, we developed a comprehensive research model based on the life-oriented approach and the technology acceptance model. This conceptualization was validated by a survey of 268 SDPB riders in real-world traffic. The results reveal several novel factors influencing the acceptance of SDPBs, in particular regarding differences in age. Our research contributes to existing research on both the life-oriented and travel behavior approaches by highlighting age differences and their importance in the field. For instance, our findings demonstrate a vital need to account for age differences when deriving policy implications for future mobility solutions.",Herrenkind B.; Nastjuk I.; Brendel A.; Trang S.; Kolbe L.,Journal,Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment,2019-09-01,Georg-August-Universität Göttingen,Acceptance research ;  Autonomous driving ;  Life-oriented approach ;  Self-driving public bus ;  Young travel behavior
Moving between material and conceptual structure: Developing a card-based method to support design for learning,"This article traces the development of a card-based method that weaves the conceptual structure of learning theories into the material practises of those involved in design for learning. Inspired by design thinking and design anthropology, this method also draws on the literature of education and the learning sciences and it is the embodiment of the ACAD framework. Developed in response to challenges encountered communicating research findings to heterogenous design teams, the ACAD cards have been used in (re)designing curricula and facilities in school and university settings in Australia and New Zealand. We argue this method supports educational innovation through abductive sensemaking or design synthesis and has the potential to support the reconciliation of material and conceptual structure in other contexts.",Yeoman P.; Carvalho L.,Journal,Design Studies,2019-09-01,The University of Sydney;Massey University,collaborative design ;  design for learning ;  design methods ;  epistemology ;  framing
Measuring the Factors that Influence the Diffusion of Prefabricated Construction Technology Innovation,"Prefabricated construction (PC) is considered to be a solution for construction unsustainability. Promotion of PC is based on measuring the influencing factors for the diffusion of prefabricated construction technology innovation (PCTI). Therefore, this study explored the influencing factors and underpinned mechanism for the diffusion of PCTI from the perspective of construction enterprises’ adoption, with two dimensions of internal and external. A conceptual model with nine hypotheses was first established. Then, this study conducted a questionnaire survey of 119 construction enterprises across the PC industry, and made an empirical analysis using structural equation model (SEM), to test the model. The results found that both construction enterprises and governments play significant roles in the diffusion of PCTI while agencies and consumers do not. Besides, network power of construction enterprises plays a mediating role in the relationship. This study provides decision-making assistances for different stakeholders in the PC industry.",Dou Y.; Xue X.; Zhao Z.; Jiang Y.,Journal,KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering,2019-09-01,Guangzhou University;Harbin Institute of Technology,influencing factors ;  mediating effect ;  prefabricated construction (PC) ;  structural equation model (SEM) ;  technology innovation diffusion
"Learning based on flipped classroom with just-in-time teaching, Unity3D, gamification and educational spaces","The present study shows the impact of using flipped classroom with just-in-time teaching, Unity3D and gamification in media:scape LearnLab classrooms to make the best decisions for the mitigation of climate change, the promotion of sustainable development and rational use of energy. Climate change is perceived as a reality that we are already living, and it is considered by scientists as the greatest challenge of our times in need of immediate solutions. In Tecnologico de Monterrey, the subject, “Climate Change and Energy Use,” is taught with the objective that its students and graduates are capable of proposing solutions to these problems. Nevertheless, some students view the course as a formality and do not attach real importance to it. Therefore, the objective of this research is to verify that learning increased significantly due to the course contents including a challenge to be resolved. A mixed-research methodology was applied, which allowed the collection, analysis and linkage of qualitative and quantitative data in the same study. The measuring instruments used were quizzes, focus groups and rubrics. The results obtained demonstrated the potential of the tools applied as learning strategies. The average grades in the evaluations improved notably compared with those who took the course with the traditional methodology.",Toriz E.,Journal,International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing,2019-09-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Climate change ;  Educational innovation ;  Educational research in engineering ;  Flipped classroom with just-in-time teaching ;  Sustainable development ;  Unity3D and gamification
Use of new tailored and engineered materials for matrix solid-phase dispersion,"Matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD) is a nowadays widely accepted technique for the one-step extraction and purification of organic analytes in different research areas. The several innovations incorporated since its introduction 30 years ago have progressively contributed to increase its simplicity, flexibility, rapidity, robustness and straightforward nature. In recent years, progress in MSPD has continued through the incorporation of new engineered and tailored sorbents and solvents to the process, which have facilitated its miniaturization due to the enhanced sorption capacities and improved selectivity provided by these reagents. In some cases, these improved features have also stimulated the combined use of MSPD with other enhanced solvent extraction techniques, resulting in even faster, greener and less manipulative methodologies. This review paper discusses recent advances in these fields through representative application studies dealing with the analysis of organic compounds in environmental and food samples.",Ramos L.,Journal,TrAC - Trends in Analytical Chemistry,2019-09-01,CSIC - Instituto de Química Orgánica General (IQOG),Extraction ;  Matrix solid-phase extraction ;  Novel solvents ;  Novel sorbents ;  Sample preparation
Nanoscale integration of single cell biologics discovery processes using optofluidic manipulation and monitoring,"The new and rapid advancement in the complexity of biologics drug discovery has been driven by a deeper understanding of biological systems combined with innovative new therapeutic modalities, paving the way to breakthrough therapies for previously intractable diseases. These exciting times in biomedical innovation require the development of novel technologies to facilitate the sophisticated, multifaceted, high-paced workflows necessary to support modern large molecule drug discovery. A high-level aspiration is a true integration of “lab-on-a-chip” methods that vastly miniaturize cellulmical experiments could transform the speed, cost, and success of multiple workstreams in biologics development. Several microscale bioprocess technologies have been established that incrementally address these needs, yet each is inflexibly designed for a very specific process thus limiting an integrated holistic application. A more fully integrated nanoscale approach that incorporates manipulation, culture, analytics, and traceable digital record keeping of thousands of single cells in a relevant nanoenvironment would be a transformative technology capable of keeping pace with today's rapid and complex drug discovery demands. The recent advent of optical manipulation of cells using light-induced electrokinetics with micro- and nanoscale cell culture is poised to revolutionize both fundamental and applied biological research. In this review, we summarize the current state of the art for optical manipulation techniques and discuss emerging biological applications of this technology. In particular, we focus on promising prospects for drug discovery workflows, including antibody discovery, bioassay development, antibody engineering, and cell line development, which are enabled by the automation and industrialization of an integrated optoelectronic single-cell manipulation and culture platform. Continued development of such platforms will be well positioned to overcome many of the challenges currently associated with fragmented, low-throughput bioprocess workflows in biopharma and life science research.",Jorgolli M.; Nevill T.; Winters A.; Chen I.; Chong S.; Lin F.; Mock M.; Chen C.; Le K.; Tan C.; Jess P.; Xu H.; Hamburger A.; Stevens J.; Munro T.; Wu M.; Tagari P.; Miranda L.,Journal,Biotechnology and Bioengineering,2019-09-01,"University of California, Berkeley;Amgen Incorporated;Berkeley Lights, Inc.;Drug Discovery",advanced biotechnology ;  bioassay development ;  digital cell biology ;  drug discovery ;  nanoscale cell culture ;  optical manipulation techniques ;  single cell technology
Psychosocial and cognitive engineering contributions to blood transfusion,"Among the research developed in social psychology, there is a field of study questioning the mechanisms that explain prosocial behaviors. In 1956, the first links between transfusion medicine and social psychology were formed, with the study of underlying motivations to blood donation behavior. Sixty years later, the number of “fundamental” and “applied” research has widely increased, and we now have a theoretical understanding of blood donation engagement's levers, as well as experimental demonstrations of methods to activate these levers. Thus, the literature offers several strategies experimentally verified to improve the recruitment and retaining of blood donors. These methods can go from specific speeches when soliciting donors, to changes in the blood donation environment, etc. They aim either at impacting the donation experience, at obtaining a change in the donor's behavior, or at changing the determinants of blood donation. Yet, it is clear that the knowledge from the research in social psychology is not really deployed on the field by the organizations that could benefit from it. In this article, we will try to develop the difficulty regarding the application of fundamental and experimental knowledge, and to underline the implications for the blood transfusion establishments. We will then present the psychosocial and cognitive engineering method, and argue its relevance to answer this problematic.",Beurel A.; Terrade F.; Lebaudy J.; Danic B.,Journal,Transfusion Clinique et Biologique,2019-09-01,Etablissement Français du Sang;Université Rennes 2,Blood transfusion ;  Organizational change ;  Psychosocial engineering
A framework and implementation of Customer Platform-connection manufactory to service (CPMS) model in product service system,"With the continuous improvement of living standards, customers are gradually pursuing products which are individualization and entertainment. The traditional large-scale manufacturing mode cannot meet the individual needs of customers. The production mode of the enterprises has been changed from the traditional inventory mode to the customization manufacturing mode driven by the customer orders. Furthermore, the simple customization model cannot meet the industrial needs in the open and networked era. Therefore, there is a lack of an innovative manufacturing mode that not only meets the individual needs of customers, but also adapts to today's open and networked environment. In this paper, a new customization model was proposed, which is a continuously improved customization model called CPMS (Customer Platform-connection Manufactory to Service). By means of research methodology of literature review and analysis, the birth, concept, and evolution of CPMS in PSS are discussed. Through analysing the development of industry, combining with the existing analysis and projects we involved in, and the method of system engineering analysis, an overall framework of CPMS model is derived. At last, a case study for implementation of CPMS in the car industry has been given. Under this model, enterprises can improve the flexible production capacity of production line, reduce the production cost, reduce inventory, improve the modular configuration of products, and etc. Moreover, it can provide some reference value for enterprises to plan, design, implement and apply a new customization production model that conform to the requirements of the new era of open and networked.",Zhang X.; Ming X.; Liu Z.; Qu Y.; Yin D.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2019-09-01,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Customer to business (C2B) ;  Manufacturing system ;  Mass customization ;  Model innovation ;  Personalized customization ;  Product service system (PSS)

Experiential learning at Lean-Thinking-Learning Space,"This research paper presents a proposal for a learning model that extends the availability of resources for training and development of professional skills in the field of Lean Manufacturing. This research arises due to the lack and current limitations of effective teaching models for the development of professional competencies. The importance of this educational innovation proposal lies in being a unique reference frame of its type. This offers cutting-edge methods for optimization and process improvement tools, while developing general and disciplinary competencies in the area of industrial engineering. The notion of learning is presented in a context of real-world experiences to develop relevant competencies in real businesses settings for manufacturing and services. This work presents a literature review on competency-based education, experiential learning and challenge-based learning. Therefore, a background explanation of the proposed learning model and a learning space called Lean-Thinking-Learning Space are elaborated. Additionally, an experiment carried out to measure the development of competencies is showed in terms of comparing the teaching results of a course in two different learning spaces; namely, a traditional classroom and the proposed experiential learning space.

Influence of the method used in the generation of valid engineering concepts,"Innovative products are almost a necessity nowadays; however, educational institutions do not have reliable data about which methods should be instructed, nor how. For this reason, the objective of this research is to quantify the relevance of the selected design method when generating concepts in the early stages of design. To compare the performance of structured and intuitive methods to generate ideas, a two-stage experiment was applied in two contexts in which were evaluated novelty, variety, quality and quantity. First, participants were asked to solve a problem using a recently taught method. The aim was to obtain insights about the influence of each method. Second, all participants were asked to solve a new problem after being taught four chosen methods, the goal being to obtain insights about the team’s circumstances. In general, the best results were obtained with structured methods, which simultaneously were also the least preferred by students, probably due to the ease of implementation associated with the alternative type of methods; namely, intuitive. Additionally, the study investigated other significant effects, such as the length of time of the experiments and the timing of each stage, as well as the effects of the particular context in which the experiment occurred. Considering the two types of methods, for example, an organization focused on structured methods could benefit from using those methods periodically, increasing its “tool dexterity” ability, while an organization focused on intuitive methods could emphasize the background of the users, namely the “user capacities”. Since those trends—and others—were similar for both problems in both contexts, it is natural to ask which changes could modify these tendencies. Changing the problem’s complexity and reaching to a more diverse universe of participants could be a good step towards having more confidence in the deduction of general design principles to generate ideas for solving real world challenges.",Duran-Novoa R.; Lozoya-Santos J.; Ramírez-Mendoza R.; Torres-Benoni F.; Vargas-Martínez A.,Journal,International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing,2019-09-01,Universidad de Santiago de Chile;Universidad de Monterrey;Tecnológico de Monterrey,Design methods ;  Educational innovation ;  KJ technique ;  SCAMPER ;  TRIZ
A comparison of fog and cloud computing cyber-physical interfaces for Industry 4.0 real-time embedded machine learning engineering applications,"Industrial cyber-physical systems are the primary enabling technology for Industry 4.0, which combine legacy industrial and control engineering, with emerging technology paradigms (e.g. big data, internet-of-things, artificial intelligence, and machine learning), to derive self-aware and self-configuring factories capable of delivering major production innovations. However, the technologies and architectures needed to connect and extend physical factory operations to the cyber world have not been fully resolved. Although cloud computing and service-oriented architectures demonstrate strong adoption, such implementations are commonly produced using information technology perspectives, which can overlook engineering, control and Industry 4.0 design concerns relating to real-time performance, reliability or resilience. Hence, this research compares the latency and reliability performance of cyber-physical interfaces implemented using traditional cloud computing (i.e. centralised), and emerging fog computing (i.e. decentralised) paradigms, to deliver real-time embedded machine learning engineering applications for Industry 4.0. The findings highlight that despite the cloud's highly scalable processing capacity, the fog's decentralised, localised and autonomous topology may provide greater consistency, reliability, privacy and security for Industry 4.0 engineering applications, with the difference in observed maximum latency ranging from 67.7%–99.4%. In addition, communication failures rates highlighted differences in both consistency and reliability, with the fog interface successfully responding to 900,000 communication requests (i.e. 0% failure rate), and the cloud interface recording failure rates of 0.11%, 1.42%, and 6.6% under varying levels of stress.",O'Donovan P.; Gallagher C.; Leahy K.; O'Sullivan D.,Journal,Computers in Industry,2019-09-01,University College Cork,Cyber-physical systems ;  Embedded analytics ;  Emerging architectures ;  Engineering informatics ;  Industrial analytics ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Machine learning

Knowledge to money: Assessing the business performance effects of publicly-funded R&D grants,"UK Research Councils (UKRCs) spend around £3bn pa supporting R&D and innovation. We provide a comprehensive assessment of these grants on the performance of participating UK firms, using data on all projects funded by UKRCs over the 2004–2016 period and applying a propensity score matching approach. We exploit the richness of the data available in the Gateway to Research database by investigating the heterogeneous effect of these projects across several novel directions which have not been explored before. We find a positive effect on the employment and turnover growth of participating firms, both in the short and in the medium term. Exploring impacts across different types of firms we find stronger performance impacts for firms in R&D intensive industries and for smaller and less productive firms. We also consider how impacts vary depending on the characteristics of the funded research projects in terms of partners characteristics, receipt of other research grants and grant value. Finally, we focus on the different sources of grants, analysing in particular the evolution in the funding strategy of Innovate UK. Our results have implications for the extent and targeting of future Research Council funding both in the UK and elsewhere.",Vanino E.; Roper S.; Becker B.,Journal,Research Policy,2019-09-01,Aston Business School;Warwick Business School;London School of Economics and Political Science,Innovation ;  Public support ;  R&D ;  Research Council ;  UK
Designing a teaching guide for the use of simulations in undergraduate robotics courses: a pilot study,"In the educational area of engineering, there has been research using simulations to illustrate the concepts and exercises seen in class, as in the case of robotics course classes in which simulations have been used to demonstrate theoretical concepts. Results have been inconclusive whether or not the use of state-of-the-art simulations with traditional teaching methods improve the academic performance of students. From the point of view of the authors, some of these negative results could be because teachers do not receive any guidance on how to incorporate the use of simulations in their teaching strategy. This paper reports the evaluation of a platform to simulate industrial robots based on the MATLAB™ and Simulink™ environment. The platform was used by 3 teachers of undergraduate robotics courses. Each teacher was trained how to use the platform. For teachers of groups A and B, in addition to this training, they also received guidance on how to use the platform in their classes, while the teacher of group C freely decided on his own how to use the platform in his classes. In each group, the teacher covered the same topics about forward kinematics, and the same exercises were given to the students to solve during the practical sessions. As a result, students in groups A and B attained better academic performance compared to students of group C. This fact shows that it is necessary to train the professors not only in the use of the platform but also in the incorporation of this technology into their courses.",González-García S.; Rodríguez-Arce J.; Loreto-Gómez G.; Montaño-Serrano V.,Journal,International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing,2019-09-01,Instituto Tecnológico Superior de Uruapan;Tecnológico de Monterrey;Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México,3D simulations ;  Educational innovation ;  Educational platforms ;  Teaching strategy ;  Tools for teaching
"Active learning in engineering education. A review of fundamentals, best practices and experiences","Universities and international organizations are adopting and promoting Active Learning strategies, respectively. Reasons are varied, including that this approach has proven to prepare competitive students who are skilled to address the main problems of society once they enter the labor market. Active Learning is a student-centered-learning approach that involves the learner directly in the process. It consists of letting students be the main actors of the learning process by performing meaningful activities and critically thinking about what they are doing. In this research, a review of Active Learning is performed. The focus is on presenting concepts and practices central to Active Learning that leading universities are deploying, universities such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology, North Carolina State University and Aalborg University. Also, the authors describe in this paper a case from their experience with Active Learning techniques in specified areas of engineering education at Tecnologico de Monterrey. Results indicate that this approach supports the development of in-demand competencies such as Teamwork, Problem-solving and Analysis. In addition, students’ performance and retention rates are improved. In the engineering field, students can acquire and practice different technical skills under supervision. Active Learning is a very flexible approach that can be integrated in a gradual manner by any organization. The authors have constructed this research to be a useful guide to Active Learning practices. It can support engineering professors and people interested in knowing or adopting this approach for improving their students’ results.",Hernández-de-Menéndez M.; Vallejo Guevara A.; Tudón Martínez J.; Hernández Alcántara D.; Morales-Menendez R.,Journal,International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing,2019-09-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Active learning ;  Challenge based learning ;  Educational innovation ;  Engineering education ;  Leading universities’ practices
Virtual reality laboratories: a review of experiences,"Laboratory experiences are critical to the learning process across all domains of engineering, due to the fact that information technology has changed the educational laboratory landscape. Three general laboratory types are found in engineering education; namely, hands-on, virtual and remote; each of them with its own advantages and drawbacks. In this paper, various types of university laboratories around the world are described to present the updated state-of-the-art. Additionally, a discussion regarding the educational effectiveness of each laboratory format is discussed. Finally, a case study of the development and implementation of virtual reality laboratories and remote labs at Tecnologico de Monterrey is presented. Early results have demonstrated that the virtual labs are a viable option to complement and/or replace hands-on labs, mainly because of their low investment, low maintenance costs and ease of replication to meet user demand and, above all, because of their great impact on the new teaching paradigms, where it is necessary to encourage active learning and the development of skills based on challenges. In addition to reviewing the most characteristic learning outcomes of each type of laboratory, different elements that influence the success of teaching and learning processes, such as presence, belief, and collaboration, etc., are reviewed. We hope that this research will serve as a guide for designs of individual, blended or hybrid types of laboratories used for experimental teaching in engineering education.",Hernández-de-Menéndez M.; Vallejo Guevara A.; Morales-Menendez R.,Journal,International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing,2019-09-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Educational innovation ;  Engineering education ;  Hands-on labs ;  Remote labs ;  Virtual labs

The need is to identify the research status and explore where this new set of technologies effectively can be deployed. Methods: Research articles till September 2018 are searched from Scopus by keywords as “4D printing” and “4D printing""""medical"" and undertaken a bibliometric analysis of the identified papers. Further relevant papers were studied for application in the medical field. Results: Search through Scopus identified 171 research articles on 4D printing and 13 research articles on 4D printing in the medical field. This study states that 4D printing is the latest technology that creates innovation and addresses complex medical problems. Paper briefly describes the 4D printing and details its difference from 3D printing technology. We have identified five steps to be used to create a medical model by using this technology and its prospective implementation for medical applications. Identified that research is carried out on 4D printing, but decidedly less publication is available in the medical field reporting the application of this technology. Finally, we have identified nine significant applications of 4D printing in the medical field. The main limitation is that it requires extensive investment & support for transformation. Conclusions: 4D printing is to provide benefits to medical practitioners especially in the areas not covered by 3D printing technologies. 4D printing helps to create a 3D physical object by adding smart material layer by layer through computer-operated computer-aided design (CAD) data. It adds a dimension of transformation over time where printed products are sensitive to parameters like temperature, humidity, time etc. This technology can provide extensive support in the medical field, especially with better and smart medical implants, tools and devices. Now doctors and researchers can explore with 4D printing technology to provide better service to the patient.",Javaid M.; Haleem A.,Journal,Clinical Epidemiology and Global Health,2019-09-01,Jamia Millia Islamia,3D printing ;  4D printing ;  Customisation ;  Implant ;  Medical applications ;  Smart material
Discovering and forecasting interactions in big data research: A learning-enhanced bibliometric study,"As one of the most impactful emerging technologies, big data analytics and its related applications are powering the development of information technologies and are significantly shaping thinking and behavior in today's interconnected world. Exploring the technological evolution of big data research is an effective way to enhance technology management and create value for research and development strategies for both government and industry. This paper uses a learning-enhanced bibliometric study to discover interactions in big data research by detecting and visualizing its evolutionary pathways. Concentrating on a set of 5840 articles derived from Web of Science covering the period between 2000 and 2015, text mining and bibliometric techniques are combined to profile the hotspots in big data research and its core constituents. A learning process is used to enhance the ability to identify the interactive relationships between topics in sequential time slices, revealing technological evolution and death.

Tracing the system transformations and innovation pathways of an emerging technology: Solid lipid nanoparticles,"Accurately evaluating opportunities in new and emerging science and technologies is a growing concern. This study proposes an integrated framework for identifying a range of potential innovation pathways and commercial applications for solid lipid nanoparticles – one particularly promising contender within the field of nano-enabled drug delivery. Several text mining techniques – term clumping, SAO technique, and net effect analysis – as well as technology roadmapping, are combined with expert judgment to identify the main areas of R&D in this field, and to track their evolution over time. Through analysis, data from multiple sources, including research publications, patents, and commercial press, reveal possible future applications and commercialization opportunities for this emerging technology. We find that research is moving away from materials and delivery outcomes toward clinical applications. The most promising markets are pharmaceuticals and cosmetics; however, the “time-to-market” is much shorter for cosmetics than it is for pharmaceuticals. The most significant contributions of this paper have been highlighted as follows. One innovation is extracting the intelligence from three kinds of data sources after in-depth considering their characteristics and matching with the features of different technology development stages to identify innovative research topics. The second one is combining SAO technique with net effect analysis to identify what the evolutionary links between research topics are, and then to use TRM to visualize the evolution of the main areas of R&D over time.",Zhou X.; Huang L.; Porter A.; Vicente-Gomila J.,Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2019-09-01,Xidian University;Georgia Institute of Technology;Beijing Institute of Technology;Universitat Politècnica de València;Search Technology Inc,New and emerging science & technology ;  Research topic identification ;  Solid lipid nanoparticles ;  Tech mining ;  Technology innovation pathways ;  Technology roadmapping

Exploring the microfoundations of end-user interests toward co-creating renewable energy technology innovations,"Energy market transition, which is enabled by new affordable energy technologies and digitalization, opens novel opportunities for developing innovative energy solutions. These new technologies facilitate energy consumers to become local energy prosumers i.e. consumers and producers of energy using renewable energy sources. Hence, a central question for innovating new solutions emerges: how energy consumers and prosumers would engage in co-creating value and novel solutions with industry players? This article explores the microfoundations of energy consumers' and prosumers’ interest to participate in co-creation activities with energy industry actors. Using survey data from five European countries and by applying variance-based structural equation modeling, we find that rewards and personal characteristics influence the interest to engage in co-creation activities. Specifically, the microfoundations of the interest are built upon the need for improvements, the intrinsic rewards, and the personal adopter characteristics. Additionally, we find differing microfoundations of interest for energy consumers and prosumers. We further discuss managerial and theoretical implications of our findings and highlight avenues for future research.",Kotilainen K.; Saari U.; Mäkinen S.; Ringle C.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2019-08-20,Waikato Management School;Tampere University;Hamburg University of Technology;Université de Lausanne (UNIL),Co-creation ;  Energy ;  Innovation ;  Prosumer ;  Rewards ;  Variance-based structural equation modeling

Bond the Gap between Academic and Industry Requirements for Undergraduate Civil Engineering Students in Iraq,"In the last twenty years, civil engineering industry has been improved significantly due to the expanded use of technology and innovations in project management. This progress represented as a challenge to universities to provide competence engineers with the right capabilities to be fit in the new job requirements and able to lead this industry to the new era. As this problem considered a global issue, it has a particular situation in Iraq. This resulted from the sharp change in the Iraqi construction industry after recent political change in 2003. This study aims to investigate the current industry expectation from graduated civil engineers and compare it with actual competences that engineers learned from their study in Iraqi universities. This research implements both a qualitative and quantitative approach to collect valuable and reliable data. This has been achieved by sending an online questionnaire to senior engineers working for both public and private organizations. In addition, another set of questions send to students to evaluate their knowledge to identify the gap. This study identified a considerable gap between current civil engineering education and industry expectation, which mainly resulted in project management skills. This gap needs to be addressed in the near future to make sure that Iraqi civil engineers maintain their chances to get hired from foreign companies and be able to lead the Iraqi construction industry to the global market.",Naji Z.; Dakhil A.; Jasim S.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2019-08-15,University of Basrah,Civil ;  Education ;  Engineering ;  Industry ;  Knowledge
A Review of Digital Transformation in Mining,"Digital transformation (DT) is the process by which entities adapt themselves to modern technology. As digital technology becomes more prevalent (automation, cameras, sensors, touchscreens, artificial intelligence, etc.), there will be increased pressure on companies to leverage it for additional gains. For many companies in the mining industry, this will involve overcoming a steep learning curve. Furthermore, as the long-term success of the mining industry is dependent on a labor force with new skills (data management, analytics, digital literacy, etc.), new curriculum will need to be appended to the mining engineering discipline. This paper considers the mining industry’s need for DT. Then, it presents a three-part review of the foundational components of the DT process–ubiquitous data, connectivity, and decision making. Finally, it provides a discussion on the future of DT in mining as well as a research direction, which identifies the need of academia to provide support for mining companies in the form of both research and the education of digitally literate, dynamically capable mining engineers into the coming decades.",Young A.; Rogers P.,Journal,"Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration",2019-08-15,The University of Utah,Analytics ;  Big data ;  Data science ;  Innovation ;  Operations technology
Characterizing industry-academia collaborations in software engineering: evidence from 101 projects,"Research collaboration between industry and academia supports improvement and innovation in industry and helps ensure the industrial relevance of academic research. However, many researchers and practitioners in the community believe that the level of joint industry-academia collaboration (IAC) projects in Software Engineering (SE) research is relatively low, creating a barrier between research and practice. The goal of the empirical study reported in this paper is to explore and characterize the state of IAC with respect to industrial needs, developed solutions, impacts of the projects and also a set of challenges, patterns and anti-patterns identified by a recent Systematic Literature Review (SLR) study. To address the above goal, we conducted an opinion survey among researchers and practitioners with respect to their experience in IAC. Our dataset includes 101 data points from IAC projects conducted in 21 different countries. Our findings include: (1) the most popular topics of the IAC projects, in the dataset, are: software testing, quality, process, and project managements; (2) over 90% of IAC projects result in at least one publication; (3) almost 50% of IACs are initiated by industry, busting the myth that industry tends to avoid IACs; and (4) 61% of the IAC projects report having a positive impact on their industrial context, while 31% report no noticeable impacts or were “not sure”. To improve this situation, we present evidence-based recommendations to increase the success of IAC projects, such as the importance of testing pilot solutions before using them in industry. This study aims to contribute to the body of evidence in the area of IAC, and benefit researchers and practitioners. Using the data and evidence presented in this paper, they can conduct more successful IAC projects in SE by being aware of the challenges and how to overcome them, by applying best practices (patterns), and by preventing anti-patterns.",Garousi V.; Pfahl D.; Fernandes J.; Felderer M.; Mäntylä M.; Shepherd D.; Arcuri A.; Coşkunçay A.; Tekinerdogan B.,Journal,Empirical Software Engineering,2019-08-15,"Kristiania University College;ABB Group, USA;Tartu Ülikool;Universidade do Minho;Blekinge Tekniska Högskola;Oulun Yliopisto;Universität Innsbruck;Wageningen University & Research;University of Calgary;Atatürk Üniversitesi",Anti-patterns ;  Best practices ;  Challenges ;  Empirical study ;  Evidence ;  Industry-academia collaborations ;  Patterns ;  Software engineering
The trend of higher engineering education towards achieving technological development,"The technical-scientific progress, rapidly evolving technologies, developing of innovative processes in the sphere of production, the effect of the economy globalization, etc. require a rethinking and complete reformatting of the education system in general and particularly, of that one related to engineering. This paper analyses development trends of higher technical education in the world and particularly in the Republic of Moldova. It is analysed the dynamic evolution of the number of students and graduates ethnic domain specifically for Moldova in order to elucidate this issue. There were realised three studies attended by students from engineering specialties, young engineering specialists and their employers. Research results highlight the key role of knowledge and skills that young professionals must possess to achieve technical performance, scientific and economic information in accordance with international standards. With an accelerated technological progress, it is clear that we are on the top of a new era of machine learning, machine doing and finally, of a true artificial intelligence (AI). It is a central point in history that presents both opportunities and challenges. And undoubtedly, the most significant social and economic impact will be on the job-it is required to determine what work will be performed and by whom. In this aspect, application of exponential technologies is analysed in order to strengthen labor and accelerate business growth, as we enter the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In this new era, the transition to innovations based on combinations of technologies, force companies to reconsider how they do business, including requirements put forward in preparing new specialists in the labor market. Their actions should be oriented in training a generation of self-motivated and responsible engineers of the highest quality, able to participate in solving societal and engineering challenges of the XXI century through creative and viable solutions.",Garbuz V.; Topala P.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2019-08-14,Alecu Russo Balti State University,
Design thinking in practice: Understanding manifestations of design thinking in software engineering,"This industry case study explores where and how Design Thinking supports software development teams in their endeavour to create innovative software solutions. Design Thinking has found its way into software companies ranging from startups to SMEs and multinationals. It is mostly seen as a human centered innovation approach or a way to elicit requirements in a more agile fashion. However, research in Design Thinking suggests that being exposed to DT changes the mindset of employees. Thus this article aims to explore the wider use of DT within software companies through a case study in a multinational organization. Our results indicate, that once trained in DT, employees find various ways to implement it not only as a pre-phase to software development but throughout their projects even applying it to aspects of their surroundings such as the development process, team spaces and team work. Specifically we present a model of how DT manifests itself in a software development company.",Dobrigkeit F.; De Paula D.,Conference Proceeding,ESEC/FSE 2019 - Proceedings of the 2019 27th ACM Joint Meeting European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering,2019-08-12,Hasso-Plattner-Institut für Softwaresystemtechnik GmbH;University of Galway,Agile Software Development ;  Case Study ;  Design Thinking
Research on Corrosion Detection and Assessment Method for Hydraulic Concrete Structures,"In our country, hydraulic concrete structure construction technology is widely used. However, with the increase of time and the erosion of the environment, there will be aging and safety risks in this structure. This puts forward higher requirements for detection technology and safety assessment technology of hydraulic concrete structures. Therefore, in order to promote the innovation and progress of this engineering technology, we should carry out targeted strategy analysis based on the development and application status of related technologies and engineering practice.

Defect Engineering in 2D Perovskite by Mn(II) Doping for Light-Emitting Applications,"Low-dimensional perovskites are considered good candidates for light-emitting applications given their high exciton binding energy. Yet, single-layered two-dimensional (2D) perovskites are strongly limited by trap-assisted recombination and suffer from low luminescence yields, hampering their application in electroluminescence devices. Here, we use synthetic and defect engineering strategies to overcome such issues. We employ metallic doping (Mn2+ and Eu3+) to introduce luminescent impurities in the 2D perovskite NMA2PbX4 (NMA = 1-naphtylmethylammonium). By means of temperature-dependent and time-resolved spectroscopy, we demonstrate efficient energy transfer to Mn2+ centers. This avoids funneling of photo-excited species in inefficient recombination channels, enhancing photoluminescence and giving a quantum yield surpassing 20% in doped films. Eventually, we embody Mn-doped NMA2PbBr4 in a light-emitting diode architecture and show electroluminescence from the Mn2+ 4T1 → 6A1 transition. This proof-of-concept demonstration shows the potential of doping in layered perovskites and prompts the study of a wider range of host-guest structures. Metal halide perovskites have emerged for light-emitting applications, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs). While intensive research has focused on three-dimensional (3D) perovskites, layered perovskites are also gaining interest for their peculiar light-emitting properties. The higher exciton binding energy of low-dimensional perovskites is considered beneficial to improve the radiative recombination efficiency. However, the luminescence yield of single-layered two-dimensional (2D) perovskites is severely lowered by trap-assisted recombination. By including Mn2+ and Eu3+ in a 2D perovskite, we show that metallic doping can be exploited to enhance and tune its luminescence. Efficient energy transfer from the perovskite to the dopant is achieved, provided that a suitable energy level alignment of the host-guest system is realized. We show that such a mechanism can be exploited to tune the material's electroluminescence in a proof-of-concept LED based on a Mn-doped 2D perovskite. Cortecchia et al. report the use of metallic dopants to overcome the detrimental trap-mediated non-radiative recombination processes, lowering the luminescence yield in two-dimensional perovskites. This results in tuning and enhancement of the perovskite's luminescence properties. In particular, efficient energy transfer and high luminescence yield are obtained with manganese doping. This strategy is shown to be suitable for application in light-emitting diodes.",Cortecchia D.; Mróz W.; Neutzner S.; Borzda T.; Folpini G.; Brescia R.; Petrozza A.,Journal,Chem,2019-08-08,Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia,"1-naphtylmethylammonium ;  2D perovskite ;  doping ;  energy transfer ;  europium ;  LED ;  manganese ;  SDG7: Affordable and clean energy ;  SDG9: Industry, innovation, and infrastructure ;  triplet"

Evaluation of the OIRE Method in a Case Study,"To (semi-)automatically classify user needs collected from online open sources, we propose the Open Innovation in Requirements Engineering (OIRE) method. OIRE is mimicking the well-known Kano-model exclusively using data from online reviews instead of conducting interviews with select focus groups. In our previous research, we introduced the design, implementation and preliminary validation of the OIRE method. In this paper, we introduce the tool support for the OIRE method, OIRE-System (OIRE-S), and evaluate the OIRE method using OIRE-S. For that purpose, we conducted a case study with two Chinese companies using OIRE-S as tool support when applying the OIRE method. Based on the results of the case study, we conclude that the analysis results of the OIRE method provide valuable information for stakeholders and, thus, is useful to decision-makers in the industry, in particular as a complement to traditional requirement elicitation and analysis activities.",Yin H.; Pfahl D.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 45th Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications, SEAA 2019",2019-08-01,Tartu Ülikool,Case study ;  Kano model ;  Kano-like model ;  OIRE
Research on Isolation Technology of Aseptic Process Equipment in Pharmaceutical Industry,"With the continuous innovation and development of science and technology, the level of biomedical technology has been effectively improved. In the process of pharmaceutical manufacturing, the requirements for clean technology have been continuously improved, and the aseptic process equipment isolation technology has been effectively applied. This paper mainly discusses the importance of applying aseptic isolation technology from the perspective of aseptic isolation technology, expounds the aseptic isolation technology in the pharmaceutical industry, and conducts detailed analysis from three angles. The traditional PID control algorithm has simple structure, convenient adjustment and wide application. However, there are also many shortcomings. The quality of drug production varies greatly.

Building a socio-technological innovation system for african-american owned enterprises: Calibrating the agent-based model,"Many surveys reported that African-American enterprises are underrepresented in high-tech innovations and ventures. Inequalities in personal wealth, relatively low levels of enrollment in science and engineering programs, and historically conditioned cultural factors affecting behavior contribute to a lack of African-American high-tech entrepreneurial identity. An agent-based model to simulate African-American high-tech enterprises was developed to identify patterns of successful innovation that could lead to new product development. The goal of this research is to calibrate the agent-based model using case studies. The model includes five types of interactive autonomous agents that comprise a complex innovation system. Through simulation, the causal relationship between elements of the model can be identified to determine factors that lead to the limited representation of African-Americans as owners of high-tech enterprises. By using case studies, the calibration of the model can recommend actions and policies to increase African-American representation in high-tech industries as well as validate the model.",London J.; Sheikh N.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2019 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Technology Management in the World of Intelligent Systems, Proceedings",2019-08-01,School of Engineering,
Technological capacity building through the establishment and management of technological organization in developing countries: A case study of nepal technology innovation center in Nepal,"The technological capacity building is one of the critical factors for the national development in developing countries. Especially, the establishment and management of relevant technological organization is a prerequisite for the technological capacity building in one's nation. In developing countries, not like developed countries, there are more factors to consider in the establishment of technological organization such as governance issue and sustainability. In this paper, the case of National Technology Innovation Center in Katmandu University, which is supported by Korean International Cooperation Agency, is analyzed. In the technology transfer related literature, it is argued that the absorptive capacity and transfer capacity are important in external technology learning and commercializing process. The case study shows that the absorptive capacity of developing country and transfer capacity of donor country are important as noted in the literature. In addition, the willingness to learn from the recipient organization is also critical in utilizing foreign technological aids. Even the study of one country case is not enough, it will give some practical knowledge to understand the establishment of technological infrastructure in the developing countries.",Yim D.; Kim W.; Kim E.; Cho H.; Song C.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2019 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Technology Management in the World of Intelligent Systems, Proceedings",2019-08-01,Science and Technology Policy Institute,
Relationship between dominant triple helix model and type of intermediary organizations,"Although there is a plethora of studies about the role of Triple/ Quadruple Helix in strengthening the local, national and regional systems of innovation, few focuses on relationship between Triple Helix model type and the intermediary organisations. The intermediary organisations are useful in facilitating knowledge, technology and skills transfer among the collaborating partners. Three main types of Triple Helix models have been identified within the literature, namely: university-push, government-led and business-driven models. The purpose of this critical literature review study is to characterise the nature of intermediary organisations in each model of Triple Helix. The preliminary findings show that there is an overlap between various Triple Helix models, hence one can rather refer to a dominant model. As a result, certain intermediary organisations have been identified as key stakeholders in several types of Triple Helix models. The roles of these organisations might be shifted between being a performer, enabler or facilitator in various type of Triple Helix models. Three case studies used a China (government-pull), Finland (business-led) and the United States (university-push). The findings of this study are useful for an in-depth understanding of the organisations and their role in triple Helix cooperation. Further empirical research can be useful in strengthening the findings of this study.",Letaba P.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2019 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Technology Management in the World of Intelligent Systems, Proceedings",2019-08-01,University of Pretoria;National Advisory Council on Innovation,

Research and technology organizations and management models: A systematic literature review,"Research and Technology Organizations (RTOs) are significant elements for National Innovation Systems (NISs), with the potential of articulating different actors for social and technological development. Although RTOs are not so often identified in innovation ecosystem studies, the literature points out difficulties in their managerial processes, especially for institutions in developing countries. Thus, this research objective is to systematically analyze the literature aiming at a better understanding about the integration between processes and resources of existing management models for RTOs as an opportunity to identify gaps and to define possible fronts of interventions. It seeks to make explicit, in a broader way, aspects that can subsidize the operationalization of NISs in developing countries. The systematic literature review was carried out from the Web of Science (WoS) and the Scopus databases and evidenced contributions related to the dynamics of the management models adopted. In spite of the unfolding in practices and structures that may favor the effectiveness of research, development and innovation (RDI), the identified models address only specific areas of management, which opens up opportunities for conducting studies that explore the systemic management of RDI in RTOs, among other deployments.",Moreno M.; Da Silva S.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2019 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Technology Management in the World of Intelligent Systems, Proceedings",2019-08-01,Universidade Federal de São Carlos,
Entrepreneurial ecosystems in Israel: The changing role of government support: A historical perspective,"Knowing that innovation is considered a driver for economic growth and employment, national innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystems in Germany, the UK and Israel were recently compared for a UK government agency to enhance their understanding. The role of government support was highlighted as having a significant impact on the resilience and robustness of technology infrastructures worldwide - and in Israel specifically [1]. Referred to as the 'Start-up Nation,' Israel and its entrepreneurial success are topics of discussion and reflection across the globe. This work, based on numerous interviews and archival research, provides insights as to how the role of the Israeli government has adapted over time to support this phenomenon. From bi-national marketing agreements to full-blown government-funded incubators and accelerators, programs and government goals have constantly changed to provide a layer of support for technology management and intelligent systems. Funding mechanisms and programing have adapted to shifting populations and target audiences. As opposed to merely summarizing history, this paper breaks events into three distinct time periods to reveal how different government programs were made available, due to changes in expectations and targets that triggered government to adapt their offerings to support changing needs. The final discussion identifies how local and national entities aim to keep pace with ever-changing needs to manage technology as well as intelligent systems to keep abreast of the increased speed of innovation. This includes the introduction of public/private support agencies intended to be more flexible and agile to meet the continuously-shifting enterprise, cluster and ecosystem needs of the country and its global outreach.",Weinberg C.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2019 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Technology Management in the World of Intelligent Systems, Proceedings",2019-08-01,Ruppin Academic Center,

Permeability in coworking-spaces as an innovation facilitator,"Contemporary organizations develop porous structures and permeable boundaries to employ external knowledge and resources. On the one hand, permeability in organizations engenders fluidity which increases organizational capabilities through adaptability, diversity, and speed. On the other hand, organizations continuously redefine and reinvent their boundaries to remain stable and to exhibit self-identity. These two competing demands of organizations to simultaneously become fluid as well as stable are evident in modern shared workplaces where organizations share offices with other organizations and professionals. The purpose of this research is to analyze how permeability in shared office spaces influence the internal work structures and processes of members' organizations who have relatively fixed memberships, stable structures, and steep hierarchies. We collected qualitative data based on an inductive research methodology from the providers and users of a coworking-space. Our study concludes that participational autonomy, spatial and virtual connectivity and interrelational heterogeneity determine the level of permeability in a coworking-space. The space level permeability influences the work structures and task processes of members' organizations. Changeability in organizational processes engenders structural differentiation, decentralization, and ad-hoc work processes, which provide autonomy to the organizational employees or independent users to define their work structures, task processes, and work routines. Organizations though maintain their rudimentary structures and permeable boundaries through self-regulatory resources. In this way, permeability enables organizations to leverage the differentiated capabilities of members within and outside of the space and facilitates knowledge exchange across boundaries and hierarchical levels that lead to innovative outcomes.",Bouncken R.; Aslam M.; Brem A.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2019 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Technology Management in the World of Intelligent Systems, Proceedings",2019-08-01,Universität Bayreuth;Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg,

Researchers' ambidexterity: The duality of exploratory orientation and exploitative orientation and its relationship with personality and the impact on research performance,"This study aims to explore the relationship among researchers' personality, researchers' ambidexterity, and their research performance. Ambidexterity describes someone's ability to use both hands with equal ease. And in the field of management, ambidexterity refers to the ability of organizations to simultaneously explore new capabilities and exploit existing competences. Although this concept has been established as an important antecedent of organizational innovation and performance, it is still unclear how organizational best strive for ambidexterity and even how this concept be best understood. Recently, researchers have started to argue that ambidexterity is not only essential at the organizational level, but also at the individual level. However, research on individual ambidexterity is still in its infancy. This paper is to explore the relationship between individuals' personality and individuals' ambidexterity. In particular, we identify individual who is a researcher from university or private enterprise. Data collected from 202 researchers in Japan. Then we examined the effect of researchers' personality-captured using FFM's big five factors-on both the researchers' exploratory orientation, exploitative orientation and ambidextrous orientation which is measured in three items each. And we operationalized our dependent variable, research performance in two different ways: the number of journal publications and amount of research expenses received in one year. We also included several control variables in our analyses like the English ability, years of experience as a researcher, years of research career and the number of members in the research team. We used SEM (structural equation modeling) for our analyses and observe the significant relationship between researchers' personality, researchers' ambidexterity and the impact on research performance.",Mao R.; Washida Y.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2019 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Technology Management in the World of Intelligent Systems, Proceedings",2019-08-01,Graduate School of Business Administration,

Job uncertainty after Ph.D.: A common concern for doctoral students of technical institutes of North East India,"A doctoral degree is the highest level of academic degree awarded by an academic institute. The doctoral program not only prepares the workforce to become faculties, administrators, and researchers in an academic institute, but also prepares the workforce for industry and business organizations. These workforces play a very important role in developing innovation that drives the economic growth of a nation. Attrition of doctoral students potentially wastes resources and time of both faculties and students which could otherwise be utilized elsewhere. High attrition reduces research output, which is an important factor while evaluating the status of an institution. Limited numbers of studies have been done on doctoral students’ satisfaction and attrition in India. The present study was an attempt to explore the experience of doctoral students and also to find the factors influencing satisfaction of doctoral students studying in technical institutes of North East India. An offline survey was conducted with 300 doctoral students studying Engineering, Science, Mathematics, and Humanities & Management. Data collected were analyzed using factor analysis and hierarchical multiple regression. Supervisor/Guide and Department Support, Reason for Doing Ph.D., Stress and Lack of Motivation, and Insecurity were found to contribute 41 % to doctoral students’ satisfaction with a p - value of 0.039.

External financing and enterprises' green technology innovation: A study based on the threshold model of firm size,"External financing is a key factor affecting the enterprises' green technology innovation. Based on the reference point theory, this paper has analyzed the relationship between external financing and green technology innovation with the fixed-effect threshold model of firm size. It is found out that firm size has significant threshold effects between green innovation and equity financing, debt financing as well as government subsidies. When firm size is below the threshold, the impacts of external financing towards green technology innovation are not significant, while there exists significant boost effect of external financing if firm size rise above threshold. Compared with private enterprises, the quantitative value of threshold is higher in state-owned enterprises, but the positive effects would be more intense if the firm size is within threshold. This paper can enrich the research of sci-tech finance, and can provide practical basis for manufacturing enterprises' innovative financing and green development.",Wang X.; Chu X.,Journal,Xitong Gongcheng Lilun yu Shijian/System Engineering Theory and Practice,2019-08-01,Shandong University of Finance and Economics,External financing ;  Firm size ;  Green technology innovation ;  Threshold model

Discussion on research thought of dry granulation of traditional Chinese medicine: research progress at home and abroad based on dry granulation technology,"Dry granulation technology is a great innovation in granulation technology,which saves many intermediate links and reduces many intermediate costs. It is closely related to the characteristics of materials,dry granulation equipment and process. Dry granulation technology is a systematic engineering science covering many technical fields. The process of dry granulation involves complex mathematical model mechanisms of temperature field,pressure field and velocity field,closely related to the characteristics of materials and drying equipment. However,due to the late start of research on dry granulation technology of traditional Chinese medicine,basic research is still weak. The research on dry granulation technology has achieved great results in the fields of food,chemical industry,agriculture and forestry,showing great reference significance. The advantage of dry granulation of traditional Chinese medicine is that it can be directly granulated by adding an appropriate amount of auxiliary materials in the extract powder of traditional Chinese medicine,without the need of wetting,mixing,drying and other processes. The process is simple and can effectively guarantee the quality of traditional Chinese medicine. The granules obtained by the dry granulation technique are important intermediates for preparing the solid preparations of traditional Chinese medicines,which would directly affect the subsequent molding process and the quality of the preparation products. Therefore,based on the characteristics of dry granulation method in traditional Chinese medicine and by referring to the advanced research results of dry granulation technology in other fields,we would discuss the research ideas of dry granulation in traditional Chinese medicine in terms of the mechanism of dry granulation equipment,technology,on-line detection technology and mathematical model of dry granulation process,hoping to provide reference for the research of dry granulation method in traditional Chinese medicine.",Kuang W.; Wu Z.; Wan N.; Li Y.; Wang X.; Kang C.; Liu Z.; Yang M.,Journal,Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica,2019-08-01,Jiangxi University of Chinese Medicine;Ltd.

A call for preventing suicide by hanging from ceiling fans: An interdisciplinary research agenda,"Hanging is a common method of suicide in several countries. Even as global suicide rates decrease, there is no evidence of suicides by hanging declining. There is limited research by type of hanging, and only a few papers present suicide by hanging from ceiling fans. Our paper proposes a research agenda that will: specify the size of the problem of hanging by ceiling fan (Stage 1: Surveillance), use standard engineering product development processes to modify ceiling fans for reducing their lethal capacity (Stage 2: Design Testing and Redevelopment), and examine the resulting beta-and release-build fans for safety and potential to reduce suicide in community samples (Stage 3: Evaluation).",Kariippanon K.; Wilson C.; McCarthy T.; Kõlves K.,Journal,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2019-08-01,Griffith Health;University of Wollongong,Ceiling fan ;  Engineering innovation ;  Hanging ;  Means restriction ;  Suicide
Enabling biodegradable functional biomaterials for the management of neurological disorders,"An increasing number of patients are being diagnosed with neurological diseases, but are rarely cured because of the lack of curative therapeutic approaches. This situation creates an urgent clinical need to develop effective diagnosis and treatment strategies for repair and regeneration of injured or diseased neural tissues. In this regard, biodegradable functional biomaterials provide promising solutions to meet this demand owing to their unique responsiveness to external stimulation fields, which enable neuro-imaging, neuro-sensing, specific targeting, hyperthermia treatment, controlled drug delivery, and nerve regeneration. This review discusses recent progress in the research and development of biodegradable functional biomaterials including electroactive biomaterials, magnetic materials and photoactive biomaterials for the management of neurological disorders with emphasis on their applications in bioimaging (photoacoustic imaging, MRI and fluorescence imaging), biosensing (electrochemical sensing, magnetic sensing and opical sensing), and therapy strategies (drug delivery, hyperthermia treatment, and tissue engineering). It is expected that this review will provide an insightful discussion on the roles of biodegradable functional biomaterials in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological diseases, and lead to innovations for the design and development of the next generation biodegradable functional biomaterials.",Shan D.; Ma C.; Yang J.,Journal,Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews,2019-08-01,Penn State College of Engineering,Bioimaging ;  Biosensing ;  Degradation ;  Functional biomaterials ;  Neurological disorders
Lower-Limb Prostheses and Exoskeletons With Energy Regeneration: Mechatronic Design and Optimization Review,"Lower-limb biomechatronic devices (i.e., prostheses and exoskeletons) depend upon onboard batteries to power wearable sensors, actuators, and microprocessors, therein inherently limiting their operating durations. Regenerative braking, also termed electrical energy regeneration, represents a promising solution to the aforementioned shortcomings. Regenerative braking converts the otherwise dissipated mechanical energy during locomotion into electrical energy for recharging the onboard batteries, while simultaneously providing negative mechanical work for controlled system deceleration. This paper reviewed the electromechanical design and optimization of lower-limb biomechatronic devices with electrical energy regeneration. The technical review starts by examining human walking biomechanics (i.e., mechanical work, power, and torque about the hip, knee, and ankle joints) and proposes general design principles for regenerative braking prostheses and exoskeletons. Analogous to electric and hybrid electric vehicle powertrains, there are numerous mechatronic design components that could be optimized to maximize electrical energy regeneration, including the mechanical power transmission, electromagnetic machine, electrical drive, device mass and moment of inertia, and energy storage devices. Design optimization of these system components is individually discussed while referencing the latest advancements in robotics and automotive engineering. The technical review demonstrated that existing systems (1) are limited to level-ground walking applications and (2) have maximum energy regeneration efficiencies between 30% and 37%. Accordingly, potential future directions for research and innovation include (1) regenerative braking during dynamic movements like sitting down and slope and staircase descent and (2) utilizing high-torque-density electromagnetic machines and low-impedance mechanical power transmissions to maximize energy regeneration efficiencies.",Laschowski B.; McPhee J.; Andrysek J.,Journal,Journal of Mechanisms and Robotics,2019-08-01,"Bloorview Research Institute;University of Toronto, Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering;University of Waterloo",actuators and transmissions ;  medical robotics ;  multibody dynamics and exoskeletons ;  prosthetics ;  wearable robots
The fit between firms’ open innovation and business model for new product development speed: A contingent perspective,"Recent studies suggest that the effectiveness of open innovation (OI) can significantly differ among firms. One possible reason is the different ways of implementing OI strategies. Another is the ignorance of the explicit role of business model (BM). In this study, we integrate the two plausible explanations by exploring the impact of the interplay between different OI implementations and BM on firms’ new product development (NPD) speed. Empirical results from a survey of 265 Chinese firms show that both OI breadth and OI depth positively affect NPD speed. More importantly, we find that an efficient BM strengthens the positive effect of OI depth while it weakens the positive effect of OI breadth. We also find that a novel BM strengthens the positive effect of OI breadth while it weakens the positive effect of OI depth. This research contributes to OI literature by underscoring the importance of matching the BMs to the OI strategies to facilitate NPD.",Zhu X.; Xiao Z.; Dong M.; Gu J.,Journal,Technovation,2019-08-01,"City University of Hong Kong, College of Business;University of Science and Technology of China;Xi'an Jiaotong University;Hefei University of Technology",Breadth ;  Business model ;  Depth ;  New product development speed ;  Open innovation strategy
Willingness-to-pay for coastline protection in New South Wales: Beach preservation management and decision making,"Coastal erosion is a global and pervasive phenomenon that predicates a need for a strategic approach to the future management of coastal assets (both built and natural): should we invest in protective structures such as seawalls that aim to preserve specific coastal features, or allow natural coastline retreat to preserve sandy beaches and other coastal ecosystems? Determining the most suitable management approach in a specific context requires a better understanding of the full suite of economic values the population holds for coastal assets, including non-market values. In this study, we characterise New South Wales residents' willingness to pay to maintain sandy beaches (width and length) in the face of coastal erosion along the Australian state's nearly 2200 km coastline. The measurement instrument is a stated preference referendum task administered state-wide to a sample of 2014 respondents, with the payment mechanism defined as a purpose-specific incremental levy of a fixed amount over a set period of years. We use an innovative application of a Latent Class Binary Logit model to deal with “Yea-sayers” and “Nay-sayers”, as well as revealing the latent heterogeneity among sample members. We find that 65% of the population would be willing to pay some amount of levy, dependent on the policy setting. In most cases, there is no effect of degree of beach deterioration – characterised as loss of width and/or length of sandy beaches of between 5% and 100% - on respondents' willingness to pay for a management levy. This suggests that respondents who agreed to pay a management levy were motivated to preserve sandy beaches in their current state irrespective of the severity of sand loss likely to occur as a result of coastal erosion. Willingness to pay also varies according to beach type (amongst Iconic, Main, Bay and Surf beaches) – a finding that can assist with spatial prioritisation of coastal management. Not recognizing the presence of nay-sayers in the data or recognizing them but eliminating them from the estimation will result in biased WTP results and, consequently, biased policy propositions by coastal managers.",Ardeshiri A.; Swait J.; Heagney E.; Kovac M.,Journal,Ocean and Coastal Management,2019-08-01,Erasmus School of Health Policy & Management;New South Wales Department of Planning & Environment;UNSW Sydney;Southern Cross University,Beach erosion ;  Choice modelling ;  Coastal management ;  Levy ;  Protest voting ;  Referendum
"Scientific effects of Triple Helix interactions among research institutes, industries and universities","The Triple Helix (TH) interactions among innovation organizations have become increasingly important for national science and technology development. Yet, few studies in the extant literature have investigated their effects on the participants' scientific performance. This study fills in this research gap by exploring whether the scientific performance of research institutes is influenced by their TH interactions with industries or/and universities. More specifically, the dynamic patterns of bilateral and trilateral interactions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) as a typical example with industries or/and universities, as well as their effects on the CAS's scientific performance are revealed by means of the TH theoretical framework. The research result shows that their bilateral and trilateral interactions not only directly and significantly improved the CAS's scientific performance but also moderately enhanced the effects of research investments on that performance. It is confirmed as expected that the bilateral interactions between research institutes and universities exhibit a more positive and significant effect on scientific performance in both direct and indirect ways compared with the bilateral interactions between research institutes and industries. In summary, this study extends the analytical scope of TH empirical studies by implementing an exploring research on the TH effects from the perspective of academic institutes.",Zhang Y.; Chen K.; Fu X.,Journal,Technovation,2019-08-01,Institutes of Science and Development;Oxford Social Sciences Division;Guangdong Ocean University;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences,Chinese academy of sciences ;  Industry–university–research institute relations ;  Scientific performance ;  Triple helix interactions
Scaling urban sustainability experiments: Contextualization as an innovation,"Research shows urban sustainability experiments are critical for sustainability transition in cities and beyond, especially when they are multiplied in other contexts and upscaled. Even with a growing body of literature on sustainability experiments, little is known on how these experiments travel to and are contextualized in other contexts. Here we attempt to fill this gap, taking the adoption and proliferation of Energy Performance Contracting (EPC)in Shanghai as a case study. First, based on the system innovation literature, we identify the critical components that characterize the innovative practices. We then examine the contextualization process of EPC in Shanghai using this characterization. Finally, we identify and compare some innovative elements that emerged during the contextualization with those in the original contexts from which Shanghai learned. We argue that post experiment adoption and contextualization requires mobilization and realignments of actors, resources, and institutional arrangements within the process of learning, which involves much more than simple duplication and often with distinctive outcomes, thus in many ways is an innovation in itself. Innovation in post experiment contextualization is supported by various “horizontal linkages” with the original experiment, which include information/knowledge transfer and learning via actor interactions across experiments, but the focus of learning shifts from external (i.e. from the original context)to internal (i.e. within the new context)during the contextualization process. These findings contribute to an in-depth understanding of how innovation can transfer across cases, which is a significant gap in current system innovation literature, and may inform practice in terms of how to facilitate the scaling of experiments to achieve sustainability transitions.",Peng Y.; Wei Y.; Bai X.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2019-08-01,The Fenner School of Environment & Society;Shanghai Pacific Energy Center,Contextualization ;  Endogenous innovation ;  Horizontal linkage ;  Realignment processes ;  Sustainability transition ;  Urban sustainability experiment
The innovation profile of nanotechnology team projects of face-to-face and online learners,"Innovation is an important practice required for 21st century engineers. Courses in emerging engineering fields encourage students to work on projects in small teams. Research has demonstrated several factors under which teamwork conducted face-to-face settings might enhance student innovation. It is, however, still unclear whether a similar effect is evident among teams of engineering students working in online environments. This study aims to characterize and examine the innovation of nanotechnology team projects by comparing three research groups: face-to-face university students, online university students, and online world learners. Applying a mixed-methods approach, the study included interviews with nanotechnology experts and an analysis of students' team projects. Content analysis identified four categories of team project innovation: Product necessity, STEM interdisciplinary, Market readiness, and Innovation type. The findings indicated that compared to the online learners, the face-to-face university students generated projects with a higher innovation profile.",Barak M.; Usher M.,Journal,Computers and Education,2019-08-01,Technion - Israel Institute of Technology,Engineering education ;  Innovation ;  Online learning ;  Team project
Using Studio Culture to Foster Epistemic Change in an Engineering Senior Design Course,"Contribution: This paper furthers understanding of how to use studio culture to develop instruction that supports learners' epistemic development in the context of an engineering senior design course, with a focus on student development of epistemic frames. Background: Current capstone engineering design courses do not integrate the educational theories and practice of cognitive apprenticeship combined with studio culture. Combined, these can be useful constructs for developing instruction that encourages creativity and innovation in a situated, student-centered, and activity-focused environment. Prior research and evidence-based instructional methods from other non-engineering contexts were used to create an instructional environment that engenders epistemic change. Research Questions: How do instructional design methods based on studio culture impact the cognitive and epistemic development of engineering students in a Senior Design course? Methods: This exploratory case study examines the effects of instructional design methods based on studio culture to change an Engineering Senior Design course from lecture-based to activity-based instruction in a collaborative environment. The case study emerges from a design-based research intervention, and uses mixed methods data collection from multiple sources, including video interviews, classroom footage, and written debrief reflections. Data analysis applied an integrated thematic approach. Implications were developed through an emergent coding process.

How the innovation-competition link is shaped by technology distance in a high-barrier catch-up economy,"The paper studies the effects of competition on innovation in various technology groups of mature Russian manufacturing firms. The purpose of the research is to establish whether more intense competition is good or bad for innovation, and to learn how the response to competition varies between technology leaders, followers and laggards. The study uses the 2014 survey data, which includes 1920 manufacturing firms from 19 sectors and size groups between 10 and 10,000 employees. The finding is that commitment to product innovation increases with competition at a modest level of competitive pressure, especially if foreign entry and import are considered. However, this result is mostly driven by technologically weak plants, which innovate less than leaders and followers at a low level of competition, but are encouraged to innovate more by a modest increase of competitive pressure, when theoretically predicted optimal behavior would be to refrain from innovation. When competition is strong, plants in all technology groups give up the innovation race. Competition is less influential in explaining process (as opposed to product) innovation, and the findings demonstrate a clear inverted U-shaped link: laggards and leaders are more likely to upgrade process technologies when weak competition increases slightly, and are less likely to do so when strong competition becomes stronger.",Bessonova E.; Gonchar K.,Journal,Technovation,2019-08-01,HSE University;Bank of Russia,Competitive pressure ;  Distance to the technology frontier ;  Manufacturing industry ;  Product and process innovation
Strategic alignment of technology: Organising for technology upgrading in emerging economy firms,"Technology upgrading plays a crucial role in the catching-up process of emerging economy firms (EEFs) that aim to develop technological capabilities and move from imitation to innovation. The literature on emerging economies has mainly focused on how EEFs overcome the lack of technological knowledge at initial stages of catching-up while neglecting organisational issues that arise at later stages. The purpose of this study was to explore organisational activities performed by EEFs that are innovating at advanced stages of catching-up. Two Brazilian firms, namely Petrobras and WEG, were selected to be studied and to provide evidence for the research. The results indicate that both firms have systematically monitored their environments to look for windows of opportunity and have consistently invested in learning mechanisms to overcome shortcomings in knowledge. Furthermore, an activity for aligning strategy and technology was found to be key for optimising the technology upgrading process and for maximising its results.",Bernat S.; Karabag S.,Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2019-08-01,Linköpings Universitet,Catching-up ;  Emerging economy firms ;  Learning mechanisms ;  Monitoring activities ;  Strategic alignment of technology ;  Technology upgrading

Gender equity: how do the forensic sciences fare?,"Females are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) at all levels of society. Fewer females are completing STEM school subjects, graduating with STEM degrees, being employed as STEM professionals, and holding senior leadership and academic positions in STEM. However, unlike almost every other STEM discipline, the overall ratio of females is higher in many forensic science disciplines. For our sector, rather than having difficulty in attracting females, the bigger issue is how we retain and promote female talent. This complex issue is exacerbated by: gender pay gaps; family role expectations; lack of visible role models or mentors; discrimination and harassment; and bias during recruitment and promotion practices. We discuss barriers relevant for women in the forensic industry and offer potential solutions. These include flexible work arrangements, sponsorship programmes, and fostering and practising an inclusive workplace culture. Gender equity programmes and exemplar STEM organizations focused on a commitment to gender parity will be explored.

Development of Advanced Design Technology and Its Application in Agricultural Equipment,"The competitiveness of modern equipment enterprises and their products largely depends on whether they can provide products to meet the market demand at the fastest speed, that is, whether they have advanced design methods to support the efficient research and development process. Aiming at the problem in low integral level of agricultural machinery research and development in China, as well as various types and significant regional differences result in a variety of professional knowledge, structural forms, practical experience and so on, making it difficult for individual designers to fully grasp, unable to guarantee the quality of research and development, and severely restricting the industrial development and independent innovation ability, thus the development process of design methods was comprehensively reviewed, the characteristics of times at each stage and the generation rules of advanced design methods were analyzed, the advanced design methods and development direction suitable for agricultural equipment was discussed, and the realization of the strategic goals set for agricultural equipment in major national development plans such as ""Made in China 2025"" was supported. The research showed that the trend of intelligent design based on digital technology was obvious, which represented the development direction and the highest level of advanced design by combining the current technological level and social background, making full use of the advantages of 3D-CAD virtual reality and the development results of computer technology. Intelligent design was characterized by knowledge reuse, based on digital model resource, carried by product data management (PDM) and product lifecycle management (PLM) platform, and organized and connected upstream and downstream design-related research links such as scheme reasoning, digital mockup (DMU), computer aided engineering (CAE), computer aided process planning (CAPP) by the generalized computer aided design concept. In this way, intelligent design can implement the high integration of CAX, which was the practical application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of design. The development ideas of current advanced design were clarified, basic theory and system architecture for the establishment of equipment intelligent design system were provided, and it had significant theoretical value and practical guiding significance for fully integrating industry resources, highly sharing achievements and professional knowledge, greatly improving research and development efficiency and level, and significantly enhancing the core competitiveness of Chinese equipment enterprises and their products.",Liu H.; Wang D.; Guo L.; Liu W.; Zhang G.; Sun W.,Journal,Nongye Jixie Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society for Agricultural Machinery,2019-07-25,Northeast Agricultural University,Advanced design technology ;  Agricultural equipment ;  Digital design ;  Intelligent design ;  Knowledge engineering ;  Resource reuse

Does integration promote enterprise technology innovation? Evidence from the global value chain,"In the context of promoting the construction of the national innovation system with enterprises as the main body, research on factors that influence enterprise technology innovation (ETI) is of great practical significance. This paper considers the integration of product and information flow in enterprise Global Value Chain (GVC) and aims to test whether integration is meaningful for ETI by comparing the impact of GVC on ETI through three different paths using the Probit and Poisson models. Additionally, situations in different regions and industries are further analyzed. The results show that integration is meaningful overall but not for all regions or industries; enterprises should start from product and management innovation to improve ETI based on integration; GVC-embedded-enterprise in the eastern region and high-tech industry should focus more on their relationship with consumers, improve product innovation, further enhance enterprise innovation participation breadth.",Jiao J.; Wang C.; Tang Y.; Li J.,Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2019-07-10,Hefei University of Technology,Consumer connection ;  Enterprise technology innovation ;  Global value chain ;  Integration ;  Supplier connection
Experimental study of deformation characteristics of pebble cushion with furrow for immersed tunnel,"It is an innovation to use pebble cushion with furrow as the foundation of a large-scale immersed tunnel. In order to investigate the deformation characteristics of the pebble cushion subjected to engineering load under water, static load model tests are carried out in seven working conditions. The compression modulus of pebble cushion under various working conditions, the relationship between load and settlement are obtained. The effects of cushion thickness, ridge and furrow dimensions, preloading load and gradation on the mechanical properties of pebble cushion are analyzed. Unlike the gravel cushion, the settlement of pebble cushion initially changes nonlinearly with vertical load. With the increase of load, the settlement rate of the pebble cushion gradually decreases. The relationship between load and settlement tends to be linear after the cushion is compacted to a certain extent. The larger maximum size of the pebble results in a larger compression modulus of the cushion and a smaller settlement. The pre-compression leads to a significant reduction in the subsidence of the pebble cushion and an increase in compression modulus when compressed again. As the distance between the furrows increases and the compression modulus of pebble cushion decreases, the settlement increases. With increasing the thickness of the cushion, the settlement and compression modulus of the pebble cushion increase slightly. The research results can provide reference for the design of immersed tunnel cushion.",Li Z.; Feng X.; Sheng L.,Journal,Yantu Lixue/Rock and Soil Mechanics,2019-07-10,China Communications Construction Company Limited;R. and D.

Multi-cellular engineered living systems: Building a community around responsible research on emergence,"Ranging from miniaturized biological robots to organoids, multi-cellular engineered living systems (M-CELS) pose complex ethical and societal challenges. Some of these challenges, such as how to best distribute risks and benefits, are likely to arise in the development of any new technology. Other challenges arise specifically because of the particular characteristics of M-CELS. For example, as an engineered living system becomes increasingly complex, it may provoke societal debate about its moral considerability, perhaps necessitating protection from harm or recognition of positive moral and legal rights, particularly if derived from cells of human origin. The use of emergence-based principles in M-CELS development may also create unique challenges, making the technology difficult to fully control or predict in the laboratory as well as in applied medical or environmental settings. In response to these challenges, we argue that the M-CELS community has an obligation to systematically address the ethical and societal aspects of research and to seek input from and accountability to a broad range of stakeholders and publics. As a newly developing field, M-CELS has a significant opportunity to integrate ethically responsible norms and standards into its research and development practices from the start. With the aim of seizing this opportunity, we identify two general kinds of salient ethical issues arising from M-CELS research, and then present a set of commitments to and strategies for addressing these issues. If adopted, these commitments and strategies would help define M-CELS as not only an innovative field, but also as a model for responsible research and engineering.",Sample M.; Boulicault M.; Allen C.; Bashir R.; Hyun I.; Levis M.; Lowenthal C.; Mertz D.; Montserrat N.; Palmer M.; Saha K.; Zartman J.,Journal,Biofabrication,2019-07-10,"The Grainger College of Engineering;College of Engineering;UW-Madison College of Engineering;College of Engineering;Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology (BIST);Instituto de Bioingeniería de Cataluña;Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Bioingeniería, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina;Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats;University of Wisconsin-Madison;Massachusetts Institute of Technology;Stanford University;CASE School of Medicine;Université McGill",emergence ;  ethics ;  governance ;  moral considerability ;  responsible innovation ;  society
Acceleration of the NVT Flash Calculation for Multicomponent Mixtures Using Deep Neural Network Models,"Phase equilibrium calculation, also known as flash calculation, has been extensively applied in petroleum engineering, not only as a standalone application for a separation process but also as an integral component of compositional reservoir simulation. Previous research devoted numerous efforts to improve the accuracy of phase equilibrium calculations, which place more importance on safety than speed. However, the equation-of-state-based flash calculation consumes an enormous amount of computational time in compositional simulation and thus becomes a bottleneck to the broad application of compositional simulators. Therefore, it is of vital importance to accelerate flash calculation without much compromise in accuracy and reliability, turning it into an active research topic in the past two decades. With the rapid development of computational techniques, machine learning brings another wave of technology innovation. As a subfield of machine learning, the deep neural network becomes a promising computational technique due to its great capacity to deal with complicated nonlinear functions, and it thus attracts increasing attention from academia and industry. In this study, we establish a deep neural network model to approximate the iterative flash calculation at given moles, volume, and temperature, known as the NVT flash. A dynamic model designed for NVT flash problems is iteratively solved to generate data for training the neural network. In order to test the model's capacity to handle complex fluid mixtures, three real reservoir fluids are investigated, including one Bakken oil and two Eagle Ford oils. Compared to previous studies that follow the conventional flash framework in which stability testing precedes phase splitting calculation, we incorporate stability test and phase split calculation together and accomplish two steps by a single deep learning model. The trained model is able to identify the single vapor, single liquid, and vapor-liquid states under the subcritical region of the hydrocarbon mixtures. A number of examples are presented to show the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed deep neural network. It is found that the trained model makes predictions at most 244 times faster than the iterative NVT flash calculation for the given cases and meanwhile preserves high accuracy.",Li Y.; Zhang T.; Sun S.,Journal,Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research,2019-07-10,King Abdullah University of Science and Technology;China University of Geosciences,
User-centric work environments in modular healthcare facilities,"Purpose: The challenges arising from the reform of the social and healthcare sector call for efficient, effective and novel processes in both public and private health and medical care. Facilities need to be designed to suit the new processes and to offer usable workspaces at different levels of healthcare services. Along with traditional construction, modular facility innovations could be one solution to these pressures. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: This case study analyzed the different usability characteristics of the work environment in modular and non-modular healthcare facilities (HCFs). The qualitative research method was based on semi-structured interviews of employees and observations of the case buildings. Findings: According to the results, the usability characteristics were divided into four main categories: functionality, healthiness, safety/security and comfort. The main differences between the modular and non-modular facilities appeared to be room size, soundproofing, safety issues and the utilization of colors and artwork, which were all perceived as better realized in the non-modular facilities. The staff highlighted functionality as the most important characteristic in their work environment. They even considered functionality as a feature of a comfortable work environment. Originality/value: This paper presents new knowledge and a detailed description of the opinions and experiences of healthcare professionals concerning a user-centric, usable environment in the context of modular and non-modular HCFs.",Aalto L.; Sirola P.; Kalliomäki-Levanto T.; Lahtinen M.; Ruohomäki V.; Salonen H.; Reijula K.,Journal,"Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management",2019-07-10,Aalto University;Lääketieteellinen Tiedekunta;Työterveyslaitos,Architecture ;  Design ;  Design management
Research on Network Public opinion Analysis Platform Architecture Based on Big Data,"With the development of Internet technologies and applications, network public opinion has undergone tremendous changes in terms of data volume, complexity, and speed of production. Existing public opinion analysis techniques and monitoring systems are difficult to adapt to changes in this scenario, and must be innovative under the thinking of big data analysis. Therefore, this paper designs a network public opinion analysis platform through the use of big data technology, including information collection, information processing, information analysis, public opinion display and information security. And from the three aspects of government decision-making, hotspot tracking, and public opinion guidance, the application effect of the platform is proposed, and the innovation of thinking, mode and technology of network public opinion management is realized. It has important theoretical and practical value for network public opinion management.",Yuan F.; Yang J.; Zheng Q.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,2019-07-09,State Grid Information and Telecommunication Group,
A Review of the National Green Innovation System in Israel,"With the aggravation of resource and environment problems, countries around the world are paying more and more attention to design green innovation policy system for guiding the development of low-carbon economy. Especially after proposing the strategic conception of building an ""innovative country"" and a ""resource-saving and environment-friendly society"", China has witnessed a boom in green innovation research. However, China's green innovation system started late, while developed countries such as Israel have extensive experience in the research and development of green innovation system. This paper makes an in-depth analysis of Israel's green innovation system from the five aspects, i.e. energy conservation and environmental protection, public finance, education and talent introduction, green finance and technology. The experience of Israel can provide significant reference value for China to formulate and improve the green innovation system.",Wu T.; Li Y.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,2019-07-09,Southwest University,

The research results show that: culture and technology integration innovation system is composed of complex feedback mechanisms that interact with each other. Each feedback loop represents the realization path of cultural science and technology fusion innovation. In the implementation path, cooperation between industry, universities and research institutes, market demand forecasting accuracy, innovation there is a significant positive impact between the perfection of incentive mechanism, the perfection of cultural intermediary service system and the integration of cultural science and technology innovation.",Wang Z.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,2019-07-09,Maanshan Teacher's College,
Blending Polymer Labile Elements at Differing Scales to Affect Degradation Profiles in Heart Valve Scaffolds,"After more than 22 years of research challenges and innovation, the heart valve tissue engineering paradigm still attracts attention as an approach to overcome limitations which exist with clinically utilized mechanical or bioprosthetic heart valves. Despite encouraging results, delayed translation can be attributed to limited knowledge on the concurrent mechanisms of biomaterial degradation in vivo, host inflammatory response, cell recruitment, and de novo tissue elaboration. This study aimed to reduce this gap by evaluating three alternative levels at which lability could be incorporated into candidate polyurethane materials electroprocessed into a valve scaffold. Specifically, polyester and polycarbonate labile soft segment diols were reacted into thermoplastic elastomeric polyurethane ureas that formed scaffolds where (1) a single polyurethane containing both of the two diols in the polymer backbone was synthesized and processed, (2) two polyurethanes were physically blended, one with exclusively polycarbonate and one with exclusively polyester diols, followed by processing of the blend, and (3) the two polyurethane types were concurrently processed to form individual fiber populations in a valve scaffold. The resulting valve scaffolds were characterized in terms of their mechanics before and after exposure to varying periods of pulsatile flow in an enzymatic (lipase) buffer solution. The results showed that valve scaffolds made from the first type of polymer and processing combination experienced more extensive degradation. This approach, although demonstrated with polyurethane scaffolds, can generally be translated to investigate biomaterial approaches where labile elements are introduced at different structural levels to alter degradation properties while largely preserving the overall chemical composition and initial mechanical behavior.",D'Amore A.; Luketich S.; Hoff R.; Ye S.; Wagner W.,Journal,Biomacromolecules,2019-07-08,Swanson School of Engineering;McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine;Fondazione Ri.MED,
Sustainable development as a driver for educational innovation in engineering school: the case of UniLaSalle,"The potential relationships between innovation and sustainability processes, in engineering education, is neither obvious nor simple, especially when innovation, generally speaking, is promoted regardless of sustainability. We used UniLaSalle (In January 2016, the ‘Institut Polytechnique LaSalle Beauvais’, a French engineering school, merged with another higher education engineering school (ESITPA, Rouen). Both campuses (Beauvais and Rouen) have a common name: UniLaSalle (www.unilasalle.fr). As the interview began during 2015, this article only describes the situation of the Beauvais campus.) as a ‘living Lab’ to identify and analyse the reasons for the integration of innovation and Sustainable Development (SD) in training programmes. The aim is to explore, in a perception and reflective approach, how SD can be understood as a driver for specific innovation attitudes in higher education engineering school. This paper adopts an empirical approach based on a qualitative study, using NVivo 9 software to analyse non-numerical data. Our research suggests that SD can be a structural driver for innovation if it is integrated in a transdisciplinarity approach and not just as a discipline per se.",Fourati-Jamoussi F.; Dubois M.; Agnès M.; Leroux V.; Sauvée L.,Journal,European Journal of Engineering Education,2019-07-04,UniLaSalle,engineering school ;  ethics ;  innovation in higher education ;  Sustainable development ;  transdisciplinarity
"How education background affects design outcome: teaching product development to mechanical engineers, industrial designers and managers","Product design and development (PDD) is a current topic of academic and industrial research. Emphasis on innovation and entrepreneurship, as well as design thinking and creativity has been recently pulled together into the teaching and research on PDD. This paper looks into a multidisciplinary setting made up of three similar but independent PDD masters courses taught at three higher education institutions, having the same assessment, syllabus, assignments and outcomes. As expected, students’ projects foci are different. The outcomes of this experience were confronted with an ex-post literature review, which generated thorough guidelines that supported an innovative proposal for PDD education, to be implemented into an interdisciplinary Summer School. Significant generalisable contributions for educating modern engineers, designers and business entrepreneurs are expected, instead of just teaching methods of engineering, design and entrepreneurship at the case universities.

"Lean, automation and modularization in construction","The architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry lags behind the manufacturing industry, both in terms of innovation and productivity, mainly due to its heterogeneous, fragmented nature and the uniqueness of its projects. This paper analyzes three effective processes and technologies which are carrying out great benefits to the construction industry: lean construction, automation, and modularization (LAM). The research consists of a systematic literature review and assesses previously published work related to the three combined topics LAM in construction with two main goals: (1) identify the relevance of the three topics combined for both the AEC industry and the academy, and (2) identify in the papers investigated the main themes related to the combination of LAM in construction. Findings reveal only 31 publications meeting the criteria within the two sources investigated. The most frequent areas of LAM identified in the papers were lean production management, optimization algorithm and prefabrication, respectively related to lean construction, automation in construction and modular construction. The results reveal a need to better investigate the interactions of LAM in construction as a way to promote the continuous improvement of the AEC industry.",Brissi S.; Debs L.,Conference Proceeding,"27th Annual Conference of the International Group for Lean Construction, IGLC 2019",2019-07-03,Purdue Polytechnic Institute,Automation ;  Continuous improvement ;  Lean construction ;  Modularization ;  Off-site construction

Transforming academia: The role of education,"Scientific research is usually presented as the driver that provides progress and meaning to the academic ecosystem. Higher education on the other hand, is typically imagined as something that naturally follows scientific research. In the academic ecosystem, education often retains a more marginalized position than scientific research and in many of the predominant accounts of the academic ecosystem it is even neglected. As a result, higher education and teaching tends to be treated as duty work that retracts resources away from research. In response to such accounts the present article proposes an alternative perspective in which higher education can assume a proactive role that affects institutions’ research. The article presents a case that demonstrates how social scientists at the Technical University of Denmark, in response to new demands for autonomous economy within Danish universities, invented the controversial, yet successful, ‘Design and Innovation’ engineering program. Design and Innovation’s controversial curricular composition brought together: creativity, social awareness, and product innovation and heralded the salvation for the declining status of engineering in Danish higher education. The article contributes to contemporary discussions on transformations within the university system by illustrating educational development as a transformative practice whereby the value and purpose of scientific disciplines get rearticulated in conversation with contemporary understandings of social needs.",Juhl J.; Buch A.,Journal,Educational Philosophy and Theory,2019-07-03,Aalborg University,co-production ;  engineering education ;  Higher education ;  innovation ;  reform ;  sociotechnical imaginaries
Evaluating instructors’ classification of programming exercises using the revised Bloom’s taxonomy,"It is a well-known fact that different instructors understand Bloom’s taxonomy differently, thus they classify given test exercises into different levels of the taxonomy. The article reports on the impact of training instructors on the use of the taxonomy for programming courses with two innovations: encouraging instructors to classify each exercise into several cognitive processes necessary to solve it, and providing them with a wide range of examples of classified programming exercises. We evaluated the impact of these innovations in two training sessions. In the first session, the revised Bloom’s taxonomy was introduced to the participants, and in the second session, the innovations were presented. In both sessions, participants were asked to classify ten exercises. The results show that classification into several cognitive processes was natural to instructors. However, other results were mixed. On the one hand, accuracy was increased, and confidence was increased for experienced participants. On the other hand, variation was increased, and confidence was decreased for non-experienced participants. Results show that our approach assists instructors in classifying exercises, but higher increases of expert instructors suggest that longer training is necessary for non-expert instructors.",Masapanta-Carrión S.; Velázquez-Iturbide J.,Conference Proceeding,"Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, ITiCSE",2019-07-02,Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador;Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,Bloom’s taxonomy ;  Computing science education ;  Instructors’ training

Toward developing a cloud computing model curriculum,"Cloud Computing is a rapidly evolving field that is triggering a wave of innovations in various domains such as machine learning and artificial intelligence. Cloud skills are becoming essential for any technology-related profession. Furthermore, the accelerated adoption of cloud technologies by industry is increasing the demand for cloud-trained professionals. Thus, higher education institutions are offering training opportunities and programs in cloud computing, however, the lack of well-rounded and high-quality curricular materials continues to be a challenge for educators. A 2018 Working Group (WG) created a report that –among other artifacts– described fourteen Knowledge Areas (KAs), with numerous Learning Objectives (LOs) for each KA, to teach cloud concepts. Expanding on that work, this WG will focus on providing a collection of resources that would eventually constitute a model cloud curriculum. By relying on two particular surveys: one that looks at the existing curricular offerings, and another one that maps knowledge areas to job titles in cloud computing, we plan to provide a dynamic and configurable curricular exemplars repository for the cloud community-at-large, following the popularity of hands-on, project-based learning methodologies as our primary focus.",Erdil D.; White L.; Foster D.; Adams J.; Cruz A.; Hainey B.; Hyman H.; Lewis G.; Nazir S.; Van Nguyen M.; Sakr M.; Stott L.,Conference Proceeding,"Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, ITiCSE",2019-07-02,Saint Leo University;School of Computer Science;Muma College of Business;Falmouth University;University of Lincoln;Microsoft Corporation;Sacred Heart University Fairfield;Instituto Politécnico Nacional;Glasgow Caledonian University;Google LLC,Cloud computing ;  Computer science ;  Curriculum development ;  Education ;  Project-based learning
Assessing Large-Scale ERP Implementation Success with a Balanced Scorecard,"This study examines large-scale enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementation success factors by looking at their impact on the balanced scorecard (BSC) indicators. Survey research was applied to collect data from large private and public companies (n=275) that have already implemented large-scale ERP (e.g. SAP, ORACLE). ERP Success factors consist of top management support, project management competence, business process engineering, user involvement, knowledge sharing, organization readiness, ERP system quality, and communication with understanding. BSC elements include the four common dimensions of BSC research, organization learning and innovation, internal process improvement, employee satisfaction, and financial benefit to the organization. Results indicated that business process re-engineering has a significant impact on all four BSC dimensions. Other ERP success factors had an impact on some of the BSC factors. However, understanding, user involvement, and organization readiness did not show a significant impact on any of the BSC factors. Top management support showed a negative impact on organization learning and support, contrary to expectations. This paper provides a better understanding of ERP implementation success factors for large-scale ERP, assessing their impacts on the four components of the BSC. The general usefulness of BSC application to ERP is supported, but some inconsistency suggests that there is no one-size-fits-all. Rather, such applications will need to adapt to their context.",Rotchanakitumnuai S.; Speece M.; Swierczek F.,Journal,Thammasat Review,2019-07-01,Thammasat University,Balanced Scorecard ;  Enterprise Resource Planning ;  Success factors ;  Thailand
Perception and emergence of a science shop in the Hauts-de-France region,"Civil society is being faced nowadays with unprecedented and global problems expressed for example by the seven societal challenges of the European research framework program. Sciences are called upon to clarify and find sustainable solutions. Yet they remain helpless in the face of the highly transverse nature of the issues. The latter concern society as a whole, including non-profit civil society organizations, who are experimenting new solutions and for whom access to research facilities is a necessity. Developing interfaces is therefore crucial. Science Shops are entities that carry out scientific research, usually free of charge, on behalf of citizens and local civil society. The term science is used in its broadest sense, including the social and human sciences, as well as natural, physical and engineering sciences. How Science Shops are structured is dependent on the local context. We describe here the creation process of our Science Shop carried out during an 18-month prefiguration study. We conducted a sociological survey followed by a participatory process where researchers and civil society organizations worked together in order to co-create the Science Shop of the Hauts-de-France region.

A study on the Factors Affecting Continuous Usage Intention of Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) Software,"Manufacturing industry is considered to be one of the industrial sectors expected to take the biggest influence while leading the recent changes under the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The product development sector, which is the core to secure the competitiveness of the manufacturing industry, has already advanced considerably to the level of advancement and optimization of highly conflicting subjects such as time, quality and cost. Meanwhile, the manufacturing industry is facing new challenges. Also, unlike ERP, SCM, and CRM, which are representative enterprise solutions for business activities of manufacturing enterprises, the engineering domain represented through product development is a realistic restriction which cannot be sufficiently researched because of the features of engineering expertise, closeness, confidentiality. At this point which we are facing unexperienced challenges, to study on the factors affecting continuous usage intention of Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) software, which is one of the themes to address innovation to different level, covering the conflicting subjects of time, cost and quality is meaningful as basic data for predicting and preparing a direction of change afterward. For this purpose, empirical studies on the affecting factors of perceived value, information system, and brand on satisfaction and continuous use intention of CAE experts in manufacturing companies and government - funded research institutes has been initiated and conducted. The result of this study confirms that perceived economic and time value, information and service quality and brand trust affect continuous usage intention through satisfaction. Through this study, it is confirmed that experts using CAE software at work are fully aware of the economic and temporal benefits of CAE software. It is also confirmed that information quality and service quality that directly affect business results, have a significant relationship with satisfaction and there are still areas to improve for diffusion of CAE software through the rejection of system quality in terms of ease of use. Based on the results, this study proposes a practical implication of CAE software use and academic implication to apply the experience value theory to the new field and provide verification of existing researches under the circumstances of lack of empirical studies on CAE software.",Cho Y.; Kim D.; Phuong H.; Gim G.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 20th IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing, SNPD 2019",2019-07-01,Soongsil University,brand trust ;  CAE ;  continuous usage intention ;  information system factors ;  perceived value factors

Spillover effect and sustainable innovation of competing firms with channel leadership,"In each stage of the supply chain system, the sustainable green innovation plays a critical role. Moreover, there may exist substitution effect between products, and the spillover effect of learning characteristics generated by sustainable green technology investment will enable other related companies to obtain certain profits. Therefore, the spillover effect and substitution effect of sustainable green technology investment will change the pricing decision, demand decision and the profits of the two competing companies. Based on the spillover effect characteristics of sustainable green technology innovation on the two competing companies, we build mathematical models and analyze the models with numerical results. The research results are as follows: In a duopoly market, the Nash equilibrium profits of the two competing companies will decrease as the product's substitutability increases, and the Nash equilibrium profit of one company will change due to the change of the scale of the other's sustainable green technology innovation investment. Within a certain range, when the market has demand for green products, both competing companies have incentives to take corresponding investments and obtain profits, but there are also have risks. At the same time, a good sustainable green technology innovation investment market environment will increase corporate profits, but when it exceeds a certain threshold value, it will also reduce corporate profits. Moreover, companies in the status of followers have inherent disadvantages, so when the market environment and their own conditions are sufficient, they should make decisions in a timely manner.",Du B.; Hu Z.; Liu R.; Li Z.,Conference Proceeding,"2019 16th International Conference on Service Systems and Service Management, ICSSSM 2019",2019-07-01,Ningbo University,Nash game ;  Spillover effect ;  Stackelberg game ;  Sustainable green innovation

A brief introduction to ecological problems and the research progress of soil remediation in the northern foot of qinling mountains,"Qinling Mountains is one of the key areas of ecological conservation in China. As an important part of the Qinling Mountains, the northern foot of the Qinling Mountains (Xi’an section) is related to the ecological environment and economic development quality of Xi’an City. The special location, over-exploitation of mineral resources, illegal construction of private villas, free discharge of domestic waste, have led to a series of soil pollution problems, with serious environmental damage in the northern foot of Qinling Mountains. In view of the ecological problems such as diverse pollution types and varying pollution levels in the northern foot of Qinling Mountains, it is necessary to use remote sensing monitoring to carry out in-depth investigation, with the aim to promote the restoration and evaluation of contaminated land and realize the rational utilization of land resources and further improvement of soil quality. According to different soil properties and pollution conditions, physicochemical, biological and new soil remediation techniques are used to establish effective remediation system in the aspects of pollution source and pollution degree, and to carry out long-term dynamic monitoring.

Entrepreneurial intent of engineering and business undergraduate students,"Background: In recent years, technological innovation and entrepreneurship have been emphasized in engineering education. There is a need to better understand which individual- and contextual-level factors are related to engineering students' entrepreneurial intentions. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study explores individual and contextual predictors of entrepreneurial intent among undergraduate women and men in engineering and business majors. Entrepreneurial intent is defined as the personal importance that students ascribe to starting a new business or organization. Design/Method: The participants included 518 engineering and 471 business undergraduates from 51 U.S. colleges and universities. We examined relationships first by discipline and then by gender in each discipline using regression models with interaction terms. Results: Innovation orientation and participation in entrepreneurship activities tied to intent more strongly for engineering students than for business students; in contrast, being at a research institution and selection of novel goals tied to intent more strongly for business students than for their engineering peers. Among engineering students only, being able to switch gears and apply alternative means for reaching one's goal in the face of setbacks was positively related with women's entrepreneurial intent but not with men's. Conclusions: Entrepreneurial intent is a function of individual-level characteristics and academic and social contexts, with some degree of discipline-specific effects. Diversifying the community of aspiring engineering entrepreneurs is a critical issue that merits attention by the engineering education community.",Gilmartin S.; Thompson M.; Morton E.; Jin Q.; Chen H.; Colby A.; Sheppard S.,Journal,Journal of Engineering Education,2019-07-01,Stanford Engineering;Stanford Graduate School of Education;Stanford University;Earnin,cross-field comparison ;  entrepreneurship ;  gender ;  program design ;  regression
Clinical implementation of the Humacyte human acellular vessel: Implications for military and civilian trauma care,"The incidence of wartime vascular injury has increased and is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity. While ligation remains an option, current resuscitation and damage control techniques have resulted in vascular repair being pursued in more than half of wartime injuries. Options for vascular reconstruction are currently limited to autologous vein or synthetic conduits, choices which have not changed in decades, both of which have problems. Autologous vein is preferable but requires time to harvest and may not be available. Synthetic grafts are poorly resistant to infection and associated with thrombotic complications. Recognizing this capability gap, the US Combat Casualty Care Research Program has partnered with academia and industry to support the development and clinical introduction of a bioengineered human acellular vessel. This human acellular vessel has the potential to be an off-the-shelf conduit that is resistant to infection and incorporates well into native tissues. This report reviews the rationale of this military-civilian partnership in medical innovation and provides an update on the clinical use and ongoing study of this new vascular technology.

Co-Imagining the Futures of Implementation Precision Medicine Using Scenario Analysis and Design Fiction,"Precision medicine has a long history dating to the early 20th century when inquiries into the biochemical basis of large person-to-person variations in susceptibility to human diseases and response to medicines had first begun. Yet, personalized medicine in the 21st century is far from being ""future-proof."" Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, and changing human values and preferences, call for anticipatory, rather than reactive, approaches to the governance of precision medicine futures. In this context, anticipatory governance is an innovative approach to understanding technology and innovation futures. Anticipatory governance and its corollary anticipatory ethics on emerging technologies require interdisciplinary collaboration and communication to cultivate shared language, imagination, and orientation toward plausible sociotechnical innovation trajectories. This study reports, for the first time in the literature to the best of our knowledge, an anticipatory governance experiment on ""implementation precision medicine (IPM)"" using scenario analysis and design fiction. Participants were undergraduate students and experts who collaboratively imagined the plausible futures of precision medicine. Given the long history of the precision medicine field, and recent calls for translating big data to real-life clinical applications, implementation was chosen as a key focus area of precision medicine futures. We report here several plausible future innovation scenarios of interest to precision medicine scientists and engineers and researchers in the fields of emerging technology governance, responsible innovation, and social studies of science. Of importance, we found that the playful quality of the design fiction methodology and the pedagogical orientation facilitated by undergraduate student involvement created an engaging creative safe space to build transdisciplinary dialog examining the social and anticipatory ethics dimensions of IPM. Demonstrating the possibilities of such cross-disciplinary dialog and differential expertise, this article is conceptualized and coauthored by all participants further attesting to the importance of co-designing and co-imagining innovation futures in IPM.",York E.; Conley S.; Henriksen A.; Caserta D.; Etka N.; Harrington N.; Jennings M.; Kodua S.; Pates R.; Sevison Z.; Terry E.; VanNostrand S.; Vargas K.,Journal,OMICS A Journal of Integrative Biology,2019-07-01,James Madison University,anticipatory ethics ;  anticipatory governance ;  design fiction ;  implementation precision medicine ;  scenario analysis ;  technology foresight
Waterless fluids in hydraulic fracturing – A review,"Unconventional resources such as shale gas have attracted increasing global attention with great potential to bridge the energy supply chain. Yet the technical challenges and ecological concerns arise in the attempts to increase resource recovery. Shale reservoirs feature a low permeability water-sensitivity, and geological complexity, which call for more effective stimulation techniques to both reduce water use and boost production. It is believed that technology innovation such as waterless fracturing is the key to effectively improving unconventional resources recovery, while addressing the issue in reducing water consumption and environmental footprints. This paper investigates the development of two major waterless fracturing fluids, foams and liquid N2/CO2, including the advantages and challenges faced with waterless fracturing, fracturing mechanisms, and fluid properties such as stability and rheology. Based on literature review, it is believed that foam has a great potential to be a promising fracturing fluid in improving productivity and long-term production with benefits such as fast cleanup, improved proppant transport, and minimal environmental footprint. Foam properties such as stability and rheology have been continuously improved with technological advances in the stabilizing agents. Foams stabilized by nanoparticles are reported to significantly improved foam stability and rheology under reservoir conditions over conventional surfactants. Other fracturing fluids such as liquid CO2/N2 and gas fracturing fluids are designed to clear formation damage near the wellbore or for scenarios where long fractures are not desired, and both are faced with various technical challenges. This review provides readers with the state-of-the-art research progress regarding the technological advances of waterless fracturing fluids and sheds light on future research areas that can benefit a greener and more effective shale gas development.",Fu C.; Liu N.,Journal,Journal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering,2019-07-01,College of Engineering,Foam ;  Life cycle assessment ;  Liquid CO /N 2 2 ;  Shale gas ;  Waterless fracturing
Relative space-based GIS data model to analyze the group dynamics of moving objects,"The relative motion of moving objects is an essential research topic in geographical information science (GIScience), which supports the innovation of geodatabases, spatial indexing, and geospatial services. This analysis is very popular in the domains of urban governance, transportation engineering, logistics and geospatial information services for individuals or industrials. Importantly, data models of moving objects are one of the most crucial approaches to support the analysis for dynamic relative motion between moving objects, even in the age of big data and cloud computing. Traditional geographic information systems (GIS) usually organize moving objects as point objects in absolute coordinated space. The derivation of relative motions among moving objects is not efficient because of the additional geo-computation of transformation between absolute space and relative space. Therefore, current GISs require an innovative approach to directly store, analyze and interpret the relative relationships of moving objects to support their efficient analysis. This paper proposes a relative space-based GIS data model of moving objects (RSMO) to construct, operate and analyze moving objects’ relationships and introduces two algorithms (relationship querying and relative relationship dynamic pattern matching) to derive and analyze the dynamic relationships of moving objects. Three scenarios (epidemic spreading, tracker finding, and motion-trend derivation of nearby crowds) are implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed model. The experimental results indicates the execution times of the proposed model are approximately 5–50% those of the absolute GIS method for the same function of these three scenarios. It's better computational performance of the proposed model when analyzing the relative relationships of moving objects than the absolute methods in a famous commercial GIS software based on this experimental results. The proposed approach fills the gap of traditional GIS and shows promise for relative space-based geo-computation, analysis and service.",Feng M.; Shaw S.; Fang Z.; Cheng H.,Journal,ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing,2019-07-01,"Collaborative Innovation Center of Geospatial Technology;Wuhan University;Wuhan University of Technology;The University of Tennessee, Knoxville",GIS data model ;  Human dynamics ;  Moving objects ;  Relative space ;  Spatiotemporal analysis
“From lab bench to store shelves:” A translational research & development framework for linking university science and engineering research to commercial outcomes,"Research conducted at the university can have considerable commercial potential. However, turning those discoveries, innovations, and inventions into commercially viable products can prove extremely difficult. Based on a systematic review and narrative synthesis of the literature on translational research: the different models, its practice, and the efforts to streamline it, the author proposes a novel translational research & development framework to better link university science and engineering research to commercial outcomes, i.e., to create a more seamless transition from research to business. The author identified the best practices in translational research (as encountered mostly in biomedical research), adapted them for use in more general science and engineering research contexts, and combined them with well-established best practices in project management, new product development, business development, science of team science, and intellectual property management. The result is a robust, structured framework that can help university investigators bring their ideas to market. The proposed framework is also relevant to university investigators who might not intend to turn their early-stage innovations into businesses, but rather advance the development of the innovations to the point where they become attractive for others (e.g., entrepreneurs, industry), to embrace the challenge of developing the innovations further for the market.",Bazan C.,Journal,Journal of Engineering and Technology Management - JET-M,2019-07-01,Memorial University of Newfoundland,Academic entrepreneurship ;  Commercialization ;  New product development ;  Technology transfer ;  Translational research & development

The effects of technology innovation and network presence on Otaku identity,"In Taiwan young people is profoundly influenced by Japanese ACG (animation, comics, and games) culture, which gather the subculture group with unique values named Otaku. People had a negative stereotype of Otaku in the past, however, Otaku people are in fact those who delve into technology products and good at using them. The aim of this study is to explore the impact of technology innovation on Otaku identity from internal (Otaku) and external (non-Otaku) perspectives. This study adopts three stages of the research process. First, based on the diffusion of innovations theory, a tentative Otaku identity model (OIM) including four constructs of technology innovation, subculture social system, subculture social identity, and social presence (network presence and physical presence) was proposed. Second, qualitative interviews with ten Otaku participants were conducted to understand Otaku's core thinking pattern, to confirm the tentative OIM, and to justify the establishment of follow-up surveys. Third, quantitative surveys of 122 Otaku and 207 non-Otaku were conducted to verify the OIM model by using SPSS-PROCESS. The results show that our proposed OIM is fit for this research and conclude that technology innovation and network presence can significantly change general people's Otaku identity.",Ho T.; Tsai H.; Lin P.,Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2019-07-01,National Sun Yat-Sen University,Network presence ;  Otaku ;  SPSS-PROCESS ;  Subculture ;  Technology innovation
New chemical engineering provision: Quality in diversity,"Recent growth in chemical engineering student numbers has driven an increase in the number of UK universities offering the subject. The implications of this growth are described, along with the different challenges facing new providers in the UK compared with established departments. The approaches taken by the various new entrants are reviewed, with reference to recruitment strategies, infrastructure, the use of external facilities, and the particular flavours of chemical engineering being offered by the new providers. Information about the differentiating features of the large number of chemical engineering degree courses now available is somewhat indistinct: this should be rectified in the interests both of prospective students and of employers. Dilemmas facing new providers include the need to address the fundamentals of the subject as well as moving into more novel research-led areas; enabling students to develop the competencies to sustain them for a whole career as well as meeting immediate employer needs; and providing sufficient industry understanding when academics may lack substantial industrial experience. The central importance of practical provision and of the design project, and the approaches taken by new providers to deliver these components, are reviewed, together with the role of software tools in chemical engineering education, and measures to facilitate industry input into courses. As long as it is not used prescriptively or to inhibit innovation, the accreditation process provides constructive guidance and leverage for universities developing new chemical engineering programmes.",Brown D.; Campbell G.; Belton D.; Cox P.; Garcia-Trinanes P.; Tizaoui C.,Journal,Education for Chemical Engineers,2019-07-01,University of Huddersfield;University of Greenwich;Aston University;University of Wolverhampton;Swansea University,Accreditation ;  Course content ;  Design projects ;  Industry engagement ;  Laboratory provision ;  Software tools ;  Student recruitment
Supply chain re-engineering using blockchain technology: A case of smart contract based tracking process,"The emergence of blockchain technology has created a number of potential innovations in handling business activities across various industries. However, few studies discuss the potential influence of blockchain technology from a business process re-engineering perspective. This study focuses on the feasibility and inceptive application of supply chain processes. We proposed a blockchain-based framework along with the use of an affiliated technology, i.e., smart contracts, to derive the feasible benefits of the supply chain process design. Through the illustrative design of an integrated process, we provide an achievable use case of the disintermediation of business processes via a conceptual, shared information ledger. This ledger not only facilitates the sharing of tracking information but also promotes a network for multilateral collaboration among supply chain members. The pursuit of transparency and accountability across supply chain processes can potentially influence decentralization and automation. A comparative analysis of the current and proposed frameworks is conducted to support the core reasoning of this study.

Linking social and economic responsibilities and financial performance: The assisting role of innovation for an oil engineering and development company,"Social and economic responsibilities of companies lead to positive and successful financial performance of companies, and they lead to improve the company ratings and evaluations among consumers. In addition, innovation in products and the process of management make it competitive, and they considerably contribute to the growth of the company's performance. Therefore, the present research aims to study the relationship between the social and economic responsibilities with the financial performance through relying on the facilitating role of innovation. To accomplish this, 278 data samples were collected from the staff working for an oil engineering and development company (in the period of December 2017 to March 2018) based on a Likert scale questionnaire. Then the results were analysed using structural equation models together with Amos24 and SPSS22 software. The results of this study showed that the impact of economic responsibility on innovation is only positive and significant and the social responsibility cannot affect innovation changes. Also, innovation is ineffective in the financial performance of the oil engineering and development company. Hence, it is essential to use effective polices related to the companies' economic responsibility necessary for obtaining better long-term innovations. Moreover, it is suggested that the managers provide insights for improving the role of social responsibility in achieving future benefits and higher financial performances.",Oskouei Z.,Journal,International Journal of Finance and Economics,2019-07-01,"Islamic Azad University, East Tehran Branch",Economic responsibility ;  financial performance ;  innovation ;  social innovation ;  social responsibility
"Product upgrading or not: R&D tax credit, consumer switch and information updating","Research and Development (R&D) investment is critically important for an innovation firm to maintain market value. In this paper, we examine whether the firm should adopt the product upgrading strategy. We build up a newsvendor model with Bayesian information updating. The firm produces and sells a normal product in the first period, and decides whether to make R&D investment to upgrade the product and switch to the line of upgraded one. The consumer may or may not switch from the normal product to the upgraded one in the second period based on the comparison of surplus. We find that it is beneficial to adopt the product upgrading strategy when the degree of upgraded product demand uncertainty is below a certain threshold. We identify the conditions, under which both the firm and consumer welfare would be better off, once the firm decides to sell the upgraded product. More managerial insights are discussed.",Shi X.; Shen B.,Journal,International Journal of Production Economics,2019-07-01,Donghua University;Nanjing University of Science and Technology,Behavioral operations management ;  Consumer switch ;  Consumer welfare ;  Information updating ;  R&D ;  Two-period
"Fish, finances, and feasibility: Concerns about tidal energy development in the United States","This article explores stakeholder views on tidal energy in the state of Washington. Through compiling and analyzing three qualitative datasets, we take a triangulated approach to better understand stakeholders’ positive and negative views, concerns, and needs regarding tidal energy and if and how these are represented through print and online news sources. We analyzed comments submitted during the permitting process for the Admiralty Inlet Pilot Tidal Project, comments included as part of a tidal energy mail survey sent to Washington residents, and media articles about tidal energy. We found four types of concern themes within negative views towards tidal energy: environmental, social, economic, and technical. Shared concerns between organized stakeholder groups and resident stakeholders about the project and tidal energy in general included concerns related to the harm to marine life, the loss of native fishing rights, expensiveness of development, increased electricity costs, and the engineering challenge of developing tidal energy. Concerns unique to stakeholder groups for the project included threats from scaling up, issues related to public safety and security, damage to cables, inability to stop the turbine, harm to terrestrial flora, and sediment disruption and contamination. Positive views were commonly associated with the need to address environmental issues, technological innovation and leadership, desire to have a diverse energy portfolio, and economic benefits.",Dreyer S.; Beaver E.; Polis H.; Jenkins L.,Journal,Energy Research and Social Science,2019-07-01,University of Washington;Arizona State University,Marine renewable energy ;  media analysis ;  Qualitative research ;  Stakeholder views ;  Tidal energy
Automated design and modeling for mass-customized housing. A web-based design space catalog for timber structures,"The research proposes a model for mass-customized housing in the emerging context of Industry 4.0 promoted by the European Union as a mean for technological and industrial innovation. With the aim to develop a cross-laminated timber (CLT) model for the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry, the study deepens the possibility of using generative models and evolutionary principles to inform the customization process in the early stage of design. By trying to bring the latest innovation in the field of computer science and information technology to customers who typically are not proficient with algorithmic design and computation, the research builds up an intuitive interface that allows customers to explore different design solutions. Related to the scale of a single-family house, this model is intended to be used as a decision support system for the design of residential and emergency homes in central Italy.",Bianconi F.; Filippucci M.; Buffi A.,Journal,Automation in Construction,2019-07-01,Università degli Studi di Perugia,Building Information Modeling (BIM) ;  Data driven design ;  Design automation ;  Energy optimization ;  Genetic Algorithms (GA) ;  Hyperdimensional data analysis ;  Mass-customization ;  Multi-objective optimization ;  Parametric design ;  Timber construction
Pressure engineering of photovoltaic perovskites,"As the driving force for technological innovations in the field of photovoltaic applications, metal halide perovskites have been extensively studied and significant research progress has been made in the last few years. Of particular interest is that with the addition of the pressure dimension, the development of the investigations has contributed significantly to the reliable detection of structure–property relationships. Furthermore, recent discoveries based on new perovskite materials and new characterizations have led to resurgence in studying not only the pressure-tailored physical properties but also the pressure-driven novel functionality, including the ambient performance after removing applied pressure. We will discuss the manipulation, modification, and improvement in photovoltaic perovskites by pressure engineering, which is crucial to achieve the desired characteristics for the next generation of material-by-design, as well as various applications.",Liu G.; Kong L.; Yang W.; Mao H.,Journal,Materials Today,2019-07-01,Center for High Pressure Science and Technology Advanced Research;Carnegie Institution of Washington,
"The prevalence of publicly stimulated innovations –A comparison of Finland and Sweden, 1970–2013","While the role played by the state in stimulating innovation in the private sector has been a prevalent interest in innovation research, studies analysing the impacts of public interventions have usually focused on individual policies, programs or projects. Public stimulation is hence often studied from a relatively restricted and temporarily confined perspective, leaving a macro-level and longer-term perspective unrecognized. This article provides further evidence on the matter by examining how many innovations in Finland and Sweden have been publicly stimulated through funding or research collaboration, over a period of more than four decades (1970–2013). Our main source is a new innovation database constructed following the Literature Based Innovation Output (LBIO) method, which gathers the most significant innovations of both countries for the study period, totalling approximately 4100 Swedish and 2600 Finnish innovations. Our results indicate that the public sector has played a very prominent role in stimulating private innovation in both countries, and with an increasing trend. This is especially true for Finland, where 35–55% of the innovations of the period have been stimulated by public funding and 25–65% by collaboration with public research. In Sweden, the share of publicly stimulated innovations has been somewhat lower and erratic, but has increased over time.",Torregrosa-Hetland S.; Pelkonen A.; Oksanen J.; Kander A.,Journal,Research Policy,2019-07-01,Teknologian Tutkimuskeskus VTT;Lunds Universitet;Prime Minister’s Office,Impact ;  Innovation ;  Innovation policy ;  Literature based innovation output (LBIO) method ;  Public policy
Genetic evolution vs. function approximation: Benchmarking algorithms for architectural design optimization,"This article presents benchmark results from seven simulation-based problems from structural, building energy, and daylight optimization. Growing applications of parametric design and performance simulations in architecture, engineering, and construction allow the harnessing of simulation-based, or black-box, optimization in the search for less resource- and/or energy consuming designs. In architectural design optimization (ADO) practice and research, the most commonly applied black-box algorithms are genetic algorithms or other metaheuristics, to the neglect of more current, global direct search or model-based, methods. Model-based methods construct a surrogate model (i.e., an approximation of a fitness landscape) that they refine during the optimization process. This benchmark compares metaheuristic, direct search, and model-based methods, and concludes that, for the given evaluation budget and problems, the model-based method (RBFOpt) is the most efficient and robust, while the tested genetic algorithms perform poorly. As such, this article challenges the popularity of genetic algorithms in ADO, as well as the practice of using them for one-to-one comparisons to justify algorithmic innovations.",Wortmann T.,Journal,Journal of Computational Design and Engineering,2019-07-01,Singapore University of Technology and Design,Architectural design optimization ;  Benchmarking ;  Black-box optimization ;  Genetic algorithms ;  Model-based methods
Matching decentralized energy production and local consumption: A review of renewable energy systems with conversion and storage technologies,"The increasing share of decentralized intermittent renewable energy reinforces the necessity of balancing local production and consumption. Decentralized energy systems, powered by renewable energy technologies and incorporating storage and conversion technologies, are promising options to cope with this challenge. Many studies have evaluated their potential contributions, but an overview of the status-quo in both academia and practice is missing. The extant literature lacks a comprehensive review of the scientific knowledge on decentralized energy systems, partially attributed to the lack of common terminology. Additionally, it remains unclear what kind of systems are already implemented today worldwide as they have not yet been thoroughly analyzed and described. However, pilot projects provide valuable insights into future applications and operational aspects. To fill these gaps, an extensive review of the current state of literature and practice is conducted. To do so, 64 publications and 56 projects were analyzed and an overview is provided using four criteria: terminology, scope/motivation, application, and technical configuration. These criteria facilitate the understanding of decentralized energy systems needed to spur their development and diffusion. Further advancements of research and practice are discussed. For example, technological learning hinges on a common terminology and on an identification of optimal technical configurations per application. There are both avenues for future research.

Knowledge and degree of training of primary education teachers in relation to ICT taught to students with disabilities,"The integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) into the inclusive classroom requires competent teaching staff from both the technological and pedagogical points of view. Within this context, and with the aim of looking at one of these theoretical premises, this study aimed to identify the degree of training and technological knowledge of primary school teachers in Spain with respect to the use of ICT with individuals with disabilities (functional diversity). A descriptive ex post-facto research method was used, where the sample comprised 777 teachers. An ad-hoc questionnaire was used as the data-collection instrument. The results revealed the low skill levels of the teachers with respect to the use of ICT with students with disabilities, where the level of training of the teaching staff was determined by personal (gender, age), professional (teaching experience) or educational (qualifications) variables. The findings of this study point to the need for teacher training that instructs teachers on the use of ICT in order to favour the learning and educational innovation of students with disabilities.",Fernández-Batanero J.; Cabero J.; López E.,Journal,British Journal of Educational Technology,2019-07-01,"Universidad de Sevilla;Universidad Pablo de Olavide, de Sevilla",
Flipped classroom technology in engineering education: Criteria of educational innovation,"Introduction. The article focuses on a significant problem of developing education according to current innovative trends and challenges. The purpose of the research is to identify the criteria of educational innovation. Materials and Methods. The research methodology is based on the socio-cultural approach, which considers education as a leading, predictive institution of social development, due to the consistency of the definition of “innovation” with its semantic highlights characteristic for conceptual national documents. Results. In the context of global socio-cultural trends, the most general definition of “innovation” is explicated - as something new and effective in the context of preserving and developing anthropological potential. For the field of education, it is proposed to focus on a narrower understanding of innovation - in accordance with the social and technological tasks which appear in the conceptual national documents of the Russian Federation. Two more criteria are efficiency and essential novelty of educational innovation. To illustrate the theoretical findings based on the authors' “non-traditional” approach to learning (in the Western version the closest is the 'Flipped Classroom' technology) the characteristic features of innovative learning are revealed. Conclusions. The criteria of educational innovation in the context of Russian innovation-oriented socio-cultural reality are identified. They include methodological novelty, educational efficiency and compliance with the tasks of technological “breakthrough” of Russian Society. In terms of global trends in understanding the category of 'innovation' in Russian educational research investigations it is recommended to use such terms as “novelty” and “creation”.",Kochetkov M.; Noskov M.,Journal,Science for Education Today,2019-06-30,Siberian Federal University;Moscow Pedagogical State University,Blended learning ;  Creativity ;  Flipped classroom ;  Innovation ;  Inverted classroom ;  Non-traditional approach to learning ;  Practical training session
Stathmin regulates the proliferation and odontoblastic/osteogenic differentiation of human dental pulp stem cells through Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway,"Odontoblastic/osteogenic differentiation of human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs)is a key factor in tooth and pulp regeneration, but its mechanism still remains unknown. The purpose of this research is to look into the mechanism by which Stathmin affects the proliferation and odontoblastic/osteogenic differentiation of hDPSCs, and whether the Wnt/β- catenin is related to this regulation. First, the Stathmin expression was inhibited by lentiviral vector, after that the transcriptome sequencing technology was used to screen the differentially expressed genes, then we found Wnt5a which related to the regulation of Wnt/β-catenin was regulated. Comparing with hDPSC in the control group, the shRNA-Stathmin group inhibited proliferation and odontoblastic/osteogenic differentiation. The result of molecular analysis indicated that the Wnt/β-catenin was inhibited when Stathmin was silenced. After that, the shRNA-Stathmin group were added with LiCl (activator of Wnt/β-catenin), and the Wnt/β-catenin was significantly activated in β-catenin. After activation of the Wnt/β-catenin, the proliferation of hDPSCs was significantly increased and the expression of genes related to odontoblastic/osteogenic differentiation was also significantly increased. Taken together, these findings reveal for the first time that the Stathmin-Wnt/β-catenin plays a positive regulatory role in hDPSC proliferation and odontoblastic/osteogenic differentiation. Significance: Transcriptome sequencing revealed that Stathmin interacts with Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway-related proteins such as Wnt5a. At the same time, experiments have confirmed that Stathmin protein can affect the proliferation and odontogenetic differentiation of hDPSCs.The innovation of this paper is to link the Stathmin and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways for the first time, to explore the interaction of Stathmin and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways and the mechanism of this regulation on human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs)of odontoblastic/osteogenic differentiation and proliferation function. Especially for the regulation of odontoblastic/osteogenic differentiation, we have verified this mechanism at the molecular level and characterization leveland this regulation also provides new ideas for dental pulp tissue engineering. At the same time, more than 3000 proteins related to the change of Stathmin level were screened by transcriptome sequencing technology, which provided a possibility to further exploration of the regulation mechanism of Stathmin on various aspects of cell biological characteristics.",Zhang X.; Ning T.; Wang H.; Xu S.; Yu H.; Luo X.; Hao C.; Wu B.; Ma D.,Journal,Journal of Proteomics,2019-06-30,Southern Medical University Stomatological Hospital;Hainan Provincial People's Hospital;Southern Medical University,Odontoblastic/osteogenic differentiation ;  Proliferation and migration ;  Stathmin ;  Wnt/β-catenin
Improving learning through cloud-based mobile technologies and virtual and augmented reality for australian higher education,"Latest technological innovations like Cloud-based mobile technologies and virtual and Augmented Reality (AR) have the ability to create great learning experiences. However, few researches exist regarding how AR can be utilized and integrated to complement learning. Currently, the existing research focuses on integrating AR in classes to aid students but few dwells on integrating AR in online learning platforms applications. The increased use of mobile devices has allowed the introduction of online learning management systems that allow people to access e-books, papers, and articles online. As technological inventions continue to emerge, there is a need to investigate and internalize how these new technologies can complement learning. In this research, we investigate how the integration of VR and AR and Cloud-based mobile technologies can improve learning in Australian Higher Education. We conduct a survey to determine how the integration of AR and artificial in the Moodle learning management system can impact the user experiences. We then discuss the current development in virtual and AR and Cloud-based mobile technologies in the education system through a literature review. Our preliminary analysis shows that integration of AR and artificial intelligence may lead to better learning experiences.",Sandu N.; Gide E.; Karim S.,Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2019-06-28,CQUniversity Australia,Artificial Intelligence ;  Augmented Reality ;  Mobile Cloud computing ;  Virtual Reality

Smart dispatching for energy internet with complex cyber-physical-social systems: A parallel dispatch perspective,"Energy internet (EI) is a complex coupled multienergy system; it is essential to investigate its multienergy dispatching optimization issues. To this end, this paper first proposes a novel conception of smart dispatching for EI with a complex cyber-physical-social system (CPSS) network from the perspective of parallel dispatch, called parallel dispatching robot (PDR), and investigates the implementations of PDR based on smart artificial society (SAS) modeling. First, we introduce EI and describe the dispatching issues of EI. Second, we discuss several important concepts supporting the parallel dispatch conception of EI, including knowledge automation (KA), CPSS, and parallel machine learning (PML). On the basis of these, we elaborate the concept of parallel dispatch. Moreover, we construct a large closed-loop feedback control framework of parallel dispatch for EI integrating a CPSS network based on KA and PML. Third, we establish an experimental platform for PDR research based on the proposed parallel dispatch framework. Fourth, we develop the PML-based SAS models of a single PDR in centralized dispatching modes and group PDRs in decentralized dispatching modes to achieve crowd wisdom emergence and performance improvement in current cyber-physical system frameworks of EI. Moreover, we design an external global closed loop for PDR to evaluate its operation stability. Lastly, we conduct a detailed discussion on PDR and offer some prospects for its engineering implementations. The biggest innovation of this paper lies in systematically proposing the smart dispatching concept and framework for complex CPSS-based EI from the perspective of parallel dispatch and thoroughly investigating how to use SAS modeling to implement parallel dispatching and control for EI considering human and social factors, which is a major extension and theoretical improvement to existing single smart wide area robot concept and a preliminary attempt in investigating a shift from Energy 4.0 to Energy 5.0 in China.",Cheng L.; Yu T.,Journal,International Journal of Energy Research,2019-06-25,South China University of Technology,ACP method ;  AI ;  complex system theory ;  cyber-physical system ;  cyber-physical-social system ;  energy internet ;  parallel dispatch ;  parallel dispatching robot ;  parallel intelligence ;  parallel machine learning ;  parallel system theory ;  smart artificial society modeling ;  smart dispatching ;  virtual and real interaction
Research on knowledge management technology of aerospace engineering based on big data,"In the era of big data, mass production, analysis and application of data have become a new trend. In the long-term design, production, operation and testing process of aerospace enterprises, a large number of valuable data have been generated. Collection and analysis of these data can improve the management of aerospace enterprises and gain competitive advantages. With the increase of semi-structured and unstructured data produced by aerospace enterprises year by year, how to store and analyze data, how to mine and share knowledge has become a major problem. The existing knowledge management system cannot meet the diversified needs of users only by traditional database technology. It also needs to combine distributed computing and storage technology to solve the problems of knowledge storage, knowledge sharing, knowledge mining, knowledge retrieval and recommendation in big data environment.

Rethinking Public Buildings' Functions: The Case for Participatory Design Methodology,"Municipalities often struggle with reconstructions and refurbishing of buildings in public ownership. This is not only because of limited expert capacities that municipalities struggle with (municipal architect position or urban planner position is vacant, or non-existent etc.) or lack of finances. There is an increasing need and demand from municipalities for redefining buildings' original purpose and finding new, sustainable and innovate functions. They have to decide not only how to reconstruct, but how to rethink its original purpose. The case study from a city of Slaný shows how participatory design can serve the goal of finding new functions of a public building and effectively contribute to the planning phase of reconstruction projects. Sustainable urban development should react to people's needs, new technologies and environmental challenges. Reconstruction projects should reflect innovations in both technologies and approaches and respond to newly emerged functions. The methodology demonstrated in the case study can serve as a tool for assessing preferences of citizens, needs of the municipality and bridge the gap between politicians, experts and citizens by supporting efficient communication and evidence-based decision making. Moreover, this case shows how to ensure social sustainability and project effectiveness by involving multidisciplinary teams, in this case architects, urban planners, sociologists, communications experts and environmental and engineering psychologists.",Kandusová V.; Vácha T.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,2019-06-21,Czech Technical University in Prague,
Global software engineering: Virtualization and coordination,"Technology and organizations co-evolve, as is illustrated by the growth of information and communication technology (ICT) and global software engineering (GSE). Technology has enabled the development of innovations in GSE. The literature on GSE has emphasized the role of the organization at the expense of technology. This book explores the role of technology in the evolution of globally distributed software engineering. To date, the role of the organization has been examined in coordinating GSE activities because of the prevalence of the logic of rationality (i.e., the efficiency ethos, mechanical methods, and mathematical analysis) and indeterminacy (i.e., the effectiveness ethos, natural methods, and functional analysis). This logic neglects the coordination role of ICT. However, GSE itself is an organizational mode that is technology-begotten, technology-dominated, and technology-driven, as is its coordination. GSE is a direct reflection of ICT innovation, change, and use, yet research into the role technology of GSE has been neglected. Global Software Engineering: Virtualization and Coordination considers existing fragmented explanations and perspectives in GSE research, poses new questions about GSE, and proposes a framework based on the logic of virtuality (i.e., creativity ethos, electrical methods, and technological analysis) rather than of rationality and indeterminacy. Virtuality is the primary perspective in this book’s comprehensive study of GSE. The book concludes with an integrated explanation of GSE coordination made possible through ICT connectivity and capitalization.",Wiredu G.,Book,Global Software Engineering: Virtualization and Coordination,2019-06-18,,

Scenario technique to elicit research and training needs in digital government employing disruptive technologies,"Technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, Internet of things, chatbots and other disruptive technologies may bring innovations to the public sector. However, the way in which such disruptive technologies could be deployed in various areas of digital government needs systematic investigation to understand emerging research and training needs. Future scenarios can be used as a method to elicit potential future evolutions of new technologies. In this paper, we suggest a future scenarios technique to identify research and training needs along the introduction of new disruptive technologies in the public sector. The paper describes the methodology of this scenario approach and an exemplification of identifying research and training needs relating to the implementation of Internet of things in public service provisioning, based on the application of the scenario approach. The methodology foresees expert engagement in the interactive workshops aimed at identification and prioritisation of the needs through a moderated discussion of the pre-constructed future scenarios.

Cross cutting concepts in an informal engineering setting (fundamental),"The participation gap between men and women in the E - Engineering component of STEM sectors is persistent. This gap may be traced back to several complex issues including perceived cultural concerns in engineering and young women self-selecting out of engineering career paths early in the middle school years [1]. Informal education settings may allow for a countermeasure to the cultural concerns which discourage female participation in the engineering sector. This case study reports on an informal engineering education program for 13 and 15-year-old girls, which fosters an environment where young women build interest, skills, confidence and an understanding of how their own goals, such as helping people, align with traditional STEM careers with a focus on engineering careers. This low-stakes setting, with high quality teachers, researchers and engineering students, allows for risk taking and experimentation which may be refined and expanded into the traditional classroom setting. Of particular interest, is how this informal setting may be used to strengthen this population's ability to make crosscutting concept connections in new ways and how this may be tied to motivation. This informal education program includes building participants' understanding of how their prior knowledge ties into engineering practices, their science core content knowledge and their crosscutting concept connections. Most importantly, student learning is centered on how crosscutting concepts in science pair with observations, insights and innovation in engineering design and problem solving. Participants come to the program with varying knowledge of engineering and science practices, core science concepts and crosscutting concepts prior to their participation in the program and this diversity of experience is considered in the programming. The program curriculum developers use unique methods to help the participants learn more about engineering, creative problem solving, how they might see themselves in these fields and how these experiences tie into crosscutting concepts. This study reports on the mechanisms used to structure crosscutting concept development with engineering practice connections. Additionally, innovations that are developed in this low stakes environment may lead to teaching tools which may transfer into traditional classroom settings.",Besser D.; Thomas A.; Farah R.; Brass T.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,"University of St. Thomas, Minnesota;St. Paul Academy",
Engineering leadership identity: A qualitative approach to understand the intersection of engineering and leadership identities,"Leaders in industry and government are calling for increasing innovation in STEM fields to maintain the nation's economic competitiveness. Solving today's complex challenges will require cooperation among experts from many fields. Successful leaders must harness the diverse capabilities of teams composed of these experts and be technically skilled. Undergraduate engineering students can fill this need by learning how to be effective leaders during their formation as engineers. Unfortunately, many engineering students graduate with little development of leadership skills; engineering educators do not currently have a sufficient understanding of how engineering students develop into leaders. This NSF ECE supported project seeks to improve educators' understanding of the interaction between leadership and engineering identities in the formation of undergraduate engineers. This work postulates that a cohesive engineering leadership identity should exist at the intersection of engineering and leadership identities. Now entering its second year the project is wrapping up its quantitative phase and is beginning the qualitative phase of investigation. This paper discusses the process of developing the qualitative research protocols used to explore identity formation in groups of undergraduate engineers at three different campuses. The discussion shows the formation of the protocol using prior work in leadership and engineering identity constructs from both this project and the literature. The protocol development, methods, and findings from early interviews are presented. Initial findings suggest several factors are important to engineering educators interested in developing engineers who are ready to lead. The findings include evidence of some level of conflict between engineering identity and leadership identity as well as further evidence of engineering students' compartmentalization of leadership as outside of engineering.

Concept maps as an assessment tool for evaluating students' perception of entrepreneurial mind-set,"With today's growing competitive economic market, having an entrepreneurial mindset can be instrumental for success. An entrepreneurial mindset encompasses the way a person thinks about a new idea, product, or innovation [1]. It can include elements such as approaches to product development, the ability to mitigate risk, creating new professional networks, and the ability to accept failure [2]. Students in both engineering and business can benefit from these skills, as these skills have widespread application in today's professional environments. In order to better understand how both business and engineering students perceived the term “entrepreneurial mindset,” this study utilized concept mapping to visually elicit business and engineering students' perspectives. Concept mapping is a useful assessment tool since it outlines relationships between ideas and concepts [3]. Using a concept map, it is possible to observe how students connect different attributes and topics to an overarching theme (in our case: “entrepreneurial mindset”). Two different methods of scoring concept maps were used: traditional and holistic. Using the concept maps, this study aimed to determine whether there were any observable differences between the two scoring methods. It also sought to determine whether concept maps produced by engineering undergraduates differed from those produced by business undergraduates In total, 19 engineering students and 6 business students participated in this study. We found that holistic and traditional scoring methods provided similar evaluation of the concept maps. The scoring methods were only able to reproducibly score the lower scoring concept maps whereas the remaining maps showed more variability. These differences may be due to the priorities of each scoring method. Traditional scoring is based on the quantity of information portrayed and the ability to create connections between topics. Holistic scoring is based on the range of topics involved with the main subject, the structure of the concept map, and the quality and correctness of each concept and connection. There were no statistically significant differences found between the traditionally and holistically scored concepts maps for either major although a medium effect size was observed when comparing participants' holistic comprehensiveness scores across disciplines. Results from this study demonstrate that when seeking to evaluate students' perceptions of an entrepreneurial mindset, the application of holistic scoring methods may be more effective in distinguishing detailed conceptual knowledge. Alternatively, the traditional scoring method may be more helpful when seeking a broader understanding of students' knowledge of a concept. Overall, each scoring method has its own benefits and disadvantages; therefore, the evaluation method selected should be based upon the focus of the research.",Martine M.; Mahoney L.; Sunbury C.; Schneider J.; Hixson C.; Bodnar C.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,Rowan University;Colorado Christian University,
Design and prototyping of two different mechanical testing instruments,"The modern human society is largely being faced with complex engineering challenges that are not confined to any particular engineering or science discipline. These problems require innovative solutions with a multidisciplinary approach which draws on various concepts and knowledge base in an iterative process. The 'Engineering Clinics' at Rowan University a design infused, multidisciplinary, eight-semester sequence of courses in the College of Engineering. Inter/multi-disciplinary student teams engage in laboratory hands on activities focused on solving real world problems related to automation, additive manufacturing, embedded systems, renewable energy, artificial intelligence and biomedical technology to name a few. The aim is to prepare the students for highly evolving, competitive marketplaces. It also serves as an excellent testbed for conceptualizing and iterating engineering innovation and research. This paper will discuss two projects where multidisciplinary groups of students develop prototypes of testing instruments. Project 1 involved designing a pharmaceutical vial seal force tester in collaboration with a local equipment manufacturing company. Seal force is the integrity of the sealing quality of the rubber stoppers that cap the pharmaceutical drug vials. The usual process of testing it is by performing a compressive test. The entire prototyping was accomplished in various phases. Project 2 was an independent undertaking that was conducted over a period of 2 semesters during which the student-faculty team conceived and developed an idea for marketing a low-cost mechanical testing equipment. The idea was to build a tensile, compressive tester using off the shelf component, keeping the selling price below $2500 per piece. The end users were initially targeted to be academic institutions and low strength material testing industrial customers. The paper will describe the device design and development process and resulting ABET student outcomes achieved.",Osta A.; Kadlowec J.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,Rowan University,
"Design, impact and best practices for a graduate research and innovation center","Since 2009, the University of Puerto Rico-Mayagüez (UPRM) implemented several assessment strategies to identify services and infrastructure to meet the needs of graduate students and faculty researchers. In general, results revealed the need for developing information literacy skills, technological infrastructure and physical facilities for collaboration. More specifically, assessment findings showed that researchers: (1) identified a need for assistance with technical writing, communication skills, search strategies, and ethical use of information; (2) expected new services encompassing data management, authorship, copyright, and organizing, sharing, and preserving information in the digital environment; and (3) needed a collaborative space where teaching and research services coincided. A grant, awarded by the U.S. Department of Education, has enabled the UPRM to facilitate research services across campus, broadening graduate offering in engineering programs and sustaining the research and innovation ecosystem across the entire research lifecycle. This award allowed the design and inauguration of the Graduate Research and Innovation Center (GRIC) in 2016, transforming the way the Library intervenes in our institution's research ecosystem. Overall, the GRIC provides (1) a holistic suite of services in which students can be referred to specialists, knowledgeable in the proper technology or content development expertise; (2) a robust technological infrastructure to support interdisciplinary and interactive collaborations; and (3) support to graduate students' needs as both information consumers and information producers. By design, the GRIC has become a testbed for activities that facilitate the implementation of the Association of College & Research Libraries' Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education. The paper will describe the design process for the GRIC, its impact in a two-year period, and the services offered at the Center with best practices and lessons learned in the process, that directly impact the research lifecycle.",Ayala-Gonzalez H.; Pomales-Garcia C.; Alvarez J.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,Recinto Universitario de Mayagüez,
Expanding and evolving an innovation concentration,"Recent reports published by the Walton Family Foundation [1] [2] highlight the importance of innovation to the US economy and the critical relationship between innovation, university research and education for workforce development and economic prosperity. To develop an innovation-based ecosystem, the US must produce more STEM graduates capable of driving innovation. “At the heart of an innovative local ecosystem is its capacity to absorb new knowledge for industrial use. Industrial innovation is defined by the capability and propensity to engage, translate, absorb and exploit new knowledge and the active participation of a university, including facilities, faculty, staff and students who can aid this process.” [2] In 2018, the US declined from fourth to sixth in the Global Innovation Index with the United Kingdom (fourth) and Singapore (fifth) advancing. [3] The 19 States comprising the “American Heartland” have a State Technology and Science Index (STSI) significantly below the mean for the US. And, five states in the southern Heartland are in the bottom ten for the country. [4] Research Universities can be (and are) major sources of innovation through the commercialization of their research. However, research does not need to be the only source of innovation from research universities. Innovation can also come through students by way of purposely developed or enhanced courses, pedagogy, and experiences designed to create a spark or foster an existing spark, fan the flames, and fuel them to help them grow. It is unfortunate to create the spark in first-year students and then ignore it until it is time for the senior design / capstone project; the innovators need to continue to learn, experience, and grow throughout their academic career. To be a meaningful real-world experience, an innovation concentration needs to incorporate learning and experiences within disciplines students will encounter once they have begun their professional career including: engineering (of many types); business, marketing, finance, accounting, manufacturing, supply chain, sales, and management; industrial design, architecture, science, service and support; and, an understanding of business customers and users - from first-year through to capstone. Translating this into pedagogy and curriculum means innovation-based or innovation-infused courses, problem-based and active learning-based, real-world experiences in partnership with the innovation ecosystem and a progression based on gaining knowledge, skills, and experience. And, to match the real-world, these courses need to be interdisciplinary, multi-disciplinary, transdisciplinary, and multi-college / multi-school (engineering, business, arts & sciences, architecture, etc.). Innovation is at the Venn diagram intersection of engineering, creativity and business, at the core of what is commercialized and provides the basis for entrepreneurship. Innovation is not a solution looking for a problem; it is a solution for a need. [5] Expanding and Evolving an Innovation Concentration describes our initiative to develop the concept, pedagogy, faculty, curriculum, outcomes, experience, and the students to create graduates who can engage, translate, absorb, apply critical thinking, and exploit this new knowledge of innovation, and who can innovate and experience this continuously through their academic career.",Schubert K.; Massey L.; Ellstrand A.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,University of Arkansas,
Students' perception of teaching practice in an active learning environment,"Physics Education Research has been very active since the late 70's trying to reduce the gap between what the instructor teaches and what the students learn. One of the most important results of that research is the design of educational strategies and materials that help instructors with their teaching. It has been proved that using research-based instructional strategies in which students participate in an active way; students learn better than that of those taught in a traditional setting. Based on the Teaching Practices Inventory, we designed a survey for physics engineering students in an active learning environment to gauge what, in their perspective, is important for their comprehension. The results indicate that what instructors know is essential for students' learning is not always the same as what students believe is important for their learning.",Dominguez A.; Zavala G.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,Tecnológico de Monterrey;Universidad Andrés Bello,Active Learning ;  Educational Innovation ;  Physics Education Research ;  Teaching Practices Survey
(Work-in-Progress) prototype desktop and augmented VR for delivering materials for graphics modeling and animation courses,"This paper explains the design of a prototype desktop and augmented Virtual Reality (VR) framework as a medium to deliver instructional materials to the students in an introductory computer animation course. This framework was developed as part of a Teaching Innovation Grant to propose a cost-effective and innovative instructional frameworks to engage and stimulate students. Desktop-based virtual reality presents a 3-dimensional (3D) world using the display of a standard desktop computer available in most of the PC labs on campus. This is a required course at this university that has students not only from the primary department, but from other colleges/departments as well. Desktop VR has been chosen as a medium for this study due to the ease-of-access and affordability; this framework can be visualized and accessed with the available computers in PC labs available in university campuses. The proposed research is intended to serve as a low-cost framework that can be accessed by all students. The concepts of 'computer graphics, modeling & animation', instead of being presented using conventional methods such as notes or power point presentations, are presented in an interactive manner on a desktop display. This framework allows the users to interact with the objects on the display not only via the standard mouse and keyboard, but also using multiple forms of HCI such as Touchscreen, Touchpad, and 3D Mouse. Hence, the modules were developed from scratch for access via regular desktop PCs. Such a framework helps effective pedagogical strategies such as active learning (AL) and project-based learning (PBL), which are especially relevant to a highly lab-oriented course such as this course titled 'Introduction to Animation'. Finally, the framework has also been tested on a range of VR media to check its accessibility. On the whole, this proposed framework can be used to not only teach basic modeling and animation concepts such as spatial coordinates, coordinate systems, transformation, and parametric curves, but it is also used to teach basic graphics programming concepts. Hence, instead of a touchscreen, the modules have to be developed from scratch for access via regular desktop PCs. Such a framework helps effective pedagogical strategies such as active learning (AL) and project-based learning (PBL), which are especially relevant to a highly lab-oriented course such as this animation course.",Chandramouli M.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,Purdue University Northwest,
What is advanced manufacturing? Exploring the topography of definitions,"Global economists have cited advanced manufacturing (AM) as one of the fastest growing, dynamic, and economically instrumental industry sectors in the world. In response, many community colleges and undergraduate-serving institutions have established technician education programs to prepare future workers to support AM vitality and innovation. However, in the rush to couple market and training demands, stakeholders have not agreed upon a definition of the field. Without a central notion of AM, the competencies and professional identities of AM workers are likewise unclear. In an effort to address this consensus gap, we undertook an extensive systematic review of AM definitions to chart of sector's topography, in an effort to understand AM's breadth and depth. The goals of this study were to: 1) define AM as perceived by policymakers and 2) identify important concepts and contextual factors that comprise and shape our understanding of AM. In this study, we used systematic policy and literature review approach to analyze canonical and research-based publications pertaining to AM's origins, components, and operational definitions. We classified, compared, and synthesized definitions of AM depending by stakeholder, for example, professional organizations, government agencies, or educational program accreditors. Among our notable findings is that in the eyes of policymakers, manufacturers are advanced not because they make certain products, but because they have adopted sophisticated business models and production techniques. Advanced manufacturers typically use a combination of three factors to remain competitive: “advanced knowledge,” “advanced processes,” and “advanced business models.” This study is both timely and important because in a dynamic field such as AM, educators and industry leaders must work together to meet workforce needs. Clear understanding of AM can inform competency models, bodies of knowledge, and empirical research that documents school-to-career pathways. Both our findings and our methods may shed light on the nature of related technical fields and offer industry and education strategies to ensure their alignment.",Pahuja D.; Mardis M.; Jones F.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,Florida State University,
"Innovation, design, and self-efficacy: The impact of makerspaces","In recent years, makerspaces have become an increasingly common feature in the engineering buildings of academic institutions. Through the creation and continued funding of these spaces, access to rapid prototyping technology has allowed for fast, straightforward project development across the engineering disciplines. While many hypothesize that students' participation within these facilities has a positive impact on their educational experiences and outcomes, there is little empirical data that describes how and to what extent individuals are impacted by exposure to a makerspace. In this paper, we seek to understand how the use of a university makerspace in a course project impacts students' engineering attitudes and skillsets as they relate to the makerspace. Our research team surveyed 172 undergraduate students in 6 unique courses that incorporate a makerspace based project into their curriculum. These courses varied by student year, department, subject matter, and project complexity. Each student was surveyed at the beginning and end of the semester, before and after they had completed a course project in the makerspace. The survey measured students' affect towards design, design self-efficacy, technology self-efficacy, innovation orientation, and sense of belonging within the makerspace. Survey items were validated through exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Subsequently, paired t-tests were used to analyze if, and how, these metrics changed within individual students over the course of one semester using the makerspace. By surveying this broad pool of students and exploring the ways in which students' attitudes change after completing a makerspace project, we can better understand how incorporating these assignments into a class impacts students' affect towards engineering and perception of their engineering efficacy.",Carbonell R.; Andrews M.; Boklage A.; Borrego M.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,The University of Texas at Austin,
Improving creative thinking in engineering students through ART appreciation,"Creativity thinking is a metacognitive process that allows not only complex problem solving but also a high degree of innovation that future engineers would need to perform disruptive tasks successfully. Given the difficulty that comes with the enhancement of a creative perspective using logical-scientific modality of thought, a need arises to consider disruptive innovations in teaching-learning approaches for new engineering programs. In this study, engineering students were given necessary trainings in creative thinking techniques in order for them to comply with: (i) acquiring competencies for a high degree of innovation; (ii) exploring through directions unknown and potentially risky and, (iii) embracing contradictions and integrating divergent perspectives and ideas. Different cognitive theories were used, specifically adapted for engineering students: firstly, theory of cognitive functioning and development of thoughts via artistic-narrative modality was taken into consideration. Secondly, the theory of mind development for integrating education across subjects were used as the basis of this study. The research was conducted using an experimental methodology with a sample size of 168 engineering students. To assess creative thinking competencies in a broad range of engineering work activities, the VALUE rubrics of the American Association of Colleges and Universities, AAC&U, were applied. The obtained results have shown that the designed approach promoted both desired abilities, a better understanding of scientific concepts among engineering students and also a higher capability to transform ideas and solutions into entirely new forms.",Caratozzolo P.; Alvarez-Delgado A.; Hosseini S.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Cognitive and metacognitive tools ;  Creative thinking ;  Educational innovation ;  Higher education ;  STEAM
Wireless water monitoring system and portable analysis platform product development progress in academia,"Clean water is important for public health and people have become more vigilant of monitoring potentially contaminated drinking water. In this project, students were advised to seek a solution to detect contaminated water by conducting market research on the industry and the public's needs, then based on these results, to engineer the device. After extensive customer discovery through the Texas A&M University National Science Foundation Innovation Site Program (NSF I-Site) that focuses on technology commercialization, students found that water quality is especially important to the everyday health-conscious consumer and to people working in the brewing industry. However, the value propositions of clean water differed greatly between these two promising customer segments which caused the project to pivot to focus on the brewing industry. The resulting device prototype was created with the market needs in mind as an affordable reusable device with real-time chemical analysis capabilities. This paper focuses on the educational progress and best practices students learned on engineering practical solutions to meet people's needs. It then introduces the resulting water monitoring system and its variant wireless portable analysis platform that is in development, the latter which was created as a response to the needs identified from market research.",Hur B.; Tsai G.; Casas R.; Davila E.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,Texas A&M University,
Towards full integration of physics and math concepts: Words versus meanings,"Mathematics and physics concepts have been closely interrelated since their formal beginnings in ancient times. Moreover, from a wide variety of perspectives, it is possible to identify that the understanding of physics progressed as more complex mathematical ideas became available. In pedagogical practice, there are many instances where the teaching of one of these disciplines might obstruct the understanding of the other; this problem, combined with the difficulty of teaching them inside or outside a classroom, produces a ripe opportunity for educative improvement. After a significant experience of teaching an integrated physics-math course for freshmen undergraduate students, a number of inconsistencies were identified and previously reported. One of those inconsistencies is a trap rooted in language, and it creates worrying cognitive conflicts that interfere with students' learning. Specifically, the use by teachers of different names for the same concepts or ideas (perhaps because they look to relate specific concepts to everyday language) might be helping misconceptions to prevail. In this work, the authors focused on the analysis of terms like mass, force, and torque. To do this, they analyzed various research sources and texts to identify the roots of different names for similar concepts and their uses, and they considered the consequences of differing terminology and meaning to the construction of complex thinking. Raising awareness about the inconsistencies of terminology in mathematics and physics and the resulting consequences is the primary objective of this study. This work was motivated by an authentic concern to facilitate the learning and comprehension of these subjects by students. Accordingly, the authors issue a call for action for a transformation in the teaching and learning of physics and mathematics through reflection on better use of terminology in these fields, so that the terms are negotiated between the disciplines, which results in precise descriptions of what is being taught, free of inconsistencies, confusion, and conflict.",Armenta I.; de la Garza Becerra J.; Dominguez A.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,Tecnológico de Monterrey;Universidad Andrés Bello,Conflicts in physics and math terminologies ;  Educational innovation ;  Interdisciplinary negotiation ;  Language of math ;  Physics ;  Physics and math integration ;  Words and meaning
A new approach in abolishing poverty: A case study and construction strategy for integrating inclusive innovation into engineering ethics education,"At present, macro engineering ethics urgently requires the engineering talents to play a positive role in realizing human welfare, maintaining social justice and world equality. Therefore, it is necessary to think about how to make engineering students better participate in solving major social development problems through engineering ethics education, especially with the help of engineering students' professional knowledge and product design ability to help 2.47 billion people in the world “tackle poverty and get rich”. Inclusive innovation proposes a new idea for solving this problem. Promoting the economic prosperity and abolishing poverty in developing countries are the purpose of inclusive innovation which guided by the idea of “building a community with a shared future for mankind”. This paper attempts to explore how to integrate inclusive innovation into engineering ethics education in order to provide a viable solution for improving the ability of engineering students to promote positive social change. Firstly, on the basis of explaining the connotation, characteristics and national practice of inclusive innovation, this paper puts forward that the core goals and philosophical starting points of engineering ethics and inclusive innovation are consistent, which provides the possibility and necessity for integrating inclusive innovation into engineering ethics education. Secondly, through the case analysis framework, which includes the three dimensions of “Concept-Pedagogy-Output”, we systematically analyzed the typical case of MIT D-Lab. Our paper finds that MIT D-Lab has developed the educational tenet from three levels of knowledge, consciousness and ability. Meanwhile, this tenet is achieved through interdisciplinary courses, technology development and community activities. In the end, engineering students can play the role of “product/service designer” and “technology promoter” in inclusive innovation, and provide affordable products and service to poor areas through “knowledge creation” and “product innovation”. In conclusion, this paper offers suggestions for integrating inclusive innovation into engineering ethics education in four aspects: (1) constructing the curriculum content system solving the poverty problem; (2) building a high-quality interdisciplinary teaching team; (3) using multi-functional collaborative external support network; and (4) innovative teaching methods to expose engineering students to the “real world”.",Li H.; Xie Y.; Yang S.; Xu R.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,Zhejiang University;Chinese Society for Engineering Education (CSEE,Case Study ;  Engineering Ethics Education ;  Inclusive Innovation ;  MIT D-Lab ;  Poverty alleviation

"Integrating mind, hand, and heart: How students are transformed by hands-on designing and making","Hands-on education - the integration of mind and hands - is often believed to transform the way that students think and learn. How and how much are students changed by hands-on education, and by what mechanisms do such transformations occur? This exploratory study considers 75 students in a 10-week engineering design and manufacturing course where, in many cases, students design and build a physical product for the first time. Students participate in labs through which they gain hands-on experience in milling, turning, forming, welding, and sand casting, among other manufacturing processes. Additionally, through several iterations of an individual project, each student builds a functional, high-fidelity, well-finished prototype of their own design. Drawing from Dewey alongside Lave and Wenger's theories of learning through experience and participation in communities of practice, we observe how students engage their mind, hands, and heart in a makerspace environment and the subsequent changes that they experience. We hypothesize that greater integration of students' mind, hands, and heart is associated with increased engineering task self-efficacy, innovation self-efficacy, engineering identity, and closeness of connection to a maker community. To examine these hypotheses, pre- and post-course surveys were administered in addition to written reflections throughout the course. Pre-post comparisons are performed on quantitative constructs and qualitative reflections contextualize the interpretation. Findings suggest that participation in this hands-on learning course is associated with large positive transformations in innovation self-efficacy, engineering task self-efficacy, and perceived connection between the self and maker community, and that these gains occur in all examined subgroups. On average, students report large increases in perceived connection between their “mind and hands” and “heart and hands,” with underrepresented minority (URM) women and non-URM men experiencing the largest increases in mind-hand-heart connection. Future research may examine how different groups of students, e.g. URM women, approach designing and making in academic makerspaces and how they come to perceive exceptional integration of mind, hand, and heart. Our findings also point to the underexplored and potentially substantial role of emotion in makerspace learning environments. These findings have implications for our understanding and support of designing and making in engineering education.",Brubaker E.; Maturi V.; Karanian B.; Sheppard S.; Beach D.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,Stanford University,Design Education ;  Engineering Identity ;  Hands-On Learning ;  Makerspaces ;  Manufacturing Education ;  Self-Efficacy
A workshop on new horizons for next generation manufacturing with student robotics learning experience,"The swift development of manufacturing within the U.S. has generated much interest in various industries. These industries include Food, Electronics, Medical, Energy, and Urban Manufacturing. Due to the traction of interest, large investments have been promoted by commercial and governmental organizations to promote innovative solutions from various disciplines to reduce costs, increase revenue, and remain a global competitor. The workshop provided insight to historical contexts of manufacturing provided by industry experts and displayed the importance of collaborative research from multidisciplinary fields of engineering. A direct correlation to diverse disciplines of engineering was given to display commercial necessity to solve complex problems with effective solutions. Such solutions to manufacturing require experimental studies to justify long term investment. The event was titled “The New Horizons for the Next Generation Manufacturing Workshop.” Students were given various presentations that were followed by a Q&A session. A luncheon was followed to increase industry networking and exchange of information. The hands-on robotics and automation competition proceeded the industry session. Student disciplines included electrical, mechanical, biomedical, computer, and industrial engineering. The competition involved complex problems for robotics and automation. Several 6-axis robots were combined with various sensors and integrated with Arduino to simulate a miniature desktop manufacturing process.

Creativity exercises to enhance innovation in undergraduate engineering design students,"This evidence-based practice paper describes the use of creativity practice exercises intended to enhance student creativity in a capstone design program. Engineering programs, in general, and capstone design programs, in particular, that seek innovative conceptual solutions to complex problems would benefit from techniques to develop and assess student creativity. Therefore, a study was performed to evaluate two such techniques. Over the first two years of the study, capstone design students in the United States Air Force Academy's Department of Engineering Mechanics were each assigned to one of 14 teams which received various learning experiences (treatments) intended to enhance individual creativity and design project innovation. Twelve of the 14 teams (n = 70) received an innovative engineering design curriculum while the control teams (n = 23) did not. Six teams (n = 37) experienced seven weekly creativity exercises across the fall semester, provided by Destination Imagination, while four teams (n = 56) did not. It was expected that the exercises would improve Creativity Index scores in students across the study as measured by the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT) Figural Test. The Creativity Index scores of the students were analyzed using an independent sample t-test to determine if any differences could be detected. Results after the first two years are positive, indicating that students that participated in the creativity enhancing treatments showed higher improvements in Creativity Index scores compared to the controls. However, the statistical significance of these findings are not strong, presumably due to the small sample size. Therefore, the research will continue in subsequent years. In addition, evaluation of the design teams' concepts by experienced engineering design faculty indicated that the teams that participated in the creativity exercises exhibited greater innovation in their design process versus the control. Finally, students reported that the exercises are fun and help them expand their way of thinking to consider unexpected solutions to a diverse array of challenges.",Anderson M.; Anderson K.; Jensen D.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,Singapore University of Technology and Design;United States Air Force Academy;Destination Imagination Inc,
The in/authentic experiences of black engineers,"The computer and information technology industry has received much attention in recent years due to its lack of diversity and the toxic culture in these companies. The United States population is 13% Black, but this representation is not reflected in the technology workforce. In fact, fewer than 5% of tech company employees identify as Black. These factors lead many Black employees to leave, costing companies billions of dollars to fill their positions-not to mention their perspectives and expertise. The lack of diversity can also affect worker wellbeing, productivity, and innovation. To interrogate this issue, our study examines the experiences of Black engineers through their own narratives. We aim to interview 40 engineers within the technology industry to understand their working conditions. The interviews will be held with 10 each of: Black males, Black Females, White males, and White females, in order to attend to the intersectional nature of race and gender. Each participant will provide their own individual experiences, which will allow us as researchers to examine, compare, and contrast across all accounts. Specifically, we will conduct narrative analysis using three different frameworks: Faulkner's in/authenticity, Helms and Piper's pairing of racial identity theory and vocational psychology, and Kendi's history of racist ideas. Our findings will add to the depth of research on diversity by presenting our findings to stakeholders within the industry through different modes including presentations to industry leaders and at professional conferences. The end goal of this project is to create a more welcoming and diverse community within the computer and information technology industry.",Douglas E.; McCray E.; Dietz G.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,University of Florida,
Emerging support systems for entrepreneurship education in the context of an ambitious national reform in Chilean engineering schools,"The purpose of this study is to characterize the support systems for entrepreneurship education in five Chilean engineering schools that were part of Ingeniería 2030, a national program launched in 2012. This program sought to strengthen applied research, technology transfer, and entrepreneurship education in engineering schools. Overall, Ingeniería 2030 granted about US$60 millions over a six-year period. As a result, engineering schools implemented unprecedented efforts to promote and support entrepreneurship among undergraduate students. In this context, we pose the following question: What are the main strategies the selected engineering schools use for the promotion of entrepreneurship education? To address this question, we conducted 20 semi-structured interviews with professional staff (12) in the newly created entrepreneurship units, as well as top administrators (3) and faculty members (5). We also analyzed archival documentation, such as web sites and Ingeniería 2030 reports. The results indicate that the main strategies for supporting entrepreneurship education are related to four issues. First, a tension exists in these mostly traditional schools in terms of their role as conventional institutions and what is expected of them as entrepreneurial schools. Second, schools struggle with balancing and connecting curricular and co-curricular activities. Third, professional staff and administrators view engineering faculty members as conflicted by research demands on the one hand, and pressure to get involved in entrepreneurship educational initiatives on the other. Fourth, regular academic demands are seen as a barrier to get more students involved in entrepreneurial activities. These issues must be addressed in order to understand how the national policy for stimulating innovation and entrepreneurship in engineering schools is reshaping the university ecosystems in ways that are more or less consistent with institutional contexts.",Zapata M.; Celis S.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,Universidad de Chile,
Provoked emotion in student stories reveal gendered perceptions of what it means to be innovative in engineering,"Focus on the role of motivation and emotions as part of engineering entrepreneurial definitions pose an intriguing question: Might understanding how college students characterize a new graduate's entrepreneurial action be crucial for expanding a definition of innovation and infusing new elements in the curriculum? In this paper, we utilized students' interpersonal perceptions of another to parse out the definition of innovativeness, finding that gender matters for achievement motivation and affiliation motivation in conceptualizing an engineer/founder/CEO. The study included two independent elements (gender cue prompt and gender of participant) and studied effects of these variables on both the story-oriented dependent variable and mood scale reports for the characterization of the engineer/founder/CEO. Eighty-three participants on both coasts of the United States and in Northern Europe provide vivid action shots and stunning motivational characterizations.

Pedagogical ninjas: Using an additive innovation cycle for faculty development of teaching-focused faculty,"This evidence-based, practice paper describes a semester-long, faculty development program designed by an “additive innovation” [1] framework to promote the sharing, scaling, sustainability, and implementation of a pedagogical risk-taking culture across a school of engineering. This intervention has been developed as part of a research project that is funded by the National Science Foundation “Revolutionizing Engineering and Computer Science Departments” (RED) program [2]. The structure of the faculty development program is described, focusing on practical strategies that were found effective in guiding the interventions. Fifteen participants engaged in a series of structured events to design and implement their own pedagogical innovations in their classroom during the semester of Fall 2018. The paper describes the events that took place in the program, shares lessons learned, and highlights future work to analyze the data collected from the activities further.",Ali H.; Bekki J.; Brunhaver S.; Jordan S.; Lande M.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,South Dakota School of Mines & Technology;Arizona State University Polytechnic Campus;Arizona State University,
Model-building in engineering education,"This paper reports on research that is part of a lager project taking place at a mid-sized public HBCU funded through the National Science Foundation's Revolutionizing Engineering and computer science Departments (RED) program. The purpose of the RED program is to encourage and support innovation projects that develop new, revolutionary approaches and change strategies that enable the transformation of undergraduate engineering education [1]. A vital component of this particular RED project involves the development and validation of survey-based measures of Engineering Values, Self-Efficacy, and Identity: and a model that combines the constructs into a causal sequence aimed at explaining the motivators of student learning. Past research [2], reported on the results of the first stage in this broader research objective. This paper reports on the second stage in the development and assessment of an Engineering Values Scale (EVS), an Engineering Self-Efficacy Scale (ESES), an Engineering Identity Scale (EIDS), and an exploratory model aimed at explaining student engagement in extracurricular engineering-related activities.",Walton T.; Knisley S.; McCullough M.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University,
Entrepreneurial intentions and actions of engineering graduates: What contributes to increased intentions and continued entrepreneurial skill development?,"Some engineering graduates have the intention to become entrepreneurs. To bring this kind of intention to reality, graduates need additional skills beyond their engineering knowledge by the time they start their entrepreneurial career. In this paper we analyze Entrepreneurial Intentions of engineering graduates and explore the impact of activities to convert intentions into actions. Furthermore, we investigate what entrepreneurs were already doing as students in order to gather relevant skills for starting a venture. While previous research has focused more on Entrepreneurial Intentions within either engineering or business majors [1], or on the psychological side of intentions [2], this current work bridges the gap between intentions and Entrepreneurial Actions. Our work is based on qualitative semi-structured interviews of participants in the Engineering Majors Survey (EMS) 1. All 16 interviewees participated at least at two of the three nationally-representative, longitudinal Engineering Majors Surveys. The EMS is a survey designed to explore engineering students' technical, innovation, and entrepreneurial interests and experiences over time. The interviewees in this study had relatively high Entrepreneurial Intentions compared to the average of all EMS participants. Furthermore, they are categorized into three groups, that are characterized by people with increasing Entrepreneurial Intentions, decreasing Entrepreneurial Intention, or those whose intentions remained constant during the surveys. Our open-ended interview questions were based on Flanagans' critical incident method [3] and enabled additional follow-up questions in order to deepen understanding of certain answers and situations. All interviews were recorded, transcribed and coded according to Corbin and Strauss' [4] inductive coding strategy. The analysis of the codes shows that students and early career professionals value the possibility of having an impact as well as taking responsibility for founding their own company. Furthermore, financial independence as a self-employee is another motivating factor for a significant number of interviewees.",Schnell C.; gen Westarp J.; Sheppard S.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,Technische Universität München;Stanford University,
Assessment of a university makerspace using a quantitative and qualitative student survey,"This research paper focuses on the assessment of a makerspace at the University of Pittsburgh through the use of a student survey designed to answer whether the space is achieving its goals and how it is impacting users. As the rate of technological and societal change continues to increase, further emphasis is being placed on training skilled engineers, and calls for changes in engineering education to better prepare engineers for the future have been made. One approach institutions have taken towards achieving this is through the use of makerspaces. Anecdotal and indirect evidence support the use of these facilities to improve engineering skills in students. The makerspace of interest was built two years ago employing many of the best practices used at other institutions, and is also an integral part of a larger program at the university. To date, minimal data has been collected concerning the efficacy of the makerspace. To assess the makerspace, an anonymous survey comprised of Likert scale items, open-ended questions, and other quantitative questions was distributed electronically to both undergraduate and graduate engineering students. It asked students to rate statements about the makerspace related to its mission, and to rate statements about how using the space has improved different aspects of themselves. The results of the survey showed that the makerspace appears to be achieving its goals and is functioning as part of the university's efforts to increase student innovation and entrepreneurship. It showed that students feel using the makerspace has had positive effects on them, especially their creative thinking and ability to work on a team. It also revealed what aspects of the facility could potentially be improved. This evaluation contributes to the increasing body of knowledge on makerspace practices and potential impact on students.",Dosse L.; Mena I.; Clark W.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,University of Pittsburgh,
Meeting industry needs for professional and technical skills with new graduate degrees,"The role and latitude of the engineering profession is changing rapidly. Global issues, technological innovation, expansion of discipline boundaries, and increased professional expectations are transforming what engineers do and how they do it. Society is demanding engineering graduates, with strong technical knowledge who can think creatively and critically, effectively communicate, and work in teams to solve challenging problems. The earliest engineering disciplines, civil, mechanical and electrical, have given rise to distinct engineering specialties and application‐based disciplines. Many contemporary engineering problems are considered to be multi‐disciplinary in nature and require systems thinking in problem formulation and solution. It is clear that we must educate engineering students for a technological era of increased scope, scale and complexity. Future engineering expertise will require a higher intellectual level than currently provided. Research and anecdotal information identify a trend in the demand for graduate level education prior to entering the workforce that encompasses both hard technical and soft non-technical skills. Technology and industry needs are influential factors in education. Industry relies on distinctive skills to innovate and compete and engineering students expect that academic institutions will introduce them to appropriate technologies for their successful transformation into industry. Thus, academic institutions are challenged to adopt appropriate strategies to meet the innovative educational demand by both students and industry [1]. To address the increasing industry demand for workers to have advanced education and the accompanying increase in undergraduate engineering enrollment, The Citadel developed new MS graduate degrees in three programs to meet demands. By employing a multi-disciplinary approach existing non-technical graduate degree courses, focusing on management and leadership, that can be taken to fulfill electives better prepare graduate students to meet employer and industry requirements. As a result, MS engineering programs have seen increased enrollments and partnerships with other departments and industry connections. Various elective tracts provide the opportunity for students to earn graduate certificates in soft skills in addition to technical MS degree in just 10 courses. Given that the target population are working professionals, students take courses in the evening and can complete a MS degree in less than two years. This paper discusses the development of the three new MS programs with specific details on the mechanical program for technical course work paired with the project management for non-technical coursework. Additional details are provided on the development of online offerings for future students who do not have the option for face to face classes. Qualitative and quantitative student feedback are also discussed, showing the positive impact the programs have on engineering, as well as students' positive perceptions of the programs for preparation of professional skills.",Rabb R.; Greenburg D.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,The Citadel - The Military College of South Carolina,
Student persistence and university transitions in STEM majors: Community college students' challenges and successes,"There is a critical need for more students with engineering and science majors to enter into, persist, and graduate from postsecondary institutions. Increasing the diversity in engineering and science is also a profound identified need. According to national statistics, the largest groups of underrepresented minority students in engineering and science attend United States public higher education institutions and in particular the community colleges. Recent research has indicated that students from these populations who are strong problem solvers, and who understand how to seek assistance and navigate college campuses are most likely persist to degree completion. Accordingly, this research examined a sample of non-traditional college students enrolled in science and engineering programs in nine urban community colleges to determine (a) the types and frequency of support practices they utilized, (b) how such practices influenced their achievement, persistence and transfer status to four-year colleges and universities, and (c) how in turn their propensity for innovation and creative problem solving affected such choices and persistence. The study analyzed the impact of pedagogical support practices-practices designed to foster successful transfer from community college to four-year colleges and universities, and how students' innovative capability affected such transfer capacity. The goals were: (a) to understand whether particular pedagogical support practices were effective in offering nontraditional students a program that enabled them to persist in engineering and science majors and to transfer to a four-year college or university, and (b) to determine if students' propensity for innovative problem solving influenced their use of pedagogical practices and ultimately, transfer persistence. The research targeted four research questions: (1) What are the patterns of pedagogical practices that community colleges employ to enhance students' transfer success in engineering and science? (2) How do students' creative and innovative problem-solving approaches influence the choices that they make in using pedagogical support practices? (3) What are the impacts of pedagogical practices and differences among pedagogical practices on persistence toward students' transfer to colleges and universities? (4) How do students' creative and innovative problem-solving approaches influence their persistence toward transfer to engineering and science programs at four-year universities? This research is ongoing and involves a multi-stage study in which in the first stage, the types of pedagogical support practices used in community colleges were analyzed and taxonomized at four community colleges. Results of this part of the research led to the delineation and refining of three categories of student pedagogical support: (1) College attending support, (2) Program planning and execution support, and (3) Classroom and program performance support. These categories led to development and refinement of a college level pedagogical practice taxonomy and inventory which was used in a second and third stage of the research in which data was collected on 4929 community college students in STEM majors. The intent of the research is to determine the role of students' creativity and propensity of innovation on their persistence in STEM and the impact that use of particular pedagogical support practices had on persistence, creativity and propensity for innovation in STEM. Structural equation models (SEMs) have been developed and updated with multiple rounds of data collection. These models have been used for data analyses with one containing grade point average (as a proxy for achievement) as the outcome of interest and the second with engineering creativity and propensity for innovation as the outcome of interest, both of which address the study's research questions. Thus far the models indicate that frequency of use of pedagogical practices impact students' creativity and propensity for innovation and propensity for innovation impacts students' achievement (GPA). Notably, students' background characteristics also have pronounced impacts on the two outcomes of interest. In addition to informing engineering education research, this research provides community college faculty and student affairs personnel with insight as to which types of student support practices best support students in STEM majors to transfer to colleges and universities and how students' creativity and propensity for innovation affects students' transfer persistence.",Ragusa G.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,University of Southern California,
Preliminary findings from a comparative study of two bio-inspired design methods in a second-year engineering curriculum,"The engineer of 2020 is expected to not only offer technical ingenuity but also adapt to a continuously evolving environment while being able to operate outside the narrow limits of one discipline and be ethically grounded in solving the complex problems of the future. To build the competencies of the future engineer, undergraduate education must train students to not only solve engineering challenges that transcend disciplinary boundaries, but also communicate, transfer knowledge, and collaborate across technical and non-technical boundaries. One approach to train engineers in these competencies is teaching biomimicry or bio-inspired design in an engineering curriculum. Our research addresses the gap in resources for effectively teaching engineering students how to perform bio-inspired design by creating instructional resources based on Concept-Knowledge (C-K) design theory. C-K theory is known for integrating multiple domains of information and facilitating innovation through connection building. We used this theory to create lectures, in-class activities, assignments, rubrics and templates that scaffold the discovery and knowledge transfer processes involved in using natural designs to inspire engineering solutions. To assess the learning impact of our C-K theory instructional resources, we conducted a statistical comparison of student projects produced in a second-year engineering class exercise using instructional resources from C-K design theory and from the popular Biomimicry Institute (BI) design lens approach. A total of 105 students consented to participate; 2 course sections (N=51) used the C-K approach and 3 course sections (N=54) used the BI approach. Scores assigned to the students' concepts were used to test whether the C-K approach resulted in higher quality design concepts. The sections using the C-K approach were found to generate concepts that more closely resembled biological inspiration, meaning that they demonstrated innovating from nature rather than simply copying from nature. They were also more successful in abstracting biological system principles to create high quality concepts. Sections using the BI approach generated concepts that more closely resembled biological imitation, meaning that they tended to fixate on observable features and produced concepts that look or act exactly like the biological systems. These findings provide conclusive evidence of learning impact and support design theory based bio-inspired design pedagogy.",Nagel J.; Rose C.; Pidaparti R.; Tafoya E.; Pittman P.; Knaster W.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,University of Georgia;James Madison University,
"The diversified implementation path of China's ""New Engineering "" construction and the university's choice of paths","Background Emerging Engineering Education (3E) is a reform direction of engineering education based on the new needs of China's strategic development and the new situation of international competition. Compared with traditional engineering, new engineering generally refers to an emerging field of engineering, which is newly born and has not yet formed a complex of relatively mature engineering education concept, disciplinary structure, talent cultivation model, teaching quality standard, organizational operation mechanism and supportive service system. At present, Chinese colleges and universities actively promote the pilot reform of new engineering majors. 612 projects from universities across the country have been recognized as the first batch of ""New Engineering"" research and practice projects by the Ministry of Education, indicating that the construction of new engineering in universities has entered the implementation stage. Purpose/Hypothesis This study in-depth interviews with 15 typical ""New Engineering"" universities, aiming to extract the implementation path of ""new engineering"" in China, and provide a useful reference for the development of ""new engineering ."" Specifically, the research questions in this study are: (1) What are the core paths of China's new engineering construction? (2) What is the selection model of the ""new engineering"" construction path for different types of colleges and universities? Design/Method Firstly, based on the previous literature, the theoretical model of ""new engineering"" construction was constructed. Then, through semi-structured interview method, the first-hand data of new engineering path selection in colleges and universities was obtained, and content analysis technology was applied to analyze the data in a bid to verify the theoretical model extract key factors in the construction of new engineering in colleges and universities eventually. Results Research shows that the path of discipline integration, the path of discipline derivative, the path of Exogenously industry-led, and the path of Endogenously discipline-driven have become the main paths for the construction of ""new engineering"" in colleges and universities. Moreover, the path of engineering innovation has also been fully affirmed by some universities. The nature of disciplines along with the types and characteristics of colleges and universities exerts an influence over the choice of new engineering pathways in universities, universities and colleges at local level have relatively restricted options in the path of new engineering construction. Conclusions Based on the data results, the research further explores the connection and combination model between the university's main body and the new engineering construction path.(1) engineering advantaged college and universities can take advantage of technology and engineering, and give priority to the ""the exogenously industry-led"" transformation path and the ""disciplinary integration"" new path.(2) Comprehensive universities should give full play to the supporting role of basic disciplines and the advantages of cross-disciplinary integration. New engineering will be built through the path of ""discipline-derived"" and ""disciplinary integration"" .(3) Local universities and colleges should give priority to adopting the ""the exogenously industry-led"" path, construct a collaborative education system for deep cooperation between schools and enterprises, and enhance the service capabilities of region-oriented advantaged industries.",Wei L.; Zhang W.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,Zhejiang University,
Teaching hands-on racecar design in a summer pre-college program,"Competitive motorsports at the undergraduate level has become an increasingly popular extra- and co-curricular activity at universities throughout the world. The importance of these experiential, industry-centered projects has long been understood by serving as a true proving ground for students while giving them the upper hand with industry recruiters. Competitions sanctioned by SAE International (formerly the Society of Automotive Engineers) generally occur at the end of the school year (May/June), thereby making the summer months a critical time for student teams to reflect on their previous designs and to start proposing innovations for the subsequent season. The Formula SAE (FSAE) team at The Cooper Union in New York City has used this time to immerse high school students in this real-world activity in their college's summer STEM program. This 6-week intensive summer program is separated into two main modules. The first module focuses on teaching students the fundamentals of engineering experimentation that culminate in oral presentations detailing their findings. These experiments include the study of cantilever beams, electric motors, water pumps, flame speed vs. air-fuel ratio, and basic electronics and microcontroller exercises. After the first week of experiments, students develop a design project that is inspired by an urgent research problem the FSAE team needs to solve. During the past three years, these have included: 1) rebuilding, instrumenting and using a torsion rig to characterize the torsional rigidity of the vehicle's frame, 2) building and using a dynamic impact attenuator test rig, 3) aggressive use of carbon fiber for weight savings in the steering wheel, suspension, pedal system, impact attenuator, and body, 4) novel techniques for the design and manufacture of aerodynamic features, 5) electronic data acquisition system, or DAQ and 6) building a brake dynamometer. Weekly design 'sprints' were given by each team where they presented an update of their project to the entire class and were then critiqued on their engineering method as well as their technical communication skills. In addition to exposing the STEM fields to high school students as they explore college and career choices, this program was also a critical learning environment for the teaching assistants who mentored these students. Entry and exit surveys were used as assessment tools to gauge the efficacy of the program in providing the students with a better appreciation for the opportunities available in the STEM professions and if the program itself changed their desire about what profession they would want to explore in college.",Delagrammatikas G.; Rodas E.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,,
Making the makers: Building hands-on skills to help humanity through first-year design,"This complete evidence-based practice paper examines structure and student feedback of a pilot offering of “Engineering Design & Society”, a new hands-on first-year course teaching human-centered design to inspire engineering students to become innovators to help humanity. Students are actively engaged in practicing the human-centered design and prototyping process while learning makerspace and hands-on skills (solid modeling, 3D printing, programming, microelectronics, sensors, actuators, basic hand & power tools). Students then practice and incorporate these skills in a multidisciplinary team to research, design, build, document, and present on their functional prototype of a solution to help humanity to meet specific needs. The course is centered on experiential learning for all first-year engineering students through hands-on education in a classroom structured as a makerspace. Students collaborate at worktables in teams, each team with their own tools, with a dedicated class suite of 3D printers and other maker tools to help students not only design, but also physically build and program functional prototypes. The goals and benefits of the Engineering Design & Society course are to: 1) Promote a culture of making in first-year students through early introduction of solid modeling, programming, sensors, data acquisition, 3D printing, and other maker tools; 2) Help students learn techniques to solve open-ended engineering challenges; 3) Build student self-confidence in their individual making skills (especially for female and minority engineering students) to increase student hands-on participation in engineering societies, innovation challenges, and internships, and 4) Build teamwork and cooperative learning skills through participation in multidisciplinary teams. This complete evidence-based work outlines the curriculum characteristics of this first-year course. Impact on students is examined both quantitative and qualitatively through student self-reported surveys from the pilot sections of the course. Survey data examines student perceptions on how the structure and content of the course impact student identity as makers and their self-confidence in making skills. Student self-reported data on gender, ethnic background, major, prior programming experience, and prior building experience are included to examine maker-centered impact across a diverse background of first-year engineering students.",Dickrell P.; Virguez L.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,University of Florida,
"The professional doctorate in technology leadership, research & innovation","Expertise demands engendered by the convergence of pressure for increased competitiveness and the accelerating advance of technology have become obvious to leaders in technology-centric business and industry. Because the Polytechnic's faculty maintain active engagement with such business and corporate leaders and their enterprises, they also recognized signals which evidenced that there were responsible personnel in the private sector who would benefit from, and actually want, an advanced technology-oriented degree above the master's level. But, the faculty also noted that because of the career development stage and responsibilities of these personnel, they were not likely to be willing, or able, to pursue a traditional university Ph.D. A thought-leading team of Polytechnic faculty from diverse departments was assembled to research and conceptualize what such a degree might look like and how it might be best delivered. The team launched two parallel research efforts, one to ascertain what precedents and experiences with similar goals existed around the world, i.e., an international review of other doctoral programs addressing similar needs, and the second was to conduct an interest and needs assessment of a sample of high probability individuals. The findings of both studies were positive, and their key features incorporated in this paper. This paper describes the outcomes of a successful program development and approval process and the planned phasing of its implementation. The development team treated the existing program approval mechanisms, as found in most universities and states, as a stagedgate approval process. This necessitated the development of (1) a conceptual proposal, (2) a competitive analysis, (3) a detailed program plan, (4) an implementation plan, and (5) a formal proposal with supporting data as required by the state coordinating body for higher education. The program that evolved from this process was an industry-facing, distance/on-campushybrid professional doctoral program permitting extensive tailoring of the learning experiences. This enables enrollees to address a need/problem/issue specific to their enterprise while simultaneously accomplishing and advancing along on one or more of the program's key competency vectors. This paper provides an overview of the initial set of program competencies and describes their intended use for candidate assessment (both self and by program faculty). Competency components and scaffolding for building expertise as candidates progress to earn their degrees are also described. In addition to the description of the actual doctoral program, this paper will also share the support mechanisms necessary to deploy such a program in a doctoral extensive land grant university. Specifically highlighted will be the role of a dedicated business unit designed to streamline typical university bureaucracy in order to provide responsiveness and services consistent with the expectations of a competitive private sector world. Finally, this paper concludes with an overview of the program's next steps and the sharing of a set of collegial questions directed to other institutions interested in addressing similar needs.",Newton K.; Springer M.; Dyrenfurth M.; Naimi L.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,Purdue Polytechnic Institute,
Co-designed research agenda to foster educational innovation efforts within undergraduate engineering at HSIS,"The responsibility to educate and empower underrepresented groups in undergraduate education often relies on the commitment of educators and the curricula they design. Without financial or institutional support, there are limited opportunities for educators from different Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) to engage in conversations about their curricula developments and share their vision for the future of engineering education. This multi-institutional research project adopted a participatory research design to recognize the existing efforts of educators and foster their curricula and scholarship ideas. A series of three workshops were conducted in 2018 by visiting educators engaged in engineering education at both two and four-year HSIs. Before, during, and after the workshop series, attendees were asked to reflect on three guiding educational philosophies: intrinsic motivation, students as empowered agents, and design thinking. Thirty-six engineering educators from thirteen HSIs from across the Southern United States participated in one of two, two-day workshops where attendees prototyped examples of how they would implement these philosophies at their home institution. Using these prototypes, participants identified the assets they already had and resources they would still need to obtain. Following a thematic analysis of these prototypes from the initial workshops, five themes were identified and prepared for dissemination at the third workshop. Ten participants from the initial workshops attended the final workshop conducted at the 2018 ASEE Annual Conference, and an additional five participants joined as general ASEE Annual Conference attendees. In the final workshop, participants engaged with the preliminary results, further reflected on their progress since the first workshop, and brainstormed research questions they believed the engineering education research community would benefit from answering. The results of this research paper are based on the perspectives of forty-one engineering educators, with a focus on qualitative analysis of questions proposed from fifteen participants at the final workshop. Five research areas emerged: Engineering curricula enhancement, Understanding our students, Faculty development relevant to HSIs, Perceptions of instructional faculty, Long-term impactful approaches. This paper therefore aims to support broader engagement in research and collaboration with and within HSIs, with a goal of increasing the representation of Latinx students in engineering. The results have the potential to target and foster further collaborative scholarly research between educators and promote their curricular efforts in undergraduate engineering education at HSIs.",Henderson G.; Kendall M.; Basalo I.; Coso Strong A.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,University of Miami;Florida International University;The University of Texas at El Paso,
Ethical education in engineering: A pedagogical proposal based on cognitive neurosciences and adaptative complex systems,"The contemporary society characterized by inter/multi/trans-disciplinary, globalization, multiculturalism, connectivity, continuous change, complexity, and the rapid advance of science and technology, generate new challenges in the ethical formation of future engineers. Although the education of engineering students has made advances in curricular, pedagogical and didactical areas with the support of new technologies, ethical training has not significantly advance at the educational level. It requires a new pedagogical framework that facilitates engineering faculty to innovate in the teaching and learning processes of ethics training that will enable new generations of engineers to adapt to the socio-cultural, technological demands and dynamics of the 21st century. This paper highlights innovative processes in the ethics formation of engineers from the inter/multi/trans-disciplinary perspective based on new fundamentals that integrate Research & Development and Education (R+D+E). In addition, this paper shows the pedagogical foundations of the processes of teaching and learning for the formation of engineering students in ethics and its relationship with the Integral Formation of the Engineer based on fundamentals of cognitive neuroscience and adaptive complex systems. The proposed framework for ethics training, allows for a contextualized and meaningful learning model for new engineers favoring the inter/multi/trans-disciplinary with the development of social and cross-cultural skills, emotional intelligence, social and ethical responsibility, adaptive leadership, creativity & innovation, critical thinking & resolution of complex problems, communication & collaboration skills, team work, global awareness, environmental cognizance, flexibility & adaptability, resourcefulness, citizenship competencies, among others.",Cruz L.; Moreno W.; Howell J.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,"University of South Florida, Tampa;Ibero-American Science and Technology Education Consortium (ISTEC;Complex Systems and Education Network",Cognitive neuroscience ;  Engineering ethics ;  Ethics ;  Ethics ;  Ethics training and complex systems ;  Inter/multi/trans-disciplinary
Work-in-progress: Social networks analysis in the transition of an educational model among groups of stem teachers,"This work-in-progress research focuses on understanding and describing how nineteen groups of university engineering and science educators learn and assimilate the new educational model being adopted in a private Mexican university. Their role is to face the forces of globalization that are transforming the system of higher education in the university. This investigation adopts the notion of Social Network Analysis (SNA) to characterize and visualize the patterns of interactions among the different teams of teachers. Education research has been supported more frequently in recent decades by the analysis of social networks, which is a tool to quantify and visualize connections and structures of relationships and interactions within organizations. With this perspective, it has been possible to deepen the study of the nature and the determinants of interactions among teachers [1]. The data from a questionnaire applied to the team of participating educators was used at the beginning of the deployment of the new educational model known as the Tec21 Educational Model. The support patterns and collaborative networks of the educators are represented from the data through sociograms and descriptive social network indicators such as density, transitivity, and reciprocity in the network [2]. This approach is a methodological and pedagogical innovation because it has the potential to inform and provide feedback about the participants' work, promote reflection on their collaborative practices and contribute to cohesion, dialogue and the flow of knowledge within the team to continuously improve the internalization of the new educational model.",Castro E.; López I.; Zavala G.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,Tecnológico de Monterrey;Universidad Andrés Bello,Educational Change ;  Educational Innovation ;  Social Network Analysis ;  Teacher Collaboration
Students' abilities to solve RC circuits with research-based educational strategies,"One of the main research lines of Physics Education Research is students' conceptual understanding. Since the'70s, that line of research has produced not only research papers but also educational material that helps instructors teach physics in a coherent and structured way so that students can understand physics better. We have applied several of these research-based materials in our electricity and magnetism course for physics engineering students and have obtained good results regarding learning gain measured by some standard tests. In this paper, we focus on the effect of students' understanding of physics concepts on their problem-solving ability from a quantitative perspective. We chose RC circuits given the lack of time devoted to problem-solving in the class on this topic. The results indicate that even though students understand basic concepts such as potential difference, current, capacitance, and resistance, they struggle when trying to apply those concepts to solving RC circuits problems. On the other hand, we also show that students with good quantitative results, at the same time, have good qualitative results.",Zavala G.; Martinez-Torteya C.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,Tecnológico de Monterrey;Universidad Andrés Bello,Educational Innovation ;  Physics Education Research ;  Physics Engineering ;  RC Circuits
Software engineering and human-computer interaction: Students' perception of a project-based approach in a postgraduate course,"This work in progress presents how students perceive the incorporation of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) as content in an advanced Software Engineering (SE) course. This innovation was carried out in a postgraduate course during one semester at a large private university in Chile. The investigation adopted some qualitative, interpretative research using semi-structured interviews. The data was obtained from end-of-term interviews, surveys, and academic records. We focused on academic and professional training, personal evaluation of learning outcomes, utility of the course content and methodology, self-management, desire for learning, self-control, and time spent on core project activities. For this presentation, we concentrated on the analysis of the personal perceptions of utility content and learning. Preliminary results indicate that the incorporation of HCI into the course was highly valued by the students. They all recognized it as a benefit for the software development process. It was also noticed that the activities proposed were good triggers for the self-regulated learning of the expected course content, both SE and HCI. The authors are interested in receiving feedback about the continuity of this work, particularly in the understanding of how the content of HCI interacts with a proposal based on project-based learning (PBL).",Pino L.; Truyol M.; Calderón J.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,Universidad Andrés Bello,
Experiments in the communication lab: Adaptations of the COMM lab model in three institutions,"Across engineering and science disciplines, individual schools and programs are searching for ways to better support science and engineering students as writers and communicators [1] [2] [3]. Despite rich accounts of these interventions, it is difficult to imagine how to implement them in different institutional contexts. In this paper, we analyze the adaptation of one such intervention, the Communication Lab (Comm Lab), a peer-to-peer coaching resource for writing, presenting, and other forms of technical communication [4]. By analyzing three institutions' iterations of a Comm Lab, we argue that a balance between core pedagogical strategies and attention to client needs makes the Comm Lab model both identifiable across institutions and flexible enough to adapt to new institutional contexts. For example, the client-based model relies on using peers with disciplinary expertise to ensure quality feedback. However, the definitions of “peer” and “disciplinary expertise” become more multidisciplinary across institutions according to the student population, the director's background, and the Lab's goals. We first describe three iterations of the Comm Lab: 1) a private research university's consortium of several department-specific Comm Labs, 2) a private research university's centralized Comm Lab for their Division of Science, and 3) an undergraduate-only STEM institution's centralized Comm Lab for students using a multidisciplinary, co-curricular space. We then analyze these adaptations alongside institutional data, client population, and client feedback to articulate three considerations for adapting an educational innovation based on disciplinary and institutional needs: disciplinary breadth, scale, and institutional fit. We conclude by sharing data on the success of the Comm Labs as well as considering the value of cross-institutional collaboration.",Summers S.; Olivier-Mason A.; Dang M.; Chien D.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,Massachusetts Institute of Technology;Rose Hulman Institute Technology;Brandeis University,
"Board 77: Designing, launching and Assessing a multimedia online learning module for library orientation of first year engineering students","A collaboration between the Dibner library and Faculty Innovations in Teaching and Learning (FITL) produced a multimodal asynchronous module to provide incoming students an online library orientation. A partnership with First-year Students & Academic Initiatives provided the opportunity to deliver the module to all incoming students via the university LMS as a mandatory piece in the new student general orientation. Feedback and assessment data are obtained via the built in LMS survey and tracking functions and the use of Bitly to track link usage. Student feedback indicated that the module was well received. The module is adaptable and expandable. A similar workflow can be used to design modules for other platforms and audiences, such as graduate orientation, online classes orientation, employee onboarding, student compliance and advanced research tutorials.",Paul G.; Jean-Pierre Y.; Torres A.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,NYU Tandon School of Engineering;New York University,
An interdisciplinary RET program: Assessment with concerns-based adoption model (RTP),"In 2008, the US National Academy of Engineering (NAE) announced fourteen Grand Challenges in engineering that require solutions in the 21st century. A Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) site at Virginia Tech (VT) is motivated by this Grand Challenge and aims to educate local teachers (and through them their students) about the interdisciplinary aspects of water research to make them aware of water-related issues, and to guide them to develop appropriate solutions to address these challenges. In this work we share details of our RET site and our assessment findings for the first two years of the RET program regarding teacher concerns for adoption of innovative curricular material and their levels of implementation of the activities in their classrooms. We conducted a small survey, focus group, and utilized two instruments from the Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM): the Stages of Concern questionnaire (SoC) and Levels of Use (LoU) interviews, on the first two cohorts of our RET program. Eleven of the teachers thirteen teachers interviewed have implemented in their classes at least once. We did not find a generalizable correlation between creative achievement and level of implementation, but the teacher with the highest creative achievement questionnaire (CAQ) score implemented three projects within the semester immediately following the summer professional development program. The focus group revealed teachers had enthusiasm and gratitude for the summer program overall.",Smith J.; Lohani V.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,Virginia Tech College of Engineering,CBAM ;  Curricular design ;  Innovation adoption ;  Interdisciplinarity ;  Professional development ;  Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) ;  RET ;  Water
Construction and measurement of university-based entrepreneurial ecosystem evaluation index system: A case study of Zhejiang University in China,"The university-based entrepreneurial ecosystem is the cornerstone for sustainable development of academic entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship education. At present, the research on university-based entrepreneurial ecosystem mainly focuses on the concept, while the evaluation of it is still in the initial stage and relatively few. Researchers have realized that the evaluation index system of the university-based entrepreneurial ecosystem should go beyond the specific aspects of economic interests and considering the broader social and economic benefits. However, the links between the evaluation indicators in the existing research are loose, and it is difficult to fully reveal the essence of the ecosystem. And there is no test for operability and feasibility of the indicator system. This paper contributes in several ways to engineering entrepreneurship and innovation. First, the evaluation subjects in current entrepreneurial ecosystem evaluation are mainly regional entrepreneurial ecosystem, student entrepreneurial ecosystem and entrepreneurial ecosystem, and university-based entrepreneurial ecosystem is not included. Secondly, researchers often evaluate the entrepreneurial ecosystem from the internal and external environment or the composition of the ecosystem, without considering the various factors involved in the dynamic process of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. This paper makes a novel contribution by building an evaluation framework of university-based entrepreneurial ecosystem based on its essential characteristics. This paper presents the evaluation system model of university-based entrepreneurial ecosystem, establishing the evaluation indicator system with 4 first-level indicators of ecological diversity, synergistic symbiosis, network interaction and self-evolution, 14 second-level indicators and 33 three-level indicators. And it obtains the index weight on every level with applying the Analytic Hierarchy Process, finding that experts believe network interaction and self-evolution are the two most important measurements of the university-based entrepreneurial ecosystem. Based on this, this paper chooses Zhejiang University as an empirical research case to verify the evaluation index system. The evaluation results show that the overall development of the entrepreneurial ecosystem of Zhejiang University is in good condition, especially in the two aspects of network interaction and self-evolution. Finally, this paper discusses the key points of university-based entrepreneurial ecosystem assessment and possible research directions in the future.",Xie M.; Zhang W.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,Zhejiang University,Evaluation index system ;  Practical application ;  University-based entrepreneurial ecosystem
Analyzing three competency models of advanced manufacturing,"In this research paper, we present a study in which we analyzed and compared three competency models of manufacturing to assess how well the models visually communicate advanced manufacturing (AM) competencies. Advanced manufacturing covers new industrial processes that improve upon traditional methods in quality, speed, and cost. In addition, the dynamic nature of technology and innovation has made it difficult to find a unified illustration of key advanced manufacturing skills. However, three visual models of manufacturing illustrate various stakeholders' perceptions of the field and proport to depict the competencies individuals need to join the AM workforce. The three models we analyzed are: U.S. Department of Labor's Advanced Manufacturing Competency Model, the Society of Manufacturing Engineers' Four Pillars of Manufacturing Knowledge, and the National Association of Manufacturers-endorsed Manufacturing Skills Certification System. While the content in these models has been validated by governmental, industry, and educational stakeholders, less explored is whether these models, as visual media, are readily understandable by their intended audiences. In this paper, we will provide an in-depth analysis of these models by using the six fundamental principles of visual design by Edward Tufte (2006): comparisons, causality, multivariate analysis, integration evidence, documentation, and content. Taken together, these principles allowed us to explore the fundamental principles of design in each model and distill promising directions for further investigation into more unified depiction of the advanced manufacturing industry sector's competencies.",Oh S.; Mardis M.; Jones F.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,Florida State University,
Beyond Likert scales: Exploring designers' perceptions through visual reflection activities,"When it comes to the assessment of design behaviors and outcomes, direct observations by external viewers and subjective reflections by the participants themselves can all yield important information. External viewers, for example, may code video evidence or apply design metrics to a designer's solutions, both of which can lead to interesting statistical analyses and detailed insights. In collecting and analyzing designers' personal reflections and perceptions, researchers often utilize Likert-type scales, multiple choice questions, or short open-ended prompts. While these modes of data collection are useful and valid, they also constrain participants' responses to fixed options in the case of Likert-type scales and multiple-choice questions, and to verbal expressions in the case of open-ended prompts. Few examples of other types of reflection activities (e.g., graphing, sketching) have been presented or studied in the engineering education literature. In this project, which is part of a larger investigation into high performance design teams, we explored the use of graphing and other visual techniques for recording designers' perceptions of their design processes and products. Our primary aim was to introduce greater richness into the evaluation of designers' behaviors and outcomes as we posed research questions about their relationship to cognitive variables. In this paper, we will discuss two of these reflection activities-an emotional state plot and a graphical assessment of a design solution's feasibility, usefulness, and novelty-in the context of a team design challenge. While the designers under study worked as teams, each individual designer provided her/his perceptions of the team process and design solutions using these reflection activities. Our analysis of individual perceptions from seven design teams of 4-5 designers each will be reported here. This investigation also includes the cognitive style of each participant (as measured by Kirton's Adaption-Innovation inventory-KAI®) as a potential mediating variable on the individual perceptions of emotions and outcomes. This paper will provide details of the two reflection activities, our associated methods of analysis, key findings related to the designers' perceptions and cognitive styles, benefits and limitations of these two reflection activities, and implications for design educators.",Jablokow K.; Vora A.; Henderson D.; Bracken J.; Sonalkar N.; Harris S.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2019-06-15,Stanford University;Pennsylvania State University;Community College of the Air Force,
Moving beyond Smart Cities: Digital Nations for Social Innovation & Sustainability,"The next step after smart cities is the creation of digital or smart nations. A digital nation requires a national transformation across diverse institutions including the urban and rural areas of a society. Besides diverse social innovation initiatives, sustainability is a key aspect, so that rather than greenfield projects, long-term solutions will involve brownfield, smart city projects. A digital transformation to a digital or smart nation requires a great deal of innovation in planning, process re-engineering and execution. Whereas research work and policy actions are traditionally focused on a city level, these efforts need to be widened to the national level. Existing city-scale theories and frameworks may be used and adapted to meet the larger-scale needs of the future smart nations. The new issues and research challenges which arise need to be addressed through interdisciplinary approaches. This special issue on the theme of digital nations attempts to address the need in the academic literature to provide a better understanding of digital nations.",Kar A.; Ilavarasan V.; Gupta M.; Janssen M.; Kothari R.,Journal,Information Systems Frontiers,2019-06-15,Ashoka University;Indian Institute of Technology Delhi;Delft University of Technology,Digital nations ;  Implementation barriers ;  Information and communication technology ;  Innovation ;  Smart cities ;  Smart nations ;  Sustainability ;  Technology adoption ;  Technology impact

Cell-Based Fish: A Novel Approach to Seafood Production and an Opportunity for Cellular Agriculture,"Cellular agriculture is defined as the production of agricultural products from cell cultures rather than from whole plants or animals. With growing interest in cellular agriculture as a means to address public health, environmental, and animal welfare challenges of animal agriculture, the concept of producing seafood from fish cell- and tissue-cultures is emerging as an approach to address similar challenges with industrial aquaculture systems and marine capture. Cell-based seafood—as opposed to animal-based seafood—can combine developments in biomedical engineering with modern aquaculture techniques. Biomedical engineering developments such as closed-system bioreactor production of land animal cells create a basis for the large scale production of marine animal cells. Aquaculture techniques such as genetic modification and closed system aquaculture have achieved significant gains in production that can pave the way for innovations in cell-based seafood production. Here, we present the current state of innovation relevant to the development of cell-based seafood across multiple species, as well as specific opportunities and challenges that exist for advancing this science. The authors find that the physiological properties of fish cell- and tissue- culture may be uniquely suited to cultivation in vitro. These physiological properties, including tolerance to hypoxia, high buffering capacity, and low-temperature growth conditions, make marine cell culture an attractive opportunity for scaled production of cell-based seafood; perhaps even more so than mammalian and avian cell cultures for cell-based meats. This opportunity, coupled with the unique capabilities of crustacean tissue-friendly scaffolding such as chitosan, a common seafood waste product and mushroom derivative, presents promise for cell-based seafood production via bioreactor cultivation. To become fully realized, cell-based seafood research will require more understanding of fish muscle cell and tissue cultivation; more investigation into serum-free media formulations optimized for fish cell culture; and bioreactor designs tuned to the needs of fish cells for large scale production.",Rubio N.; Datar I.; Stachura D.; Kaplan D.; Krueger K.,Journal,Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems,2019-06-11,"Tufts School of Engineering;California State University, Chico;City Harvest",aquaculture ;  bioreactor ;  cell-based seafood ;  cellular agriculture ;  fish tissue culture ;  marine cell culture ;  ocean conservation ;  serum-free media

The ministry of education carries the comprehensive layout on the innovation and entrepreneurship education when colleges and universities make the regulations of cultivate virtue and the vocational reform and other top policy documents. The higher education must be adapted to the society development of economy, politics, technology and culture. The relatively complete engineering education system has been established in China in 1950s in accordance with the model of former soviet-union. But in general, it cannot meet the needs of engineering technical personnel with high-quality in the construction market. It starts early and develops rapidly in foreign countries in the aspects of research and practice of innovation and entrepreneurship, which has become more and more mature for colleges and universities in the construction of educational system of innovation and entrepreneurship.

Innovation-driven industrial green development: The moderating role of regional factors,"Industrial green development (IGD) is a critical response to the over-consumption of natural resources and pollution caused by modern industry. Innovation-driven IGD has generated great interest in recent years. However, relatively less attention has been paid to the various aspects of IGD and the moderating role of regional factors, including the developmental stage of IGD, government-scale, and enterprise-scale. The present study was conducted to fill these research gaps using panel data across 30 provinces in China from 2005 to 2015. The empirical results show that 1) innovation does promote IGD and is most effective in low-carbon production, followed by resource reduction, economic operation, and pollution abatement; 2) there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between the regional IGD level and the role of innovation in IGD; and 3) both government-scale and enterprise-scale contribute to the innovation-driven IGD. These findings provide new insights into the impact of innovation on IGD and may shed light on future decisions related to green development.",Li W.; Wang J.; Chen R.; Xi Y.; Liu S.; Wu F.; Masoud M.; Wu X.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2019-06-10,Fuzhou University;National University of Singapore;Queensland University of Technology;Nanyang Technological University,Developmental stage ;  Enterprise-scale ;  Government-scale ;  Industrial green development ;  Innovation
Polymer-based marine antifouling and fouling release surfaces: Strategies for synthesis and modification,"In marine industries, the accumulation of organic matter and marine organisms on ship hulls and instruments limits performance, requiring frequent maintenance and increasing fuel costs. Current coatings technology to combat this biofouling relies heavily on the use of toxic, biocide-containing paints. These pose a serious threat to marine ecosystems, affecting both target and nontarget organisms. Innovation in the design of polymers offers an excellent platform for the development of alternatives, but the creation of a broad-spectrum, nontoxic material still poses quite a hurdle for researchers. Surface chemistry, physical properties, durability, and attachment scheme have been shown to play a vital role in the construction of a successful coating. This review explores why these characteristics are important and how recent research accounts for them in the design and synthesis of new environmentally benign antifouling and fouling release materials.",Leonardi A.; Ober C.,Journal,Annual Review of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering,2019-06-07,Cornell University College of Engineering;Cornell University,AF ;  Antifouling ;  Biofouling ;  Fouling release ;  FR ;  Marine ;  Polymer

From Finnish AEC knowledge ecosystem to business ecosystem: lessons learned from the national deployment of BIM,"Government actors, public agencies, industry and academics have struggled to change the rules of the existing business ecosystem to support the networked practices that were envisioned back in the 1980s with the introduction of building information modelling (BIM). Despite the industry’s far-reaching technological capabilities, BIM has primarily assumed productivity improvement by individual firms, which has not lead to a systemic change in the Finnish architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) business ecosystem. A field study of the Finnish AEC industry has resulted in a critical understanding of why successful and intensive R&D at a national level and wide adoption of BIM technology in Finland has not led to the expected systemic evolution of its AEC business ecosystem. Additionally, a methodology based on inductive grounded theory and historical analysis has been used to capture and identify the evolving and dynamic relationships between various events and actors between 1965 and 2015, which, in turn, has aided in the identification and characterisation of the knowledge and innovation ecosystems. The research findings provide insights for BIM researchers and governments in terms of establishing new policies that will better align BIM adoption with the systemic evolution of business practices in the AEC business ecosystem.",Aksenova G.; Kiviniemi A.; Kocaturk T.; Lejeune A.,Journal,Construction Management and Economics,2019-06-03,École des Sciences de la Gestion;University of Liverpool,Architecture ;  building information modelling ;  building information modelling adoption ;  business ecosystem ;  engineering and construction industry ;  grounded theory ;  policy development
MAKERSPACE FOR SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE INDUSTRY 4.0 ERA,"Goal / Purpose: Universities are increasingly investing in makerspaces. These learning spaces are presented as a place where students can share their projects, can innovate using rapid prototyping equipment, use low and high technology that serves as a starting point for students to launch start-ups, get advice on how to place a product in the market, and relate to potential lenders. This paper aims to discuss whether companies can benefit from these projects and whether skills for engineers can be developed in this environ-ment. The paper provides insightful perceptions of the actions developed by one emer-gent university to develop innovative methodologies to support industry and students, to provide potential partnerships that fund projects in order to better prepare professionals for the industry 4.0. Design / Methodology / Approach: A discussion of the subject was carried out based on the existing literature and an exploratory study in an existing makerspace in the Nether-lands. It was one qualitative research based on a case study. Field observation and research questions were based on the technical skills of engineering described in theory. Results: This article presented the idea that the makerspaces can be a great source of innovation if they are appropriately designed. The connection between universities and companies, aligned to active methodologies for teaching and learning meets a global need within a corporate universe to get faster and simpler and make the team see the project in a more holistic and complete manner. However, the goal is to bridge the gap with pro-fessors, researchers, makers, start-ups, and companies who want to use business-to-busi-ness practices. It can be said that these are beneficial characteristics of a makerspace observed: (i) students’ learning is more active, (ii) more interaction between students and professors, through different areas (iii) at an early stage, students get in contact with the professional reality of their field, as the projects are related to real Engineering problems, and (iv) students develop transversal skills. Practical implications: This paper identifies the potential that Makerspaces offer as a strategic approach to teaching and learning related to the fourth industrial era. This paper implies that universities and academics that wish to tailor their education to industry 4.0 need understand this model better, and where appropriate invest in educational infra-structures such as this in universities, companies or cities. This will ensure that universities are educating professionals with the most suitable skills for industry and society, generat-ing innovation in creative teaching and learning spaces.

RESHAPING ENGINEERING LEARNING TO PROMOTE INNOVATIVE ENTREPRENEURIAL BEHAVIOR,"Goal: To foster innovative and creative thinking in the curricula of Engineering schools, as well as other technology-based courses, contributing to the innovation ecosystems’ growth and sustainability. Design/Methodology/Approach: The research was structured as an exploratory research and was conducted by means of a focus group comprised of representatives from Porto Alegre (RS) working directly with higher education and/or playing key roles within the city’s innovation ecosystem. The group’s discussion was analyzed along with current literature on the topic. Results: The paper provides insightful perceptions of the obstacles faced by faculty mem-bers when attempting to develop innovative methodologies within classes so that potential partnerships are fostered by agents of the innovation ecosystem in order to better prepare professionals that will later be inserted in this new innovative scenario. Limitations of the investigation: The present study is structured as an exploratory research based on a focus group discussion and analysis. Thus, as any qualitative approach, it might lack generalizability, once its purpose is to investigate a specific phenomenon and promote further investigation on the issue. However, all discussion from the focus group was analyzed and supported by extant literature on the topic, in order to mitigate such limitation and strengthen the research relevance. Practical implications: The analysis and discussion obtained from both the focus group and literature are imperative on the need of critical changes on universities’ organizational culture to support entrepreneurial activities, as well as fostering partnerships with key agents within innovation ecosystems to better prepare professionals to the new market setting. Originality/value: Although some studies investigate the relationship involving universities and Science and Technology Parks, few studies explore how engineering schools’ curricula can benefit from such alliances.

Uctm—an ambidextrous service innovation framework—a bottom-up approach to combine human-and technology-centered service design,"Digital innovation is a key success factor for business enterprises and organizations concerned with public safety. Increasingly shorter technology cycles produce a stream of highly promising gadgets and smart devices and this innovative provision opens a gap between what is currently in use for the value-creation processes of an organization and what could potentially be used. The presented framework provides guidance on how to implement dynamic capabilities needed for business model and service innovation within a complex socio-technical system. A way to combine technology and use-case sensing with the ultimate aim of creating innovative artifacts for organizations is presented. While Business Model Innovation (BMI) literature mainly focuses on a strategic top-down process, we propose a bottom-up process-driven approach to complement business frameworks. Based on these insights, new service artifacts can be designed and analyzed in a systemic way. The applied research methodology is based on the design science research concept. A qualitative approach with focus groups was used to gather user requirements and facilitate participatory and user-centered design of information systems. In this paper, we provide a framework that supports business executives as well as IT experts on how to cope with and integrate new technologies into organizations, their processes, and their business models. In addition to a comprehensive theoretical overview of the proposed framework, we also provide practical results, since this framework was applied in the course of a service design and engineering research project. A use case of alpine rescue missions serves as an example to demonstrate the practical application of the proposed framework.",Vorraber W.; Neubacher D.; Moesl B.; Brugger J.; Stadlmeier S.; Voessner S.,Journal,Systems,2019-06-01,Johannes Kepler University Linz;Technische Universitat Graz,Digital innovation ;  Information systems ;  Socio-technical systems ;  Systems engineering

Using technology to enhance learning and engagement in engineering,"In this article, we explore how information, communications, and computational technology, or computer technology for short, influences the way that engineering is taught and learned. The goal of our analysis it to contribute towards a research, adoption, and policy agenda for propagating the effective use of computer technology in engineering education and for avoiding pitfalls associated with the connectivity that this technology enables. We seek to inform action and generate conversation amongst instructors, students, researchers, administrators, policy makers, and other key stakeholders in engineering education. We organize our discussion through six main issues as the focus for systemic change for the effective integration of technology in engineering education. These issues were identified through a Delphi study with a group of engineering education experts. Our analysis of the issues then draws on major policy reports of the use of technology in education and the extant research literature from engineering education and science education as well as technology studies and science studies. Discussion of each of these issues leads to a summary set of recommendations. Specifically, we address the role of technology in learning engineering, including both technologies developed specifically for learning engineering (learning innovations) and domain-specific computer technologies for engineering practice (computational tools). We next address technology-related issues around instructional design including learning outcomes, assessment, and instructional practice. We include discussion of professional development that better prepares faculty to effectively use technology in the classroom. Finally, we outline the broader ways technology interacts with the work of engineering students and faculty at the systems level-for better and for worse.",Koretsky M.; Magana A.,Journal,Advances in Engineering Education,2019-06-01,Oregon State University;Purdue University,Assessment ;  Computer technology ;  Educational innovations ;  Engineering practice ;  Faculty professional development ;  Instructional design

Exploring technology and engineering management research landscape,"This study set out to explore the basic features of the field by using scientific articles in the field of Technology and Engineering Management (TEM). In this context, publication data indexed in Web of Science (WoS) were used. The obtained data were recorded in the relational database and prepared for analysis. In the analysis of the data, the R programming language, the CiteSpace and the Ggplot2 library were used. Social Network Analysis (SNA) and Bibliometric were used as methods. Accordingly, the longest-running journal in the field is IEEE-TEM. We identified 6 basic clusters in TEM studies; Open innovation, management practices, bibliometric analysis, corporate opinion, academic success creation and health technology literature.

Openness in intellectual property strategies of synthetic biology start-ups,"The concept of Intellectual Property (IP) strategies has a growing importance for technology-based firms in recent years, which includes open IP strategies such as permissive licensing making IP free for others to use or choosing not to protect IP at all. At the same time, the question of how IP should be used as an asset to promote innovation and protect the economic return for firms has been debated across various emerging industries. This study aims to understand the current IP strategies of synthetic biology start-ups and their willingness to open up IP in the future. A conceptual framework of ranking different IP strategies and the concept of Willingness to Open are first proposed. Then, qualitative data is collected from eight synthetic biology case studies in the UK. The companies' IP strategies are divided into in-bound and outbound, and ranked within the conceptual framework. The motivations and impacts of these IP strategies are analysed and discussed. Finally, each company's willingness to open up their IP in the future is ranked from high to low, alongside their reasonings. These analyses have proven the value of this exploratory work, however more studies are required to clarify the current findings and broaden the research.",Tang A.; Tietze F.; Molloy J.,Conference Proceeding,"2019 IEEE Technology and Engineering Management Conference, TEMSCON 2019",2019-06-01,University of Cambridge,Intellectual Property Strategy ;  Openness ;  Synthetic Biology
Modular Flexible Test Bed for Intelligent and Connected Transportation System,"To provide a reference for the design and construction of an intelligent and connected transportation system, this paper reviews the status of testing technology in existing research. Combining the experience of testing and research on connected and autonomous vehicle test-sites at Chang'an University, this paper proposes a modular flexible test bed for an intelligent and connected transportation system. The modular flexible test bed included an application layer, a sensing and releasing layer, a network link layer, and a management service layer. The application layer simulated a real-world intelligent connected environment. The adaption of devices and services in different environments for intelligent connected transportation can be verified by simulating various aspects of weather, roads, and traffic conditions. The sensing and releasing layer collected information of the environment and traffic system and released control and service information, through sensing devices including a camera, light detection and ranging (lidar) device, and millimeter-wave radar, and releasing devices including a variable information board. The network link layer consisted of a heterogeneous vehicular network. Through collaboration among networks, the network link layer could provide transparent transmission and exclusive network information services for devices and services in the application and sensing and releasing layers. The management service layer managed storage, backup, processing, and visualization of the lower layers' data, and implemented the management and maintenance of the lower layers' test devices. Based on the modular test bed mentioned above, an in-door test bench for an intelligent and connected vehicle was developed to cooperate with the test bed for simulating, recreating, and adjusting a traffic scene, so as to realize a flexible intelligent and connected transportation test. The modular flexible test bed for an intelligent and connected transportation system proposed in this paper has a standardized test environment and uses a controllable and traceable test process and scientific test evaluation method. It can verify intelligent and connected devices and services on functionality, application processing, application effects, and service utility, in different dimensions. The construction, promotion, and application of the modular flexible test bed for intelligent and connected transportation systems can promote the transformation of intelligent and connected technology from theoretical research to practical application and will play a crucial role in achieving innovation and reform of future transportation information services and transportation systems.",Li X.; Zhao X.; Xu Z.; Wang R.; Wang W.,Journal,Zhongguo Gonglu Xuebao/China Journal of Highway and Transport,2019-06-01,Chang'an University,Automotive engineering ;  Heterogeneous network ;  Intelligent and connected transportation ;  Intelligent transportation system ;  Unmanned driving ;  Vehicular network

Open Innovation in Customer Experience of Mass-Catering Service,"Literature suggests that it is of value for organisations to receive customer feedback to stay competitive in the marketplace. Feedback may be used to improve existing and to develop new products and services. Customer experience is considered as one of the main focal areas of the innovation process. This paper presents a study on the customer experience of a mass-catering service company. An inductive research approach was adopted to explore the attitudes of the customers towards the service and the customers' improvement ideas regarding the service. The primary qualitative data of roughly 200 interviews were collected with semi-structured interviews by approximately 50 interviewers throughout 2018. The generic research questions were operationalised by six interview questions. The respondents were found to have complex and sometimes contradicting views regarding the service. Gender and occupation were found to have an impact on the responses. Four general categories were identified according to which attitudes and improvement ideas could be captured and analysed: Food, service, place and price. These categories were found to have relationships with each other.",Maslov I.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2019",2019-06-01,Jyväskylän ammattikorkeakoulu,customer experience ;  customer feedback ;  open innovation ;  semi-structured interviews
Conceptualising innovation platforms through innovation ecosystems perspective,"Innovation ecosystems are built around a central node which can be an innovation platform. An innovation platform is a space of interaction for stakeholders to interact and develop innovations in a collective manner. Analysis of innovation platforms has been mainly through value chain and innovation system perspectives. However innovation ecosystems perspective offers great insights on how innovations can be co-created. This study develops a framework for innovation platforms from the innovation ecosystem perspective. The study used multi-disciplinary literature on innovation ecosystems and innovation platforms.From ecosystem perspective formation of ecosystems can be sub divided between scoping and planning. Scoping phase has been found to consist of strategic policies definition and ecosystem strategic analysis activities. Planning phase activities include ecosystem design, ecosystem preparedness, recruiting actors and providing physical infrastructure. Functioning activities for co-creation can be coordinated by a strategy with five stages namely product development, product manufacturing, market formation management, value appropriation and feedback generation. This paper outlines a framework that can be used by innovation ecosystem facilitators to evaluate their platforms and develop management tools for their specific contexts.",Dondofema R.; Grobbelaar S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2019",2019-06-01,Stellenbosch University,innovation ecosystem ;  innovation platforms ;  value co-creation
Innovation Maturity Model for New Product and Services Development: A proposal,"Innovation is currently identified as the main source of competitive advantage and it is essential for a company to be able to manage and recognize innovative processes. However, especially with regard to small and medium-sized enterprises, the choices made in the field of innovation management are still based on the intuition of the individual manager, although there are different approaches and tools that can help company managers to the purpose. Relying on existing literature on the topic and comparing the different approaches to new product development, this study proposes a novel innovation maturity model that allows small companies to assess their innovation management procedures and to identify potential improvements towards an increased competitive position. The maturity model exploits the analytic hierarchy process technique to allow a quantitative comparison between the different dimensions and sub-dimensions describing the strategic and operative position of a responding company. This allows to tune and personalize the provided feedback considering market, sector and company specificities. Performed tests with real users allowed to achieve a preliminary validation of the approach.",Mattei G.; Canetta L.; Sorlini M.; Alberton S.; Tito F.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2019",2019-06-01,Scuola Universitaria Professionale della Svizzera Italiana,Analytic Hierarchy Process ;  innovation management ;  maturity model ;  New Product Development
Innovation Acceptability in Elderly Care: A Risk Evaluation Approach,"The increase of the senior population requires multiple efforts to maintain the best quality of life by controlling risks and expenses. This situation has been the driving force behind the development of many innovations in the elderly care. However, the success of these innovations depends on their acceptability. After a bibliometric study, we propose that the innovation acceptability is conditioned by the different preferences and multiple risks incurred by a group of stakeholders. This article focuses on the development of a global model for assessing and reducing the fall risk of seniors. This risk is studied in the context of innovations for home care.",Acosta-Salgado L.; Rakotondranaivo A.; Bonjour E.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2019",2019-06-01,ERPI (Équipe de Recherche sur les Processus Innovatifs),acceptability ;  Elderly person ;  healthcare innovation ;  risk factors
The role teams and organizational factors play in disruptive innovations in ambidextrous organizations,"One of the biggest challenges that large companies challenge at commercializing innovations is how to successfully transfer the project to the business unit at the moment of scaling up the innovation. This research has deployed multiple case methodology to study the process of transference of twelve disruptive innovations in ambidextrous organizations to improve the understanding of how corporate ventures face the transition from a disruptive innovation to a receiving business unit. The study identifies different crucial team activities within the process of transferring the projects to the receiving business units as well as key organizational factors between the RD team, the business unit and the corporation, as it follows: 1) the achievement of first sales and running of pilot projects, 2) early-relations with the potential receiving business unit, 3) misfit between the innovation project and the business unit, 4) transfer of the R D team to the receiving team, 5) presence of champions and project support network. The research also provides insights about the most appropriate time for the realization of the transfer.",Cubero J.; Consolacion Segura C.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2019",2019-06-01,Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona;Universitat Politécnica de Catalunya,ambidexterity ;  commercializing technology ;  corporate venturing ;  disruptive innovations ;  intrapreneurship. ;  radical innovations ;  transition management
Developing private innovation scoreboard and its application in South Korea,"The private sector is considered as a core driver of national innovation activities. From the perspective of national innovation system, it is the key sub-system in which various innovation activities are triggered by profit maximization motives. Currently, in South Korea, the research and development (RD) investment in private sector accounts for about 75% of the national RD investment. Considering the increasing role of the private sector in the national innovation system, it is essential for policy makers to make innovation activities in each domain to be complementary with each other. From the perspective of the national innovation system the primary objective of this study is to develop the innovation scoreboard that enables us to monitor the status of the innovation activities in private sector. Furthermore, we seek to ensure the comparability of all indicators so that we can easily identify one nation's area of relative strength and comparative advantage.The private sector innovation scoreboard is composed of four sub-categories: Innovation infrastructure, institutions, innovation activities and impact. The innovation activities are divided further onto knowledge activities, organizational activities and innovation output. By doing so, the part of innovation activities model the sequential process of input-output flow of innovation. In total, 60 indicators are included in the private innovation scoreboard.Among the 60 indicators, South Korea has relative strength in science and technology human resources, market size, private RD support system, start-up system, and the number of start-ups. However, it shows relative weakness in indicators such as financial infrastructure, legal system for promoting science and technology, financial system, labor market efficiency, regulation and output. Scores on science and technology manpower, start-ups, and input into knowledge activities, which can be regarded as input, were relatively good. However, the output and impact sectors of innovation, which can be considered as performance areas, seem relatively vulnerable. Compared to input, the causes of low performance can be explained with lack of financial infrastructure, financial and scientific technology promotion system, and industry-academic cooperation.By creating a private innovation scoreboard this study contributes to the understanding of current status of overall private sector innovation system in Korea. Therefore, we can compare the current South Korea system with that of advanced countries and identify its strengths and weaknesses. As a result, we can contribute to the development of strategic policymaking, such as the supplementation of relatively vulnerable areas.",Ko Y.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2019",2019-06-01,Korea Institute of S&T Evaluation and Planning,national innovation system ;  private innovation scoreboard ;  RD policy ;  ST indicators
Comparative Analysis of Innovation Capability: Examining Across Career Strata and Gender using Item Response Theory Approach.,"In view of increasing diversity in all sectors, and the growing connectivity and liberalization of most global economies, this paper seeks to analyze the effects on innovation as a firm transitions from predominantly male to a more equal distribution of genders across the main sectors of responsibility in an enterprise. Moreover, this paper uses psychometric tools and techniques to validate the Berkeley Innovation Index (BII) which is a tool used to measure innovation capabilities of individuals in an organization. Lastly, this paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the importance of gender diversity, particularly in top management positions, both by literature review and by showing statistically that notions of the superiority of male managers is a missguided bias with potentially severe consequences in the areas of risk, access to emerging markets, and product and process innovation, to name a few.",Bathia S.; Castro-Hernandez E.; Goyal M.; Ojala A.; Sidhu I.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2019",2019-06-01,UC Berkeley’s Industrial Engineering and Operations Research Department,gender diversity ;  innovation capability ;  intrapreneurship ;  item response theory ;  management
Scaling-up collaborative practices through mobile technology,"The beginning of the 21st century is experiencing the advent of smart technologies, which are redefining a new space and time. Consequently, we are more and more witnessing emerging companies, which have partially dematerialised and deterritorialised their knowledge, and where collaboration happens in a space in-between.This paper proposes to examine digital technologies, more specifically mobile technology with regards to the reorganisation of work and innovation in creative industries. The aim of this paper is to shed light on Nonaka and Konno's concept of ba (1998) in relation to the new digital paradigm. Our key intention is to investigate how can mobile technology foster a co-creative space between people and processes.Using a broad literature, and a qualitative approach, we will examine how mobile technology, beyond just being a tool, enables a freshened consideration of the concept of ba, a new form of organisation of creative work.",Antonczak L.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2019",2019-06-01,Université de Strasbourg,Co-creation ;  creativity ;  innovation ;  mobile technology ;  organisation
The Link between Innovation and Export: Evidences from small-sized firms practices,"Numerous publications try to identify and test empirically the link between innovation and export to explain firms' competitiveness. If several ways of thinking coexist without a real consensus, this article proposes a different approach, by considering innovation and export as two complementary activities mobilizing common practices within companies. With a special focus on small-sized companies, this article aims to identify evidences from the ground to explore the synergies between innovation and exportation activities. This research work is based on a methodological approach combining an explorative analysis of the literature, leading to the proposition of a specific theoretical framework as well as an empirical analysis putting forward evidences from small-sized firms' practices. Relying on a set of joint innovation and export practices from our reference framework, we present a cross-case analysis among 11 different innovative and exporting French SMEs in order to identify how the synergistic effect between innovation and export can be shaped.",Enjolras M.; Camargo M.; Boly V.; Schmitt C.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2019",2019-06-01,Centre Européen de Recherche en Economie Financière et en Gestion des Entreprises (CEREFIGE);ERPI (Équipe de Recherche sur les Processus Innovatifs),Cross-cases Analysis ;  Export ;  Firms Practices ;  Innovation ;  SMEs

Comparing Different Performance Factors of Conventional VS Immersive Service Prototypes,"Service prototyping is an innovative iterative process envisioned to enhance the service development process while refining the anticipated service experience. Immersive technologies, such as: Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR), in service prototyping have the potential to enhancing the co-creation of service ideas. It is intended to transform intangible service aspects into an experience, even before the service exists. However, there is a lack of research studies comparing different forms of service prototype. Such studies would help to find out the most appropriate Service Prototype (SP) form for exploring, communicating and evaluating new service ideas. Several SP experiment sessions were conducted in France and Germany within an academic context in 2018 to compare different performance factors of conventional Service Prototypes (CSP) versus Immersive Service Prototypes (ISP). The participants have to disassemble and then reassemble a simple three-part mechanical element with the aid of four different SP forms. This paper presents the results of the experiment sessions, involving 38 participants, conducted at Furtwangen University campus in Germany. These results reveal that participants preferred ISP forms rather than CSP forms. However, it also confirms that there are still some difficulties in applying and using VR or AR devices.",Abdel Razek A.; Van Husen C.; Pallot M.; Richir S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2019",2019-06-01,Arts et Metiers Institute of Technology;Hochschule Furtwangen,Augmented Reality ;  Mixed Reality ;  Service Experience ;  Service Innovation ;  Service Prototyping ;  User eXperience ;  Virtual Reality
The purchase of innovative components as an open innovation practice: Redefining the boundaries between closed and open innovation,"The aim of the paper is to refresh the open innovation paradigm, extending it beyond its traditional practices by including the purchase of innovative components. Indeed, when OEMs acquire components, they incorporate an innovative effort made by their suppliers that contributes to the improvement of the overall innovation level of the final product. A mapping of buyer-supplier relationships is suggested to allow compatibility between the open innovation paradigm and the purchase of innovative components emerge. A comparison between the purchase of innovative components and the traditional open innovation practices will confirm the real compatibility. The common elements among open innovation practices are the partner's contribution to the overall R&D effort necessary for product development and the value added to the final product resulting from the involvement of third parties. Both elements are detected in the purchase of innovative components, confirming the theoretical hypotheses. Two opposite theoretical consequences derive from the work. On the one hand, the open innovation paradigm is extended to other buyer-supplier relationships, redefining the boundaries between closed and open innovation. On the other hand, scholars have to wonder if closed innovation may occur at all, at least in R&D intense industries.",Cammarano A.; Michelino F.; Caputo M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2019",2019-06-01,Università degli Studi di Salerno,black-box integration ;  buyer-supplier relationships ;  component innovation ;  modularization ;  Open innovation ;  purchase of components
Collaborative Engineering - Main features and challenges of cross-company collaboration in engineering of products and services,"Though methodologies will change engineering, it will stay crucial for the economic success of products and services. However, the success criteria are changing increasingly. Not only the price, quality and functionality are key factors, rather the prerequisites for future business models are increasingly being created by providing accompanying services and novel possibilities for product enhancement. Strictly speaking, engineering has to prepare the basics for such business models.In a forecast study on behalf of the German Ministry of Economics the authors asked for trends, opportunities and challenges in future engineering. Based on literature analysis and expert interviews success factors and upcoming trends were identified. Collaborative work was identified as a key element in future engineering. Collaboration currently exists widely in the field of research and development, i.e. in the more pre-competitive field. This is often described by the keyword open innovation. The model of collaboration is aligned with equality. Regional innovation clusters provide e.g. such an ecosystem geared towards equality and long-term strategic cooperation, which has proven economically successful in recent decades. Bringing all these methodologies together - engineering accompanying the whole life cycle, collaboration along the value-added chain, and new information-driven business models - this results in a new culture of cross-company collaborative engineering as a key enabler.It turned out that it is still too early for a detailed strategic roadmap for the concrete implementation of cross-company collaborative engineering. Nevertheless, the status quo and foreseeable steps to create the precondition for successful cross-company collaborative engineering can be well described. Thus, the extended digital twin becomes the key element of success for the widespread use of cross-company collaborative engineering. The digital twin will only be able to fulfil its key function as a virtual image for the engineering by means of an extension in order to bring together all the levels and not only the technical ones.",Kuenzel M.; Kraus T.; Straub S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2019",2019-06-01,Verein Deutscher Ingenieure,business model ;  collaboration ;  cross-company ;  engineering ;  enhanced digital twin ;  labor organization ;  law
Investigating the relationships between health and innovation systems to guide innovation adoption,"Without good implementation practices, health research and health innovations do not readily translate to enhanced health outcomes. The literature on technology management and healthcare has shown that, despite the numerous resources that are expended on creating innovative healthcare solutions, the management of the innovative technologies often results in these solutions not being implemented into the healthcare system where and when they are needed. In this paper, the complex interactions and relationships between a system of innovation and a healthcare system are uncovered, in the context of low- and middle-income (resource constrained) countries. Specifically, this paper investigates how the relationship between these two systems contribute to the successful adoption of technological innovations into the healthcare system.This paper contributes to knowledge on the management and improvement of healthcare innovation adoption in low- and middle- income countries. The research promotes greater access to healthcare innovations in attempts to encourage health equity and to improve the performance of countries' health systems.",Leonard E.; De Kock I.; Bam W.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2019",2019-06-01,Stellenbosch University,Health system ;  health technology management ;  health technology transfer ;  implementation science ;  innovation system
"On the Extension of Digital Ecosystems for SCM and Customs with Distributed Ledger Technologies : Requirements Anlysis, Innovation Assessment, and Prototype Design for the Lake Constance Region","Global supply chains represent the backbone of the modern manufacturing industry. Planning of global supply chains still represents a major hurdle, mainly because of the high complexity and unforeseen disruptions that have to be mastered for meeting the different logistics windows in a globally distributed production environment. Trust in supply chains is an additional challenge. A major - albeit sometimes overlooked - part of Supply Chain Management (SCM) is the management and integration of customs processes, clearing of tariffs, (re-)billing of customers, and fulfilling other legal requirements related to crossing borders, ranging from environmental standards over goods inspection to general paper work. With the exception of work offered by the World Customs Organization (WCO) the issue of customs and blockchain is still underrepresented in research and practice. In this paper, we look at innovations that drive the current ICT-enabled SCM research and how these can be combined with smart customs management. After a literature review and introduction to the state-of- The-art, we list potential trust-based innovations for SCM and customs in digital business ecosystems. Based upon the innovations we also describe a requirements analysis of existing distributed ledger technologies (requirements for system layout, system configuration, system governance). A description of the prototype for the Lake Constance region - on which we are currently working - concludes the paper.",Dobler M.; Ballandies M.; Holzwarth V.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2019",2019-06-01,Universität Liechtenstein;ETH Zürich;FHV - Vorarlberg University of Applied Sciences,Blockchain ;  Customs ;  Digital Business Ecosystems ;  Digital Ecosystems ;  Supply Chain Management
From Program Strategic Planning to Program Initiation: Lessons learned from a collaborative University-Industry RD case study,"This paper aims to contribute to knowledge by presenting the lessons learned resultant from a large case study composed by three collaborative University-Industry RD funded programs between the University of Minho (UMinho) and Bosch Car Multimedia Portugal (Bosch). The three programs selected amount to a total investment of above €109 million, over the period between 2013 and 2021, involving more than one thousand University researchers and Industry collaborators. The lessons learned are limited to the time span from Program Strategic Planning, where new project ideas/innovation opportunities are identified and developed for the preparation of the 'Funding Application', to Program Initiation, where the program effectively initiates after the negotiation of the 'Funding Contract'. The collection, analysis and implementation of lessons learned allowed the development of a structured process to guide University-Industry partners on the path to transform some newly identified project ideas into the initiation of a large RD funded program. The proposed process is currently adopted by the governance structure of Bosch and UMinho partnership and other UMinho partnerships with Industry.",Fernandes G.; Silva D.; Magalhaes P.; Pinto E.; Araujo M.; Machado R.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2019",2019-06-01,Universidade do Minho,lessons learned ;  Program and project management ;  University-Industry collaboration
Alignment of Technology Management Strategy and Business Strategy: A case study,"The knowledge era has changed business' approaches towards strategy planning and implementation. Research has been done in the alignment of technology strategies with business strategies, albeit up to certain levels in large organisations, in certain continents and countries and in certain industries. The objective of this research is to evaluate whether Technology Management tools and methods are generally utilised in the mining supply industry, as well as whether these tools and methods are aligned with business strategies for future planning. A case study was undertaken of a company that is a developer and manufacturer of high quality, application-specific process equipment and solutions, with its main client stated as the mining industry. Results indicates that TM tools are not utilised on a very formal basis. The influence of TM tools' usage on future technology strategy planning is mostly described by the term 'informally influenced'. A well balanced alignment between the TM tools and methods with the business strategy elements are reported. Respondents are aware of the importance of technology and the need to have a more formal technology strategy. The effect on future alignment choices showed a focus that remained on innovations, but leaning more towards sustainability. Limitations were noted and further research recommendations proposed.",Herbst T.; Pretorius M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2019",2019-06-01,University of Pretoria,Alignment ;  Business strategy ;  Technology Management strategy
Technology executives in the sixth RD generation context: New ways to organisational innovativeness via 'expeditionary' leadership,"This article is focused on the technology management issues and covers the following core topics: Leadership in the technology-related organizations, technology executives' - and especially, Chief Technology Officers'- functionality, open versus close innovations and innovation support. In this paper, the authors attempt to analyze the changing conditions of the current technology management processes associated with the accelerating dynamics of organizational transformations, strengthening boundaries of cross-disciplinary technologies application and generally increased the speed of the advanced technologies development. Such drastic changes obviously affect the way and manner of the modern management processes implementation. Nowadays each company - to a more or less extent - is a technology-driven organization. Digitization, cyber-physical systems and artificial intelligence are the key drivers for the changing business circumstances. Consequently, management and technology today are so intertwined that without a holistic and conceptual understanding of the core principles of this interdisciplinary tandem it is just not possible to be at the crest of the 'business success wave'. Overall, the socio-economical effect of the increasingly complex technologies obviously requires new forms of management and leadership so as new - appropriate and workable in the actual conditions - management tools. In terms of the technology executives' professional functionality, it is important also to pay attention to the 'back effect' of the aforementioned technological impact. On the one hand, technology executives are increasingly appointed as members of the top management team (TMT). But on the other hand, it means that they should be understood by specialists from different non-directly related to technologies areas (i.e. financiers, strategists, business process managers, etc.). In other words, in order to bring the technological perspective in the general management process and further have a sustainable managerial impact on the internal and external stakeholders, technology executives should also be leaders with abilities to recognize how applied technologies are perceived from other perspectives of organizational functioning. In this context, modern technology executives should perform the role of 'boundary spanners' by means of establishing informational and managerial links among different groups and persons at the intra- and extra-organizational levels. Thus, integrating different facets of technology perception from the core stakeholders and directly or indirectly maintaining coordination of their activities, technology executives could increasingly act as agents of organizational change and innovations promotion.",Lohmuller B.; Petrikhin A.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2019",2019-06-01,Steinbeis-Hochschule-Berlin,closed-open and focused-social innovations ;  CTO ;  expeditionary leadership ;  Hidden CTO ;  organizational innovations ;  primary team leadership ;  RD generations ;  Technology management
Patterns of Digitization - What differentiates digitally mature organizations?,"This article describes the results of a survey designed to assess how companies are implementing digital transformation, including the various strategies they employ and the actions they take to achieve large-scale transformations. While a few companies seem to reach front-runner status, the majority seem to lag behind. This phenomenon is a top concern of boardrooms worldwide and motivated the development of this study. To help these organizations, we highlight differentiated strategic principles and characteristics of the companies' design processes digitally mature companies undertake to transform their businesses. These insights should help lagging companies understand what is involved in implementing a digital transformation and what they need to do to enforce this transformation.",Gudergan G.; Mugge P.; Kwiatkowski A.; Abbu H.; Michaelis T.; Krechting D.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2019",2019-06-01,Poole College of Management;Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen;VP/GM Analytics Practice,Business Model ;  Change Management ;  Corporate Culture ;  Digital Transformation ;  Innovation Management
A collaborative tool to design the product/supply chain couple in a high-tech environment: Application to an electromagnetic sensor,"The emergence of innovative products involves several stakeholders and impacts the supply chain. Innovation is often a collective and open process. As the product is interlinked with its supply chain, companies involved in the innovation process have a strong interest in focusing on the product/supply chain pair rather than on the product alone. However, there are many collaborative tools dedicated to product design but they are not necessarily adapted to the design of the product/supply chain couple. Therefore, we suggest in this article that an instantiated supply chain model can help companies collaborate to design their product/supply chain couple. A case study illustrates our proposal and highlights the importance of digital tools in the innovation process.",Marche B.; Boly V.; Mayer F.; Ortt J.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2019",2019-06-01,"ERPI (Équipe de Recherche sur les Processus Innovatifs);Faculteit Techniek, Bestuur en Management, TU Delft",Case Study ;  Collaborative tools ;  Innovation ;  Supply chain
Towards an effective management of corporate entrepreneurship activities,"Corporate entrepreneurship (CE) is experiencing continuously increasing interest from scholars and practitioners. One reason for this seems to be rooted in the organizational structures of established companies, which are cumbersome for implementing organizational agility and for developing radical innovations. In view of the advancing digitalization, however, exactly this is required in order to be successful in the long-term. CE is a promising managerial tool that offers a wide range of options to pursue the creation of new businesses and to support the companies' transformation in order to adapt to changes in the environment. Even though CE offers a broad range of opportunities, the effective management is a challenge. One reason for this is the ambiguity when it comes to the differences between the various CE forms and the objectives that can be achieved by those. This study, which is based on 13 in-depth interviews from eight high-tech companies, contributes to a better understanding of CE by offering a first harmonized set of CE objectives that is suitable to compare and differentiate across the different forms. In addition to that, three CE types, offering a new perspective on how to differentiate CE forms, are identified and give implications for a more effective management.",Selig C.; Baltes G.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2019",2019-06-01,Hochschule Konstanz University of Applied Sciences,corporate entrepreneurship ;  corporate venturing ;  discontinuous innovation ;  dynamic capabilities ;  objectives ;  organizational transformation ;  strategic entrepreneurship
Entrepreneurial Employees: A Review and Future Research Agenda,"Volatile markets and accelerating innovation cycles progressively force established companies to adopt alternative innovation strategies such as entrepreneurship. Due to the key role entrepreneurial employees play for strengthening the company's abilities for innovation and change, various concepts have emerged like corporate entrepreneurship or intrapreneurship. While the extant literature has increasingly examined only specific issues of entrepreneurial employees, an overall view on it lacks investigation. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to structurally present current research on entrepreneurial employees by conducting a broad systematic literature review. The resulting research streams contribute to a clearer justification for future research and are a first step towards a comprehensive research view related to intrapreneurship.",Lang C.; Baltes G.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2019",2019-06-01,Hochschule Konstanz University of Applied Sciences,comprehensive view ;  entrepreneurial employees ;  future research ;  literature review
The preliminary validation of practices of engagement in innovation platforms: Towards understanding innovation platforms in healthcare,"Innovation platforms (IPs) are significant drivers of innovation and change. By including diverse stakeholders as platform participants, IPs have the potential to address the challenges of the healthcare systems of developing countries while simultaneously empowering their participants. Forming part of ongoing research into healthcare IPs, the paper establishes the completeness and accuracy of Practices of Engagement (PoE) concepts by investigating how the concepts apply to a case study. The case of the Safe Water and AIDS Project (SWAP), a social innovation in healthcare initiative in Kenya, is considered. Using the innovation platform lens, the different stakeholders involved are identified and the interactions between them are investigated. It was found that the PoE concepts successfully describe these stakeholder interactions. The research contribution lies in identifying concepts to guide the IP stakeholders in their responsibility to interact with other stakeholders in a constructive manner towards achieving the platform's goals.",Edlmann F.; Grobbelaar S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2019",2019-06-01,Stellenbosch University,Developing country ;  Healthcare ;  Innovation platform ;  Practices of engagement ;  Safe Water and AIDS Project (SWAP)

Constellation of Innovation Laboratories: A Scientific Outlook,"Digital transformation and technology democratization are demanding new organisational structures led by trust, transparency and openness. For some years now, innovation laboratories have been embraced as unique and enabling environments acting as facilitators for the evolution of our communities, business and territories. However, as they are being embodied under different names and shaped by their context, they also seem to operate freely under multiple-related innovation approaches. This is leading to a grey-zone within the universe of innovation laboratories, making them difficult to study and manage. In this paper, Innovation laboratories are studied as innovation intermediaries that fulfil the purpose of creating communities of knowledge imbued with values of sharing and collaborating towards a common objective or project. Through a bibliometric study, a scientific outlook for the constellation of Innovation laboratories is built. Research affinities and distinctions between the most common concepts often related to these innovation intermediaries are discussed. And lastly, the grounds for a research agenda on the strategic management and assessment of this phenomenon are set.",Osorio F.; Dupont L.; Camargo M.; Pena J.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2019",2019-06-01,ERPI (Équipe de Recherche sur les Processus Innovatifs);Universidad Nacional de Colombia,bibliometric analysis ;  innovation intermediaries ;  innovation labs ;  strategic management
In Search of Synergies between Corporate Entrepreneurship Activities : A Literature Review Research Agenda,"Corporate Entrepreneurship (CE) became the new paradigm for organizations to cope with the accelerated development of innovations. Therefore, especially established organizations increasingly implement CE activities, even in combination. Scholars point out that a coordinated portfolio of CE activities could yield synergies and thus higher value for the organization and further call for more scientific examinations. This literature review aims to better the understanding of the combined and coordinated use of CE activities as well as about resulting synergies. Results show that there are only very few studies that addressed a combination and/or coordination of CE activities with respect to the creation of additional value, however, without empirical analyses. Yet, five categories of direct and indirect synergies could be derived. Discussing the results as well as the heterogenous use of terminology and concepts, this paper concludes with a research agenda for future analyses.",Heinzelmann N.; Baltes G.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2019",2019-06-01,Hochschule Konstanz University of Applied Sciences,coordination ;  corporate entrepreneurship ;  entrepreneurial activities ;  interaction ;  synergies
Policy agendas on Human Resources in Science and Technology in South Korea: From a new perspective,"This study examines the challenges of HRST (Human Resources in Science and Technology) Policy in South Korea. It faces challenges such as the extinction of existing jobs and the demand for new capabilities. To adapt flexibly to new jobs in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the importance of developing science and technology capabilities has been growing.The emphasis of Science and Technology policy is also changing. It cannot be said that the government has achieved its policy goals only through budgetary spending. Recently, more attention is given to the policy impact and efficacy that address societal problems such as unemployment or a decrease in the economically productive population [1].It is necessary to look more clearly at the challenges of HTST policy in South Korea through accurate analysis of current/existing projects. The target of the HRST policies should be extended to the underprivileged, such as women and retirees. It should also include more active programs to meet increasing needs for job training, work-based learning, and career diversification in relation to the life-long learning. Therefore, this study could provide some implications not only for skills training policies and educational innovation of Engineering Colleges but also for launching new government projects from a new perspective.",Joo H.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2019",2019-06-01,Korea Institute of S&T Evaluation and Planning,Educational Innovation ;  HRST policy ;  policy impact ;  ST personnel ;  work-based learning

While it is difficult to obtain clear conclusions based on such early stage applications in other industrial sectors, like the financial sector, some basic insights emerged that could provide general lessons learned to inform players in the energy industry (in particular utilities and the innovation ecosystem around them) about the potential for blockchain in the energy industry, considering of course that stakeholders in this industry operate and innovate under a highly regulated market.",Burer M.; Capezzali M.; Lapparent M.; Pallotta V.; Carpita M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2019",2019-06-01,University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland,blockchain ;  energy transition ;  industrial applications ;  lessons learned ;  smart contracts ;  use cases
A New Approach Dedicated to the Continuous Assessment and Improvement of a Radical Innovation Capacity within a Mature Company,"Owning a radical innovation capacity is a mandatory feature for a mature industrial company that wants to grow. However, this capacity relies on many factors embedded into the whole innovation process, and especially in the Front-End Innovation (FEI) process. Scholars have demonstrated that, a process has to be measurable in order to be potentially improved. One could further imagine that every radical innovation project could evaluate prominent factors in order to improve its effectiveness and efficiency towards a successful outcome. In our previous study, we have identified those prominent factors that significantly impact the effectiveness and efficiency of the FEI process. This paper presents this continuous assessment and improvement new approach allowing radical innovation projects to continuously assess and improve the FEI process effectiveness and efficiency.",Lecossier A.; Pallot M.; Crubleau P.; Richir S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2019",2019-06-01,LAMPA Laboratoire Angevin de Mécanique Procédés et Innovation;Arts et Metiers Institute of Technology,Continuous assessment ;  Ideation ;  Innovation management ;  Innovation Performance ;  Optimization ;  Radical innovation ;  User eXperience
The process of customer/supplier collaboration in innovation projects - A literature review,"The economic and industrial context motivates companies to develop strategies to maintain or improve their competitive advantage. A strategy increasingly used is collaboration with suppliers specifically for the development of innovation projects. However, mixing different organizational structures and cultures is a challenge for companies. The literature presents several key factors, barriers, skills and practices about customer/supplier collaboration, but there is no model that presents a multidimensional vision of the collaborative process. Therefore, the aim is to propose the theoretical bases of a descriptive framework of the collaboration process between customer and supplier in innovation projects. From a literature review, five dimensions are proposed: Ecosystem, strategy, organizational, operational and competencies. Each dimension groups collaboration factors that allow to describe the process.",Moya C.; Boly V.; Galvez D.; Morel L.; Marche B.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2019",2019-06-01,ERPI (Équipe de Recherche sur les Processus Innovatifs),customer-supplier collaboration ;  descriptive framework ;  innovation projects
Supporting User-Driven-Innovation in a Manufacturing Company through a Dedicated Toolkit: An Empirical Study,"This is very well-known that companies have to regularly innovate in order to improve continuously their sustainability in increasing their competitiveness on their market. This is even truer for mature manufacturing companies operating in a B2B market. User-driven innovation (UDI) has already proved its effectiveness in lots of big corporations; however it is quite demanding for average manufacturing companies to properly support it. The aim of this study is to bring valuable knowledge to manufacturing companies aiming to meet this challenge. In this paper, we propose a UDI toolkit in order to ease the implementation of a UDI process within a company. Firstly, an experimental study was carried out within an international manufacturing company in order to analyze the use of the different tools by different employees. Secondly, the UDI impact before and after the implementation of related tools was compared.

Research on technology remote synergic sharing strategy of low carbon under the ETS in China,"Based on the background of the carbon emissions trading market in China, the article considers the impact of low-carbon technology innovation (sharing) on emission reduction interests and the characteristics of inter-temporal effects of technology innovation and external technology sharing in local area. By using differential methods, this article also analyses the dynamic strategies of the regional low-carbon technology stock, which is jointly determined by both the efforts of the local low-carbon technology innovation and the external technology sharing. On the basis of the relevant assumptions, we construct the dynamic models under decentralized decision-making without cost-sharing, decentralized decision-making with cost-sharing and centralized decision-making respectively, and respectively obtain their optimal feedback equilibrium strategies, low-carbon technology stock and the optimal trajectory of profit value function over time. By comparing the three feedback equilibrium strategies, through the extent of Pareto improvement of both the cost-sharing mechanism and cooperative innovation mechanism to the main emission reduction interests, it is found that in the case of centralized decision-making, the more the efforts of low-carbon technological innovation (sharing) in local regions and external regions are endeavored, the higher the overall emission reduction interests than those of non-cooperation to achieve the Pareto optimality. The cost-sharing mechanism can improve the efforts of all subjects and improve the emission reduction interests moderately. Finally, the validity of the model is verified through numerical simulation and the sensitivity of the relevant parameters in the case of cooperative innovation of low-carbon technology is analyzed. And relevant theoretical basis is provided for promoting the long-term cooperation of regional low-carbon technology collaborative sharing in different places.",Wang M.; Liu Y.; Shi W.; Li M.; Zhong C.,Journal,Xitong Gongcheng Lilun yu Shijian/System Engineering Theory and Practice,2019-06-01,Institutes of Science and Development;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;Beijing Normal University;Beijing Institute of Technology,Differential strategy ;  Emission reduction benefits ;  Emissions trading strategy ;  Low-carbon technological innovation ;  Remote synergic sharing strategy ;  Technology stocks
Research progress on alkaline media reactive oxygen species tuning technique in hydrometallurgy,"The green upgrade of the chemical metallurgy manufacturing industry needs to start from the innovation of cleaner production technology. Research and development of efficient, green and reasonable utilization of major characteristic resources are the keys to realizing the sustainable development of resources and environment. Cleaner production is the best pattern of pollution preventing and the only way to achieve sustainable development and recycling economy. The sub-molten salt media clean chemical metallurgical generic technology created by Professor Yi Zhang, academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE), has realized the efficient clean conversion and separation of refractory amphoteric metal minerals with chemical commonality (including Al, Cr, V, Ti, Mn, Nb, Ta, etc.). Reactive oxygen species have been considered as the key factor to realize the efficient conversion of amphoteric metal mineral resources. The sub-molten salt media chemical system with the reactive oxygen species tuning as the core technology was established. The reactive oxygen species tuning strategy in the sub-molten salt media is summarized into five methods, including chemical field enhancement, flow field enhancement, pressure field enhancement, additive enhancement, and microbubble enhancement. All the above methods can be applied to strengthen the decomposition of amphoteric metal mineral resources and decrease the reaction conditions. Till now, the sub-molten salt technology has been successfully applied to the treatment of vanadium titano-magnetite, chromite, diasporic bauxite, tantalum-niobium ores, and high-alumina fly ash. Furthermore, as a feasible, efficient, easy operation and environment-friendly method, electrochemistry plays a vital role in various fields including metallurgy, chemical engineering, and catalysis. Based on the basic research of reactive oxygen species by electrochemical method in our group, novel alkaline electrochemical advanced oxidation processes with electrochemical reactive oxygen species tuning technology were proposed, which provides theoretical and technical support for the application of the reactive oxygen species tuning technology in metallurgy, resources and environment fields.",Zheng S.; Xue Y.; Du H.; Zhang Y.,Journal,Guocheng Gongcheng Xuebao/The Chinese Journal of Process Engineering,2019-06-01,Institute of Process Engineering Chinese Academy of Sciences,Cleaner production ;  Electrochemistry ;  Hydrometallurgy ;  Reactive oxygen species ;  Sub-molten salt
Inclusion as an Enabler to Sustainable Innovations in Smart Cities: A Multi-Level Framework,"Smart cities aim to offer an improved quality of life to citizens, promote economic growth, establish a sustainable approach to development, and ensure efficient service delivery. The main focus in smart cities' research is on the technological aspects of those cities. However, without aligning the design of smart cities with the socio-cultural elements of the communities involved, and without bringing the voices of all stakeholders into the design and implementation of smart cities, sustainable urban development cannot be achieved. Indeed, a holistic approach that emphasis social inclusion of all categories of citizens through a participatory innovation process is needed to achieve sustainable smart cities. Focusing on the social aspects of smart cities, in this work, we examine the impact of gender inclusivity on sustainable engineering, innovation, and the design of future smart cities. Adopting a holistic and synergistic approach, we study how gender inclusivity and innovation intersect with the sustainability agenda in the engineering profession, at three complementary levels: 1) the Micro level, representing individual skills; 2) the Meso level, representing organizations and innovation at the groups' level; and 3) the Macro level representing governments and sustainability at the city level. Using a qualitative research approach with targeted sampling, we conducted semi-structured interviews with male and female directors working at an international engineering and consultancy firm in Dubai, and conduced a focus group discussion with a group of university students who won the innovation category in the Solar Decathlon Middle East 2018 competition for their net-zero energy, dementia friendly home design. Thematic analysis of the data collected was conducted, and a multi-level inclusion framework was proposed based on our findings.

Returning green through engineering: Utilization of monte carlo simulation in assessing potential lifetime value of conventional and sustainable building,"Entering into the age of information where you can quickly access almost anything that happens globally has proven itself beneficial. This study was conducted to assess the performance of conventional buildings and sustainable or green buildings in terms of their potential lifetime value. By analyzing the standard specification of green buildings, people can have a better understanding of this innovation. Data gathered through statistics, literature review, and evaluation from companies, will determine the quantitative information for the creation of the Mathematical Model by the use of Monte Carlo simulation. The Monte Carlo simulation was executed using a software to provide histograms. In order to create scenarios to produce various results, a What-If analysis was also conducted. Consequently, evaluation and analysis of the costs of conventional and green building, gave way for the researcher to make a conclusion with regards to their efficiency. The validity of the results was determined based on anecdotal information by professionals who practiced building sustainable infrastructure. Nevertheless, this research serves as a pilot study to identify the breakeven points between conventional and green buildings.

Enhancing railway engineering student engagement using interactive technology embedded with infotainment,"Interactive learning technology is an emerging innovation for future communication-aided teaching and learning that could positively enhance students’ engagement and intrinsic motivation. Due to the virtue of interactive communication, classrooms are now anticipated to enable a variety of interaction-based learning technologies with diverse infotainment (a subset of “serious play”) integrated with practical enquiry-based projects and case studies for employability improvement. In this paper, a comprehensive review of various teaching and learning pedagogies is assessed. Their suitability and association with infotainment and interactive technology is discussed and highlighted. In addition, a recent research activity on interactive communication is presented to form a new teaching application using interactive technology and infotainment (or edutainment) appropriate for student engagement in railway geometry and alignment design classes. The development of the integrated interactive technology and infotainment was implemented and evaluated in a postgraduate railway engineering class. Questionnaires were used to survey students’ experiences in the classes with and without the technology enhanced learning. The outcome clearly shows that students enjoyed and felt they were significantly engaged in the class with the new interactive resources. Their participation and learning performance increased. Despite the favourable outcomes, the flexibility and viability of using this interactive technology still largely depends on the students’ background and their previous experience.",Kaewunruen S.,Journal,Education Sciences,2019-06-01,University of Birmingham,Active learning ;  Clickers ;  Edutainment ;  Infotainment ;  Interactive technology ;  Railway engineering ;  Student engagement ;  Teaching approaches

Enhancing biological activity of bioactive glass scaffolds by inorganic ion delivery for bone tissue engineering,"This review covers recent research on therapeutic inorganic ions' (TIIs) ‘in situ’ delivery for bone repair and highlights some of the challenges involved, especially related to TII delivery in a controlled and sustained manner from bone tissue engineering (BTE) scaffolds. Strategies for the delivery of relevant biologically active ions with potential angiogenic and osteogenic effects in BTE approaches reported during the last five years are discussed, and the description of delivery techniques to meet bone regeneration requirements is presented. From early approaches using conventional bioceramics, the field has grown tremendously, driven in part by innovations in the biomaterials field, particularly bioactive glasses loaded with and capable to deliver TIIs. Modern advances in drug delivery applied to regenerative medicine focus on the rational design of scaffolds tailored for specific cargo and engineered to exert distinct biological functions. However, even though there is no release system universally suited to different TIIs, specific features and problems of one design or material type can shed light on how to approach TII release in BTE applications generally. Successful strategies to overcome current challenges will have broad application in bone regeneration with great promise for future clinical therapies.",Mouriño V.; Vidotto R.; Cattalini J.; Boccaccini A.,Journal,Current Opinion in Biomedical Engineering,2019-06-01,Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas;Universidad de Buenos Aires;Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg,Bioactive glasses ;  Bone tissue engineering ;  Controlled release ;  Scaffolds ;  Therapeutic ions

The intrapreneurship reactor: how to enable a start-up culture in corporations,"Start-ups successfully deliver creative results, and their success highlights the need for corporate engagement with innovation (Weiblen and Chesbrough in California Management Review 57(2): 66–90, 2015). To assess insights on corporate high-involvement innovation activities, we developed and applied an intrapreneurship model within a multinational financial services corporation in Germany. Successful implementation requires that individuals have the autonomy to act as corporate entrepreneurs (i.e., intrapreneurs). To this end, we introduced a model for implementing and analysing intrapreneurship so corporations could develop a start-up culture. The corporation studied hosted an innovation competition called the Appathon, where competing teams developed app prototypes, and the winning team received funding for continued development. Afterwards, we completed qualitative and quantitative research by interviewing and surveying the competition participants to examine practical intrapreneurship and corporate and individual innovation. Our findings highlight the challenges surrounding the development of high-involvement innovation management routines (Bessant in High involvement innovation, 2003).",Prexl K.,Journal,Elektrotechnik und Informationstechnik,2019-06-01,NOFIMA,absorptive capacity ;  corporate entrepreneurship ;  hybrid high involvement ;  innovation culture ;  innovation management ;  intrapreneurship
Innovation Management in Good Practice Context,"The issue of innovation has also been pursued in social sciences and subsequently specifically in the field of application of socio-scientific knowledge. It is not just about professional engineering ethics but we perceive it in a complex and wider social context. Doing good as well as good practice are more than the professional code of ethics or an effort for technical or managerial excellence. Innovative changes should not be parameterized solely by economic efficiency or performance. With regard to new knowledge and technology development, their ethical aspects become more important and focus more on good life. In the context of social sciences with interdisciplinary trends, applied ethics and its subdisciplines (professional ethics, business ethics, ethics of science and research) can take over and play an important practical role. Innovative processes are increasingly becoming the focus of applied ethics, especially in terms of ethical risks. Our mission is to offer an interdisciplinary view of innovation as discussed in the ethics aspect. Based on these considerations, we conclude that ethics need to be integrated into individual innovation processes and adopted as an important condition for eliminating (mitigating) social risks. In our theoretical considerations we offer a view of the scientific risks and forms of prevention related to innovative change in important areas including engineering practice or health protection.",Fobel P.; Forgon T.; Klimentová Fobelová M.,Journal,Management Systems in Production Engineering,2019-06-01,Silesian University of Technology;Matej Bel University;BB CAE,engineering ethics ;  ethical advice ;  innovation and ethics ;  risks ;  social science
Gas separation by adsorption: technological drivers and opportunities for improvement,"Chemical and petrochemical companies are increasingly realizing that their sustainable development critically depends upon development of new innovative processes that use more efficiently materials and energy. As overall separation/purification processes account for 40–60% of capital and operating costs, their amelioration can significantly reduce costs, energy use and waste generation by increasing profits. Gas separation by adsorption technology is a well-established unit operation in chemical and petrochemical industries due to its efficiency for dealing with a large range of gas separations including impurity removal, gas purification, and separation in recycle streams. The technology is far from being mature and opportunities to expand its domain of applicability and improve its efficiency are high in a context where better understanding of physical phenomena and technological progress in materials and engineering research are integrated. Major contribution for innovations in gas separation by adsorption technology relates to the discovery of new adsorbents with better separation characteristics coupled to process development and its optimization using multi-objective and multi-domain numerical approaches. This short review identifies technological gaps and drivers for accelerating the development of industrially important gas separations by adsorption.",Pullumbi P.; Brandani F.; Brandani S.,Journal,Current Opinion in Chemical Engineering,2019-06-01,Air Liquide;The University of Edinburgh,
Which factors stimulate industrial green total factor productivity growth rate in China? An industrial aspect,"As an important evaluation transformation index, exploring green total factor productivity (GTFP) trend and related key factors is significant for China's economy entering into high-quality development and green transformation. In this study, stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) and kernel density function are used to evaluate GTFP growth trend for 36 China's industrial sectors during 2000–2016, and system generalized method of moment is used to explore their key driving factors. The results are as follows: First, SFA supplies efficient estimation for GTFP growth information. The 36 industrial sectors are classified into three emission types, that is, high-, moderate-, and low emission. Second, GTFP growth differs significantly in three types of sectors. With kernel density results for 36 sectors, the curve of GTFP growth has shifted upward and toward the left since 2010. For high-emission type sectors, their kernel curve has also moved upward and toward the left. The curve of moderate-emission type sectors significantly shifted toward the left, whereas the curve of low-emission type moved upward. Third, based on regression estimation results, environmental regulatory policy, resource input structure, foreign direct investment, and energy-type structure significantly influence GTFP growth. Technology innovation makes insignificant impact on GTFP for industrial sectors. In conclusion, sectorial heterogeneity should be paid more focus in order to improve their growth, especially for high-emission type sectors.

Does the preferences for creativity scale predict engineering students' ability to generate and select creative design alternatives?,"Creativity is universally acknowledged as an important attribute of successful engineering design, but individual attributes and preferences can influence whether creative ideas come to fruition during the design process. However, few studies have explored the factors that can predict creative concept generation and selection in engineering design education. Thus, the current study was developed to provide an empirical understanding of how student designers' preferences for creativity predicts their ability to generate or select creative design alternatives during the concept screening process above and beyond the effects of personality through an empirical study with 178 engineering students. The factors explored included the Big 5 factors of personality, the preferences for creativity scale (PCS), and the novelty and quality of ideas generated and screened. The results show that the openness personality trait can predict the novelty of generated ideas as well as the novelty and quality of selected ideas during the concept screening process and that the creative confidence and preference factor of the PCS can predict the novelty of generated ideas and the novelty and quality of selected ideas during the concept screening process beyond the Big 5 factors of personality. A similar finding was obtained for the risk tolerance factor of the PCS. These findings demonstrate the importance of an individual's attitude toward risk and their creative confidence in the generation and selection of ideas in engineering education and provide a foundation for future research geared at building student innovation capacities.",Toh C.; Miller S.,Journal,Journal of Mechanical Design,2019-06-01,University of Nebraska Omaha;Pennsylvania State University,
A Virtual Repository of Neurosurgical Instrumentation for Neuroengineering Research and Collaboration,"Background: Advancements in microscopy and more recently in neuroendoscopy have revolutionized the field of neurosurgery. Handheld neurosurgical instruments are integral components of these procedures. However, these instruments have many limitations, such as poor ergonomics, constrained maneuverability, and limited degrees of freedom. A need for developing better instruments is commonly felt by neurosurgeons. Also, the focus of modern neurosurgical training is shifting toward simulation models. The baseline data of surgical instruments play a vital role in the development of virtual and physical simulators. A primary factor impeding development of novel instruments and simulators is lack of a comprehensive surgical instrument database. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a virtual repository of microscopic and neuroendoscopic instruments. Methods: Standard neurosurgical instrument sets were scanned, reverse engineered, and stored in various file formats at the file transfer protocol server. The developed database was validated by 4 groups of experts by creating different neurosurgery applications. Results: Four groups of experts used the repository content to create novel ergonomic instrument designs, e-learning material, computer vision–based surgical skills evaluation and virtual reality and validated the contents. The validation results showed that quality of content (75%), usefulness of content (85.6%), and time saving using content (88.1%) received high scores, and the effectiveness of the virtual repository contents was appreciated. Conclusions: The virtual database is an efficient starting aid to foster research collaborations related to neurosurgical instruments and surgical simulation platforms.",Singh R.; Baby B.; Suri A.,Journal,World Neurosurgery,2019-06-01,"Indian Institute of Technology Delhi;All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi",Blue light scanning ;  Innovation ;  Neurosurgical instruments ;  Reverse engineering ;  Simulation ;  Virtual repository

Inter-technology relationship networks: Arranging technologies through text mining,"Ongoing advances in digital technologies – which enable new products, services, and business models – have fundamentally affected business and society through several waves of digitalization. When analyzing digital technologies, a dynamic system or an ecosystem model that represents interrelated technologies is beneficial owing to the systemic character of digital technologies. Using an assembly-based process model for situational method engineering, and following the design science research paradigm, we develop an analytical method to generate technology-related network data that retraces elapsed patterns of technological change. We consider the technological distances that characterize technologies' proximities and dependencies. We use established text mining techniques and draw from technology innovation research as justificatory knowledge. The proposed method processes textual data from different information sources into an analyzable and readable inter-technology relationship network. To evaluate the method, we use exemplary digital technologies from the big data analytics domain as an application scenario.",Hofmann P.; Keller R.; Urbach N.,Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2019-06-01,Universität Bayreuth;Universität Augsburg;Project Group Business & Information Systems Engineering of the Fraunhofer FIT;Project Group Business and Information Systems Engineering of the Fraunhofer FIT,Method construction ;  Network ;  Patent mining ;  Tech mining ;  Text mining

"The imagined electric vehicle user: Insights from pioneering and prospective buyers in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom","This research explores how socio-technical imaginaries about electric vehicles and their users developed in the context of the Plugged-in Places programme in Milton Keynes, UK. Collectively imagined forms of social life and social order are reflected in the design and fulfilment of scientific and technological projects as imagined futures shape the technological search space and influence social responses to innovation (Jasanoff and Kim, 2009, 2013). This research focuses on the imaginaries of pioneering and prospective adopters of EVs in business organizations in Milton Keynes. The imaginaries of organizational buyers and fleet managers subtly shaped their exploration of early-market vehicles as they articulated the demands, barriers and motivations of users within their firm. This research draws on a thematic analysis of interviews with business and governmental actors, policy documents and trade literature discussing the early-market adoption of EVs by business organizations. The results identify the processes through which business adopters make sense of the new technology as well as the policies and organizations that supported their learning process. In addition to technical concerns, key aspects concerned patterns of use and demand, fitness for operations, and new business and operational models suited to the characteristics of EVs. Thus, it is concluded that the imaginaries of business adopters and of the organizations supporting them increasingly envision adopters not just as rational optimizers but also as complex problem solvers working out new ways to embed EVs in innovative, competitive configurations that work for them.",Valdez A.; Potter S.; Cook M.,Journal,Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment,2019-06-01,The Open University,
Crowdfunding technological innovations: Interaction between consumer benefits and rewards,"This research aims to examine how consumer benefits stated in the project title and the number of rewards in the crowdfunding context interactively impact the number of backers and funding success for technological innovations. The authors collected data of 674 technological projects from kickstarter.com. Data collection was completed at two points of time, Time 1 (projects were still active) and Time 2 (funding periods were over). Findings between them were highly consistent. Two coding assignments were used. First, two independent raters assessed consumer benefits claimed in the project title; second, the research team coded the number of reward levels in each crowdfunding project and the number of rewards included in each reward level. In total, 134,492 rewards across 4509 reward levels were recorded. The authors find that the number of backers increases the likelihood of funding success. Additionally, consumer benefits increase the number of backers. The average number of rewards affects the number of backers in an inverted-U shape, and it also moderates the relationship between consumer benefits and the number of backers in an inverted-U shape.",Zhang H.; Chen W.,Journal,Technovation,2019-06-01,New Jersey Institute of Technology,Backers ;  Consumer benefits ;  Crowdfunding ;  Rewards ;  Technological innovations
An empirical analysis of consumer resistance to smart-lighting products,"Considering the low market penetration of smart-lighting technology, this study investigates the drivers and consequences of consumer resistance to these innovative lighting products. The paper builds on research on passive and active consumer resistance and on the technology acceptance theory to analyse individuals’ inclination to adopt or reject smart-lighting products. Moreover, the paper evaluates the moderating effects of gender and age. In addition to the influence of passive and active innovation resistance and based on a representative survey of German consumers (N = 653), the empirical results identify performance expectancy, social pressure and compatibility and health concerns as major determinants of consumer behaviour. Furthermore, the results vary among consumers of different ages and genders. A follow-up study (N = 115) investigates consumers’ health concerns more deeply. This study provides practical implications and avenues for future research.",Juric J.; Lindenmeier J.,Journal,Lighting Research and Technology,2019-06-01,Universität Freiburg,

"Fab:UNIverse - Makerspaces, Fab Labs and lab managers in Academia","Fab Labs and ""Maker"" practices have been recognized in research and practice as contexts that facilitate creativity, knowledge sharing and collaboration [4], [10]. Personal digital fabrication is getting increasing attention from various fields like education, engineering, innovation, design, humanitarian aid or regional development [6], [1], [7], [3]. However, integrating Fab Lab environments into academic education is still challenging in practice. In Germany, more than 200 such creative community spaces exist [5]; around 15 of these are associated with universities. Most are initiated and run by single entities such as student groups or university chairs and are not integrated in the universities' overall organizational matters.

The R&D knowledge base in city-agglomerations and knowledge searching in product innovative SMEs,"This paper looks at the relation between the R&D knowledge base of city-agglomerations and knowledge sourcing in product innovative small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The small open Belgian economy is used as a test case. The characteristics of the city-agglomeration’s R&D knowledge are posited to be instrumental for SMEs’ reliance on particular sources of information for innovation. The R&D knowledge base is studied as a multidimensional concept consisting of R&D capacity, R&D specialization and R&D diversification. A representative sample of product innovative SMEs drawn from two waves of the Community Innovation Survey between 2008 and 2012 reveals that a strong R&D capacity at city-agglomeration level favours private external information sources for innovation, but has no influence on the likelihood to rely on public sources for innovation. Accordance between specialization of the private R&D knowledge base and the SME’s activities positively influences the use of clients as information sources for innovation, whereas under these circumstances supplier responsiveness turns out to be less frequently solicited for. A more diversified private R&D environment reduces the reliance on universities and public research organizations as information sources for innovation. A public R&D knowledge base specialized in natural sciences or engineering favours information sources from universities.",Teirlinck P.; Spithoven A.,Journal,Entrepreneurship and Regional Development,2019-05-27,Universiteit Gent;KU Leuven,city-agglomeration ;  Knowledge sourcing ;  R&D capacity ;  R&D knowledge base ;  R&D specialization and diversification ;  SMEs

Increasing access to music in SEn settings,"This paper presents some of the outcomes of a one year Higher Education Innovation Fund1 funded project examining the use of music technology to increase access to music for children within special educational need (SEN) settings. Despite the widely acknowledged benefits of interacting with music for children with SEN there are a number of well documented barriers to access [1, 2, 3]. These barriers take a number of forms including financial, knowledge based or attitudinal. The aims of this project were to assess the current music technology provision in SEN schools within a particular part of the Dorset region, UK, determine the barriers they were facing and develop strategies to help the schools overcome these barriers. An overriding concern for this project was to leave the schools with lasting benefit and meaningful change. As such an Action Research [4] methodology was followed, which has at its heart an understanding of the participants as co-researchers helping ensure any solutions presented met the needs of the stakeholders. The presumption by the researchers was that the schools needed new technology to help overcome barriers. However, although technological solutions to problems were presented to the school, it was found that the main issues were around the flexibility of equipment to be used in different locations, staff time and staff attitudes to technology. These issues were addressed through the Action Research methodology to ensure that the technology designed worked for these particular use case scenarios.",Davis T.; Pierson D.; Bevan A.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the Sound and Music Computing Conferences,2019-05-20,Bournemouth University,
Incentives and inhibiting factors of eco-innovation in the Spanish firms,"This paper investigates the incentives and inhibiting factors of eco-innovation capacities in the firm. Firms materialize the objectives of eco-innovation from a reactive attitude to external pressures, to a more proactive attitude that implies the voluntary incorporation of eco-innovation activities. This variability in the behaviour of companies with respect to the level of eco-innovation development has been a motivator for the research. However, despite the importance of this research question, this has been approached in a dispersed way from multiple approaches. From a dynamic capabilities perspective, we assume that the innovation capacity of the firm encourages eco-innovations. Our paper is focused on the process of eco-innovation, identifying the elements that facilitate or hinder the eco-innovation in the firm. We study the Spanish case, using a panel from the Spanish Innovation Survey, with a sample of 5461 Spanish firms. The results highlight that the complexity of the eco-innovation process negatively affects the decision to develop eco-innovations. However, our results suggest that institutions and organizations of the Spanish environment are making efforts to compensate these obstacles and provide incentives to develop eco-innovations.",Arranz N.; Arroyabe M.; Molina-García A.; Fernandez de Arroyabe J.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2019-05-20,Essex Business School;Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia;Universidad Politécnica de Madrid,Eco-innovation ;  Incentives and inhibiting factors ;  Innovation capacity ;  Spain
Exploration of training mode for PhD students of nuclear engineering,"One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative is a paramount national strategy of China, which greatly promotes the technical innovations like those in the nuclear energy industry. The Chinese HPR1000 reactor, with independent intellectual property rights, has been exported to various countries all over the world. China's nuclear energy industry is undergoing a rapid development, which demands large numbers of experts specializing in the nuclear energy. Thus, qualified PhD students play a pivotal role in this process. Moreover, the nuclear energy industry encounters ceaseless real-world state-of-the-art problems, and academic researches generally feed on them that would finally become the PhD students' theses and dissertations. Therefore, the paradigm for intimate university-industry partnership is required. The university-industry collaboration system provides an effective approach to cultivating high-level talents for the nuclear energy industry. Since 1996, Tsinghua University (THU) has cooperated with companies such as China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) to enroll 60 students orientated to the nuclear energy industry every year, approximately10%-15% of which would subsequently pursue doctoral degrees. This paper will illustrate, build, optimize and investigate the training mode for PhD students majoring in the nuclear science and engineering based on the university-industry collaboration system in THU.

Code_Aster - An EDF open-source software to solve advanced structural problems,"EDF is an international utility with a large fleet of nuclear reactors, including 58 in France only. EDF must ensure with credibility and in the long run the control of its computational tool in order to ensure the safe operation of its electricity generation assets, chief among them being its Nuclear Power Plants. Therefore, in 1989, EDF R&D has chosen to develop its own numerical simulation FEA software for structural analysis, code_aster (www.code-aster.org), for EDF's needs in computational mechanics. Widely used in-house for the expertise and the maintenance of power plants and electrical networks, code_aster is a unique product which fulfills two main objectives: - an efficient software for engineering studies with quality assurance requirements; - Dissemination within EDF of its research work in various computational mechanics fields. Since 2001, code_aster is distributed as a free software (i.e. GNU general public license - no commercial licensing of the code by EDF). Since justifying quality labels is required by the nuclear industry, most of the functionalities of the software have been validated by thorough independent comparisons with analytical or experimental results and benchmarks towards other codes. Code_aster is integrated today in the Salomé-Meca platform, which also includes 3D modeling, meshing and post-processing modules. As an expertise code, it includes very recent and exploratory methods and at the same time offers the flexibility to the user to adjust a number of parameters to accommodate for any new innovation in a given field. This publication aims at introducing code_aster and its capabilities in terms of structural mechanics simulation. It will first provide background information on the code and its environment and then focus on illustrative mechanical examples.",Liu H.; Geoffroy D.; Min J.,Conference Proceeding,"International Conference on Nuclear Engineering, Proceedings, ICONE",2019-05-18,Electricité de France;EDF China;Tianrun Fortune Ctr Twr A,Code-Aster ;  Open-source ;  Structural mechanics simulation
Activities of haeorum alliance nuclear innovation center for improved public acceptance and research infrastructures,"Nuclear power plants in Republic of Korea are concentrated at East Sea, especially for Ulsan, Gyeongju, and Pohang, those are affiliated to Haeorum alliance. There have been public acceptance issues on nuclear power plant due to high concentration of nuclear power plant in Haeroum region. The issue is being intensified through the present government`s policies to phase out NPPs, despite absence of alternative energy and blackout risk. To resolve the public acceptance issue and reinforce the safety of NPPs under operation, Haeroum Alliance Nuclear Innovation Center was established at April 2018, funded by Korea hydro & Nuclear Power Co., Ltd.

"Electrocaloric Cooling Materials and Devices for Zero-Global-Warming-Potential, High-Efficiency Refrigeration","Electrocaloric cooling technologies, enabled by the discovery of the giant electrocaloric effect in dielectrics more than a decade ago, represents a zero-global-warming-potential, environment-benign cooling alternative. Benefited from its nature as an electricity-driven capacitor, the electrocaloric working body renders the great advantages in the energy efficiency and the device integration. The decade-long efforts on advancing the technology revealed many promising material candidates with matured manufacturing protocols, as well as intriguing device prototypes for applications beyond the traditional vapor compression based cooling. This article presents the recent advances in electrocaloric cooling technologies, from material improvements to device demonstrations. The environmental impact and the energy efficiency of the technology were evaluated by the total effective warming impact and the material COP, respectively. In addition to the current progresses achieved by the decade-long research effort, the existing challenges and potential opportunities brought by the electrocaloric refrigeration will be discussed. In general, applying or removing an external work to a refrigerant can cause a reversible phase transition with heat ejection or absorption. Various thermodynamic cycles based on the liquid-gaseous phase transition are where the foundation of conventional vapor compression refrigeration (VCR) was built on. Analogous to the VCR, the electrocaloric refrigeration (ECR) utilizes an electric field to induce a dipolar order-disorder phase transition where a reversible temperature change enables the heat pumping. The discovery of the giant electrocaloric effect (ECE) in solid-state materials a decade ago quickly revived the interests on the ECR from both academia and industrial. Numerous advances have been achieved in condensed matter physics, from normal FE to relaxor FE and from solid-state dielectrics to fluidic dielectrics. The ECE-induced temperature changes exceeded 30 K under high external electric fields. The ECR is environmentally benign. Operating a solid-state or condensed matter cooling agent, ECR emits no harmful gas directly, such as gases with ozone depletion potential (ODP) and/or global warming potential (GWP). The electrocaloric (EC) materials hold the promise of high energy efficiency because of their nature as low-loss insulators. Overall, our review shows that the ECR exhibits an incredibly low total equivalent warming impact (TEWI), with both direct and indirect equivalent CO2 emission considered. EC cooling devices have been demonstrated by researchers in university research groups as well as in R&D centers of industrial cooperation that are pioneering in the field. The uniqueness of the EC working bodies, i.e., compressor-free, low-noise, high-efficiency, flexibility, scalability, optic transparency, electromechanical maneuverability, etc., may extend the ECR to new application scenarios beyond the traditional household refrigeration and air conditioners. Future advances of the ECR could lead to point-of-care, distributive thermal management, on-chip cooling, wearable thermal management, and highly efficient climate-controlling systems for electric vehicles. The development of this interdisciplinary field calls for in-depth collaboration among research societies of condensed matter physics, material engineering, mechanical and thermal engineering, refrigeration and cryogenics, and industrial manufacturing. The global climate shift calls for a series of technical innovations that exhibit low-carbon-emission over their lifetimes. The discovery of the giant electrocaloric effect (ECE) stimulated a new research field of the environmental-benign, high-efficiency cooling technology, which extends the boundary of the conventional refrigeration as well as the condensed matter physics. In this review, we summarize the major advances of the ECE in the fundamental physics, materials, devices demos, and the state of arts over the last decade. Challenges, opportunities, and perspectives of the future development of the rejuvenated research field are discussed.",Shi J.; Han D.; Li Z.; Yang L.; Lu S.; Zhong Z.; Chen J.; Zhang Q.; Qian X.,Journal,Joule,2019-05-15,Penn State College of Engineering;Shanghai Jiao Tong University;Guangdong University of Technology;Ministry of Ecology and Environment,dielectrics ;  electrocaloric materials and devices ;  energy conversions ;  ferroelectrics ;  TEWI ;  total equivalent warming impact ;  zero-GWP refrigeration
Avoiding the Hype in Developing Commercially Viable Desalination Technologies,"Hype-driven desalination research often leads to a misappropriation of resources that can stunt truly disruptive innovation. By marrying “hot” technologies (i.e., carbon nanotubes and graphene)to a timely need (the water crisis), poor decisions can be made in identifying viable research and development pathways for making a real impact on the desalination industry. Diverting research dollars to these less-viable pathways can lessen the availability of funds for greater opportunities that are more likely to lead to tangible improvements in desalination.",McCutcheon J.,Journal,Joule,2019-05-15,University of Connecticut,
Advancing Knowledge in Technological Innovation : Innovation Mapping Model,"Organizations and entrepreneurs use innovation-mapping models to map their innovation patterns, detect dominant innovation types and explore new areas where they can focus their future innovation projects at. The objective of this paper is to propose a new mapping model that can map more innovation areas or dimensions and overcome the gaps existing in the current mapping models. This new model will contribute to the advancement of the knowledge in innovation classification and mapping, which in turn shall enhance knowledge in engineering education scope. The analysis of the current innovation mapping models revealed many gaps and potential improvement areas. For example, current mapping models are not capable to map all combinations of innovation dimensions, and they are not capable to show the sustainability attributes of the innovation as well. To propose a new innovation-mapping model, a literature review on the innovation types, and the currently used classification and mapping models was conducted. The area of innovation for sustainability was also discussed and analyzed, and based on that, a new mapping model was proposed. The new proposed model is capable to model one, two, three, and four-dimensional innovation types. It is also capable to map the degree of novelty and sustainability attributes in innovations. For future research, it is suggested to test the validity and ease of use of the proposed model in different industries.",Ubaid A.; Sahban M.; Hammad O.; Ramadan A.; Abdel-Razek R.,Conference Proceeding,"2019 Advances in Science and Engineering Technology International Conferences, ASET 2019",2019-05-14,University of Sharjah,classification ;  innovation ;  mapping ;  models ;  technological

Firm Innovation Capability through Knowledge Sharing at Indonesian Small and Medium Industries: Impact of Tacit and Explicit Knowledge Perspective,"Tacit knowledge is an asset that is embedded in an individual, while explicit knowledge is a type of knowledge that can be readily documented in an organization. Both types of knowledge are crucial for knowledge sharing within any organization as both are primary factors to boost innovation capability. Knowledge sharing process requires an enabler in its process. This research studies Small and Medium Industries (SMI), where knowledge sharing between one SMI to another is necessary, which enables a group of SMIs within a certain area to grow altogether. This research aims to analyze how the innovation capability of a company is influenced by knowledge sharing with the perspective of both tacit and explicit knowledge. The result shows that each indicator in every construct has a good validity, reliability, and significance level, which evidently suggests that a company's capacity to share knowledge, both tacitly and explicitly, is indeed significant and influential towards the innovation capability of such company in this case, SMI.",Rumanti A.; Wiratmadja I.; Sunaryo I.; Ajidarma P.; Ari Samadhi T.,Conference Proceeding,"2019 IEEE 6th International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Applications, ICIEA 2019",2019-05-14,Telkom University;Institut Teknologi Bandung,firm innovation capability ;  knowledge sharing ;  small and medium industries

A simple synthesis process for combinational QCA circuits: Qsynthesizer,"Quantum-dot-Cellular Automata (QCA) is coming up as the viable technology which may replace existing CMOS technology. In this context, Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools for design and fabrication like simulation, synthesis, testing etc. are essential. After design entry and behavioral simulation, the synthesis tool is used to convert the behavioral level description into gate level description. The synthesized circuit can be later on used for functional and timing verification, test development and further layout level synthesis. Even though, few QCA synthesis methods are available in the literature, there is lack of simple QCA synthesis method which uses commonly available CMOS based EDA tools as far as possible and hence, less costly. Therefore, in this paper, a simple but novel synthesis method for combinational QCA circuit “QSynthesizer” is proposed. The authors do neither claim an optimized method of synthesis nor a very high level of research in the field of QCA synthesis tool development. Still, this paper definitely contains a frugal innovation for synthesizing QCA circuit in absence of rarely available, low cost QCA synthesizers. The proposed synthesis method comprises logic reduction algorithm implemented in C++, Perl scripts and widely used synthesis tools like Leonardo Spectrum for digital design. The results on Microelectronics Centre of North Carolina (MCNC) benchmark circuits using proposed QSynthesizer show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",Dhare V.; Mehta U.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 32nd International Conference on VLSI Design, VLSID 2019 - Held concurrently with 18th International Conference on Embedded Systems, ES 2019",2019-05-09,"Nirma University, Institute of Technology",Logic Reduction ;  Majority Voter ;  QCA ;  Synthesis method

Mechanical properties of bamboo yarn: A biodegradable composite material for structural works,"The hazardous effects of synthetic and petroleum-based polymers on the environment have called for environmental friendly, renewable, and sustainable materials and have become a topic of research for many scientists and other researchers across the globe, researching natural fibers as an alternative reinforcement polymer composite raw material. Natural fibers are readily available and cheap and have less weight, less energy, and superior mechanical properties such as high strength and stiffness. Bamboo yarn as reinforcement of polymer composites is nonabrasive, ecofriendly, and biodegradable and can serve as a raw material for industrial engineering applications. In this chapter, the study aims to evaluate the mechanical properties of bamboo yarn (woven or bidirectional) and (unwoven or 45° orientation) as reinforcement in polymer composite, an innovation to utilize its properties in structural designing and fabrication of laminates. The extraction and treatment processes of bamboo yarn and its application as reinforcement in polymer composite are explained in this chapter. The impact, flexural, tensile, and scanning electron microscope were performed to evaluate the mechanical properties and surface morphology of the composites. The influence of bamboo yarn orientation, yarn content, size, and treatment agents on the mechanical properties of the composite was investigated. The chapter discusses the fabrication process of the composite and examines the bamboo yarn-epoxy matrix interfacial bonding, taking into consideration the moisture effect on the composite. The thermal stability and thermal degradation of the composite were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis and differential thermogravimetric analysis in a nitrogen atmosphere.",Akwada D.; Akinlabi E.,Book,"Biodegradable Composites: Materials, Manufacturing and Engineering",2019-05-06,University of Johannesburg,Bamboo extraction ;  Bamboo yarn ;  Epoxy matrix ;  Mechanical properties ;  Thermogravimetric analysis ;  Treatment process ;  Woven bamboo yarn
Archive as Laboratory: Engaging STEM Students & STEM Collections,"As STEM students come to populate undergraduate courses in the liberal arts to fulfill university distribution requirements, they outnumber their humanities counterparts. A history professor and archivist working at a university that predominantly produces STEM majors have partnered to teach these students by utilizing the special collections related to engineering, innovation, and discovery in classroom work and assignments. This Critical Participation article presents the model of the ‘archive as laboratory’ to facilitate critical inquiry, introduce archival literacy to scientists and engineers, and expand students’ concept of information sources. Students gain an understanding that research questions can be addressed through multiple kinds of evidence that the archives is uniquely situated to provide. The immersive learning experience is enhanced by coursework that incorporates foundational theories and approaches from Science & Technology Studies. The lab model engages the archive as a hands-on workspace and a place where students can practice research skills. Engaging the archive as a laboratory fosters inquiry and critical thinking, and connects histories of innovation, problem identification, and design practice to students’ own majors and their future careers.

"Generative modeling, virtual reality and hbim interaction: Immersive environment for built heritage: Case study of shaikh isa bin ali house, Bahrain","The innovation in Digital Cultural Heritage (DCH) shows an emergence of innovative methods and initiatives for the generation of complex historical models to which are linked useful information for specialists of architecture, construction and engineering, but also user community interested in cultural heritage. This paper presents an improvement in Historic Building Information Modeling (HBIM) turned into models for mobile apps based on virtual reality (VR) addressed to enhance the communication of Architectural Heritage. The opportunity of a collaboration with the Bahrain Authority for Culture and Antiquities (BACA) experts under the coordination of the Carleton University in a training project aimed at improving documentation skills for conservation and preventive maintenance of built heritage provided the availability of an extraordinary richness of data and surveying on the Shaikh Isa Bin Ali House. The case study of the Shaikh Isa Bin Ali House is an outstanding example of Bahrain architecture and one of the oldest surviving building in Muharraq, listed under the UNESCO sites, now transformed in a Museum, where the visit does not allow to perceive the richness of the traditions of the constructions, beside the beautiful architecture. The building was the seat of the ruler of Bahrain from 1869 until his death in 1932 and represented an interesting response to local building materials and climate. This vernacular architecture solved not only the climate problems but combined the solution with beauty, physical and social functionality. This research carries out digital preservation through HBIM and switches to Cloud and VR platforms to allow users to enter a 3D immersive scene, using models as a vehicle of content information.",Banfi F.; Brumana R.; Aljishi A.; Al Sayeh N.; Santana Quintero M.; Cuca B.; Oreni D.; Midali C.,Conference Proceeding,"ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences",2019-05-04,Politecnico di Milano;Carleton University;Bahrain Authority for Culture and Antiquities,Bioclimatic Architecture ;  Generative modeling ;  Grade of Generation (GOG) ;  Heritage Building Information Modeling (HBIM) ;  Interactivity. ;  Scan-To-BIM ;  Virtual Reality (VR)
"Comparison of geophysical inversion programs run on aeromagnetic data collected over the Highland Valley Copper district, British Columbia, Canada","As part of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada-Canada Mining Innovation Council (NSERC-CMIC) Mineral Exploration Footprints project, three selected magnetic inversion programs (VPmg, MAG3D and VINV) were used to process the same aeromagnetic data set from the Highland Valley Copper district, British Columbia, Canada. In each case, the inversion was constrained using available geological and physical property constraints. Analysis of magnetic susceptibility data suggests that the observed aeromagnetic anomaly pattern includes effects associated with boundaries between lithological units and fault zone alteration resulting from removal of magnetite. Susceptibility contrast associated with alteration is greater than that associated with changes in lithology. The inversions seek to define the three-dimensional geometry of geological boundaries and the fractures are treated as high-frequency noise. Results from the three programs, although similar, are sensitive to attributes of the different algorithms. VPmg emphasises physical boundaries between geological domains, MAG3D produces a more blurred image, whereas VINV produces reasonable geological images. Computer performance using the different programs ranges from reasonable for VPmg to computer intensive for MAG3D and VINV. Differences in the results reflect the inherent uncertainty in producing inversions from ""noisy"" aeromagnetic data.",Vallée M.; Farquharson C.; Morris W.; King J.; Byrne K.; Lesage G.; Lee R.; Chouteau M.; Enkin R.,Journal,Exploration Geophysics,2019-05-04,McMaster University;University of Alberta;Polytechnique Montréal;Memorial University of Newfoundland;SYDNEY,aeromagnetic method ;  geological model ;  Geophysical inversion ;  porphyry copper ;  uncertainty
Peering into the Future of Intelligent Systems: Lessons from the SPRING Program,"Overview: Innovation leaders face the challenge of planning for their organizations’ future in a time of technological and economic upheaval; the rapid emergence and proliferation of intelligent systems will be a key factor in that upheaval, and a key technology that organizations must be prepared to manage. A foresight program can help organizations map the challenges and opportunities presented by emerging technologies and serve as a valuable input to organizational strategic planning. IRI and RTI International developed a foresight program for intelligent systems to guide companies in framing, exploring, envisioning, and acting on the impacts intelligent systems may have. Working from an intelligent systems research framework, the program identified 70 key drivers of change and developed three scenarios depicting plausible and thought-provoking visions of the future of intelligent systems. These scenarios highlight critical uncertainties and help innovators challenge conventional notions about how the future might unfold. The steps taken in developing the scenarios can provide the basis for other organizations’ use of foresight methodologies to better understand the possible impact of intelligent systems on their strategic goals and objectives.",Culver T.; Green L.; Redden J.,Journal,Research Technology Management,2019-05-04,,Artificial intelligence ;  Foresight ;  Intelligent systems ;  Scenario planning
"The importance of the democratic and multidirectional exchange of values between scientists, STEM educators, and historically underrepresented members of the community","In the 21st century, conversations regarding responsible research and innovation (RRI) place a strong emphasis on the need for inclusion of historically underrepresented communities in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines. However, many of the current methodologies for integration with STEM require members of underrepresented communities to gain representation via metrics which assess progress in an institutionalized or university setting. This form of STEM integration is exclusive rather than inclusive because it insists that underrepresented community members participate in institutionalized science to acquire representation. Alternatively, members of underrepresented communities require more diverse avenues through which to participate in science. Diversifying the opportunities for underrepresented communities to contribute offers increased potential for the democratic, equitable, and multidirectional exchange of values between scientists, STEM practitioners, and members of underrepresented communities.",Lusk B.,Journal,Journal of Responsible Innovation,2019-05-04,ScienceTheEarth,21st century skills ;  democracy ;  empathy ;  inclusion ;  science ;  STEM education ;  values
Research on technologically managed integrated systems of steel box girder manufacturing in the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao bridge of China,"Currently, China’s traditional steel manufacturing technology and equipment cannot meet the requirements of the project quality and manufacturing progress of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB). Further challenges are faced by foreign steel manufacturing (i.e. high costs, long cycles and human sea tactics are not suitable for the engineering reality of the HZMB). As a result of these challenges, the steel box girder of the HZMB has achieved an optimal allocation of resources through technological innovation and management as a complete collaborative innovation system. This has improved the management ability to handle complex problems through the formation of a steel box girder, which has formed a typical case with regard to management systems. This chapter performs a complete case analysis and theoretical analysis regarding the HZMB steel box girder manufacturing technological management system from four aspects: background and countermeasures, technologically managed comprehensive system design, the strategic position and responsibilities of the owner, and the effect of the implementation of these aspects. This has provided China’s major infrastructure construction and management system with a valuable case of system management and experience, enriching innovation with regard to management ideas and theories concerning the complexity of major engineering projects based on China’s reality.",Qiu Y.; Sheng Z.,Book,Innovative Production And Construction: Transforming Construction Through Emerging Technologies,2019-05-03,Nanjing University,Steel box girder manufacture ;  System management ;  Technologically managed integrated system ;  The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao bridge
HCI and Affective Health Taking stock of a decade of studies and charting future research directions,"In the last decade, the number of articles on HCI and health has increased dramatically. We extracted 139 papers on depression, anxiety and bipolar health issues from 10 years of SIGCHI conference proceedings. 72 of these were published in the last two years. A systematic analysis of this growing body of literature revealed that most innovation happens in automated diagnosis, and self-tracking, although there are innovative ideas in tangible interfaces. We noted an overemphasis on data production without consideration of how it leads to fruitful interventions. Moreover, we see a need to promote ethical practices for involvement of people living with affective disorders. Finally, although only 16 studies evaluate technologies in a clinical context, several forms of support and intervention illustrate how rich insights are gained from evaluations with real patients. Our findings highlight potential for growth in the design space of affective health technologies.",Sanches P.; Janson A.; Karpashevich P.; Nadal C.; Qu C.; Roquet C.; Umair M.; Windlin C.; Doherty G.; Höök K.; Sas C.,Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2019-05-02,Lancaster University;Trinity College Dublin;The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH),Affective disorders ;  Clinical trials ;  Ethical issues ;  Innovation ;  Literature review
Designing for the infrastructure of the supply chain of Malay handwoven songket in Terengganu,"The growing HCI interest in developing contexts and cultural craft practices is ripe to focus on their underexplored homegrown sociotechnical infrastructures. This paper explores the creative infrastructural actions embedded within the practices of songket’s supply chain in Terengganu, Malaysia. We report on contextual interviews with 92 participants including preparation workers, weavers, designers, merchants, and customers. Findings indicate that increased creative infrastructural actions are reflected in these actors’ resourcefulness for mobilizing information, materials, and equipment, and for making creative artifacts through new technologies weaved within traditional practices. We propose two novel approaches to design in this craft-based infrastructure. First, we explore designing for the social layer of infrastructure and its mutually advantageous exploitative relationships rooted in culture and traditions. Second, we suggest designing for roaming value-creation artifacts, which blend physical and digital materializations of songket textile design. Developed through a collaborative and asynchronous process, we argue that these artifacts represent less-explored vehicles for value co-creation, and that sociotechnical infrastructures as emerging sites of innovation could benefit from HCI research.",Zhang M.; Sas C.; Lambert Z.; Ahmad M.,Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2019-05-02,Lancaster University;Universiti Teknologi MARA,Crafts ;  Cultural heritage ;  Gender ;  HCID ;  Infrastructure ;  Songket

Guidelines for combining storytelling and gamification: Which features would teenagers desire to have a more enjoyable museum experience?,"While museums are often designed to engage and interest a wide variety of audiences, teenagers are a neglected segment. This PhD research in Digital Media explores how digital technologies can facilitate natural history museums in creating immersive museum experiences for teenagers (15-18 years old), especially through digital storytelling and gamification frameworks. This contribution would be a set of guidelines that will aid in designing interactive experiences inside these museums. So far, we have involved a total of 155 teens through co-design sessions, 130 in focus groups, and 98 in usability studies, as well as 3 museums, 12 curators, and 17 master students. Through qualitative analysis, our preliminary findings suggest that teenagers value gamification and storytelling elements when thinking about enjoyable museum tours, while curators value story-based narratives as the most prominent method to provide enjoyable museum experience for teens. Based on the findings identified, and in collaboration with the Madeira-ITI, two interactive mobile experiences targeted at teenagers were developed for the Natural History Museum of Funchal, Portugal.",Cesário V.,Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2019-05-02,Universidade do Porto,ACM proceedings ;  Co-design ;  Gamification ;  Museums ;  Storytelling ;  Teenagers ;  User experience ;  User-driven innovation ;  Visitors
Troubling innovation: Craft and computing across boundaries,"Craft practices such as needlework, ceramics, and woodworking have long informed and broadened the scope of HCI research. Whether through sewable microcontrollers or programs of small-scale production, they have helped widen the range of people and work recognised as technological and innovative. However, despite this promise, few organisational resources have successfully drawn together the disparate threads of scholarship and practice attending to HCI craft.

In requiring researchers and reviewers to expressly consider the positive and negative consequences of each study, the hope is that our community can earnestly shape more ethical innovation and inquiry. We question whether most researchers have sufficient historical context and awareness of activist movements to recognize crucial impacts to marginalized populations.

Guidelines for human-AI interaction,"Advances in artifcial intelligence (AI) frame opportunities and challenges for user interface design. Principles for human-AI interaction have been discussed in the human-computer interaction community for over two decades, but more study and innovation are needed in light of advances in AI and the growing uses of AI technologies in human-facing applications. We propose 18 generally applicable design guidelines for human-AI interaction. These guidelines are validated through multiple rounds of evaluation including a user study with 49 design practitioners who tested the guidelines against 20 popular AI-infused products. The results verify the relevance of the guidelines over a spectrum of interaction scenarios and reveal gaps in our knowledge, highlighting opportunities for further research. Based on the evaluations, we believe the set of design guidelines can serve as a resource to practitioners working on the design of applications and features that harness AI technologies, and to researchers interested in the further development of guidelines for human-AI interaction design.",Amershi S.; Weld D.; Vorvoreanu M.; Fourney A.; Nushi B.; Collisson P.; Suh J.; Iqbal S.; Bennett P.; Inkpen K.; Teevan J.; Kikin-Gil R.; Horvitz E.,Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2019-05-02,UW College of Engineering;Microsoft Corporation,AI-infused systems ;  Design guidelines ;  Human-AI interaction

Research Outlook of Short-chain Fatty Acids Detected by Ultra Performance Convergence Chromatography,"Gas chromatography (GC) is mainly used to detect the levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), but with the deepening of research, the drawbacks of GC have become more and more obvious in the fields of food, chemical engineering and clinical application. The analysis on existing research results showed that ultra performance convergence chromatography (UPC2) was appropriate for the analysis of lipid metabolism. The UPC is a new kind of chromatographic separation technology developed in recent five years and the level of SCFAs is associated with the research on multiple diseases. Therefore, application of UPC in the detection of SCFAs would be helpful for the scholars at home and abroad to carry out deeper researches, and also helpful to guide the treatment for various metabolic disorders.

GPS signal quality based on short baseline three-antenna common-clock,"In the past 5 years, the innovation technology about the dual-antenna common-clock was promoted and the performance in the relative static platform because the baseline is near 1 meter. The Common clock means that the common crystal oscillator of the GNSS dual receiver sends the same pulse signal simultaneously. The GNSS dual receiver can realize to acquire data synchronously from the different antennas. One benefit of using a common clock reference is that the clock error is the same for all RF signals including carrier phase measurements, and thus it can be removed by forming single differences. It is obvious that the single difference can be optimized and the accuracy of attitude determination can be further improved. So, the common-clock is adopted in more than two GNSS receivers and the carrier phase single difference can get the same technical effects as the double difference. This paper expresses in detail mathematical model method and some experiments, especially for GPS three-antenna short baseline system. The related research work is conducted through the car and UAV platform, such as GPS signal quality, and attitude. It is shown that the performance is more stable in the overall flight situation.",Zhang L.; Zhang C.; Zhang D.; Badenko V.; Garg R.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 4th International Conference on Information Systems Engineering, ICISE 2019",2019-05-01,Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee;East China Normal University;Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University;Sansheng KeHua (Shanghai) Information Technology Co.

Blockchain and sustainability: A systematic mapping study,"Sustainability is a topic of increasing interest. The United Nations has released a list of 17 goals for sustainable development for the global community. Blockchain is a recent technological innovation that shows great promise in changing industries. In this paper, we look specifically at smart grids and supply chain management systems as areas where sustainable technological innovation can happen. To identify software engineering aspects of blockchain in smart grids and supply chain management, we start upon online libraries focusing on engineering and information technology, and we opted for the methodology of systematic mapping studies in software engineering. The search strategy identified 535 papers, of which 60 were identified as main studies for our mapping. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no previous similar studies exist. Results of the study show that the research connecting blockchain technology to smart grids and supply chain management systems is still young. None of the techniques or systems have yet been implemented in a real life setting. As such, more work has to be done before we can look at the actual implications of putting such technologies into use. Software engineering practices could prove to be very useful in the process of development. We propose that future studies can focus on bringing the technologies closer to real life implementations, as well as how to involve the end users in the development of the blockchain-based systems.",Lund E.; Jaccheri L.; Li J.; Cico O.; Bai X.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE/ACM 2nd International Workshop on Emerging Trends in Software Engineering for Blockchain, WETSEB 2019",2019-05-01,Tsinghua University;Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Blockchain ;  Green energy ;  P2P energy trading ;  Smart grids ;  Supply chain management ;  Sustainability ;  UN goals

Open collaborative data-using oss principles to share data in SW engineering,"Reliance on data for software systems engineering is increasing, e.g., to train machine learning applications. We foresee increasing costs for data collection and maintenance, leading to the risk of development budgets eaten up by commodity features, thus leaving little resources for differentiation and innovation. We therefore propose Open Collaborative Data (OCD)-a concept analogous to Open Source Software (OSS)-as a means to share data. In contrast to Open Data (OD), which e.g., governmental agencies provide to catalyze innovation, OCD is shared in open collaboration between commercial organizations, similar to OSS. To achieve this, there is a need for technical infrastructure (e.g., tools for version and access control), licence models, and governance models, all of which have to be tailored for data. However, as data may be sensitive for privacy, anonymization and obfuscation of data is also a research challenge. In this paper, we define the concept of Open Collaborative Data, demonstrate it by map data and image recognition examples, and outline a research agenda for OCD in software engineering as a basis for more efficient evolution of software systems.",Runeson P.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE/ACM 41st International Conference on Software Engineering: New Ideas and Emerging Results, ICSE-NIER 2019",2019-05-01,Lunds Universitet,Open collaborative data ;  Open innovation ;  Open source software
Review on pneumatic-driven structure for soft robot,"Pneumatic actuation is the earliest actuating manner of soft robots.

"Stability analysis of roadway surrounding rock and discussion on the connotation of butterfly failure theory: Responses to ""Discussion on 'A butterfly failure theory of rock mass around roadway and its application prospect'""","In view of readers' queries about the article ""A butterfly failure theory of the rock mass around roadway and its application prospect"" published in this journal 2018 (5), the stability of roadway surrounding rock and the theoretical connotation of butterfly failure were analyzed and discussed. The non-plastic zone or smaller plastic zone of roadway surrounding rock under hydrostatic pressure conforms to the basic cognition. Butterfly failure mode is an objective existence in the surrounding rock of underground engineering holes. The innovation of butterfly failure theory was not to create the butterfly failure or its name, but to take the lead in the new field of research on the characteristics of butterfly failure (including the general laws under the homogeneous conditions and special laws under the heterogeneous conditions). Furthermore, the research results of butterfly failure characteristics were introduced to solve engineering problems, and the physical phenomena associated with various types of disasters in underground engineering were unified into the theoretical framework of butterfly failure. Theory and application of butterfly failure in roadway are original and fundamental, so it is very welcome to question and discuss them. Whether it is verification or falsification, it is beneficial to scientific progress.",Zhao Z.; Ma N.,Journal,Zhongguo Kuangye Daxue Xuebao/Journal of China University of Mining and Technology,2019-05-01,"China University of Mining & Technology, Beijing;Coal Mine Roadway Support and Disaster Prevention Engineering Research Center",Butterfly failure theory ;  Plastic zone radius ;  Roadway ;  Stability of surrounding rock

Systems thinking for early validation of user needs in the front end of innovation; A case study in an offshore SoS,This paper focuses on applying Systems Thinking for early validation of user needs in the front end of innovation for extending an offshore SoS with renewable energy. A high degree of uncertainty and ambiguity characterizes this early phase. Early validation of user needs is assumed to be a key for successful value creation in the early phase development of new systems. The user needs can be difficult to understand and subject to change due to the ambiguous nature of the innovation process. Systems Thinking is a mindset that increases understanding of the system's context and behavior; it helps identifying possible leverage points. This paper applies Systems Thinking methodology in a real case for an industrial project adding renewable energy to offshore installations. We developed in this research graphical presentations to communicate system openness and user needs for the operational phase of the system. The graphical presentations were tested out on stakeholders. We found the Systems Thinking methodology and the graphical presentations to be helpful tools for successful stakeholder communication with the purpose of early validation of user needs.,Kjøarstad M.; Mansouri M.; Muller G.; Kjenner S.,Conference Proceeding,"2019 14th Annual Conference System of Systems Engineering, SoSE 2019",2019-05-01,TechnipFMC plc;University of South-Eastern Norway;Stevens Institute of Technology,Early phase systems engineering ;  Early validation ;  Front end of innovation ;  Renewable energy ;  Systems Thinking ;  User needs
Research skills enhancement through a research-based wit-learning methodology,"A research-based-learning methodology was proposed for the thorough teaching of ongoing topics that would be centered around the students' abilities to apply core technical tools when resolving self-determined research problems. Although the proposed methodology is strongly influenced by the research practice, it was validated principally by the students' objectivity and critical-thinking competencies rather than their acquisition of the required research skills. The present work deals with the assessment of the students' research skills as an outcome of a wit-learning methodology. Specifically, the overall improvement in the quality of their research reports was observed and tracked by the teachers, and their understanding of the research goals and processes was assessed by means of a survey given to them at the beginning and the end of the course. The questions and answers of the surveys were intentionally neither suggested nor discussed during the course so that there could be a valid measurement of the results of the proposed wit-learning methodology. Survey results showed an improvement in the overall alignment (agreement) of the students' understanding of research with that of experienced researchers.",Ibarra L.; Soriano A.; Ponce P.; Molina A.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 2019 20th International Conference on Research and Education in Mechatronics, REM 2019",2019-05-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Educational Innovation ;  Engineering Education ;  Research skills ;  Research-based Learning

Exploring the entrepreneurial intentions of science and engineering students in China: A Q methodology study,"The entrepreneurial intentions of Chinese students have received rapidly evolving attention, with the ""mass entrepreneurship and innovation"" program as a driving force, which encourages individuals to start their own business. Entrepreneurial intention, which is perceived as being a predictor of entrepreneurial behavior, has generally been explored in the existing literature on the basis of the theory of planned behavior and the intention-behavior model. Since intention is a psychological notion, it is important to investigate the motivation for developing entrepreneurial intention from a subjective perspective. The aim of this study is to identify the objective factors that determine Chinese science and engineering students' entrepreneurial intentions, and to understand how these different factors affect their intention to become an entrepreneur. Q methodology, which is a technological combination of qualitative and quantitative research, was conducted using thirty Chinese science and engineering students, and this paper reports their individual attitudes and discourses concerning their entrepreneurial intentions. After compiling 32 Q sets of statements and performing factor analysis, three distinct types of entrepreneurs were revealed. The findings suggest that a subjective approach to entrepreneurship education should be taken to enhance science and engineering students' entrepreneurial intentions. Some theoretical and practical implications of these findings for techno-entrepreneurship education and development are also discussed.",Fang C.; Chen L.,Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2019-05-01,Huaiyin Institute of Technology;Chung Hua University,Entrepreneur ;  Entrepreneurial education ;  Entrepreneurial intention ;  Mixed-methods ;  Q methodology ;  Qualitative
Interdisciplinary methodology to extend technology readiness levels in SONAR simulation from laboratory validation to hydrography demonstrator,"This paper extends underwater SONAR simulation from laboratory prototype to real-world demonstrator. It presents the interdisciplinary methodology to advance the state of the art from level four to level seven on the technology readiness level (TRL) standard scale for measuring the maturity of innovations. While SONAR simulation offers the potential to unlock cost-effective personnel capacity building in hydrography, demonstration of virtualised survey-scale operations is a prerequisite for validation by practitioners. Our research approach uses the TRL framework to identify and map current barriers to the use of simulation to interdisciplinary solutions adapted from multiple domains. To meet the distinct challenges of acceptance tests at each level in the TRL scale, critical knowledge is incorporated from different branches of science, engineering, project management, and pedagogy. The paper reports the simulator development at each escalation of TRL. The contributions to simulator performance and usability at each level of advancement are presented, culminating in the first case study demonstration of SONAR simulation as a real-world hydrographic training platform.",Riordan J.; Flannery F.; Toal D.; Rossi M.; Dooly G.,Journal,Journal of Marine Science and Engineering,2019-05-01,University of the West of Scotland;University of Limerick;SonarSim Ltd.,Acoustics ;  Fractals ;  GPGPU ;  Hydrography ;  Interdisciplinary ;  Level of detail ;  Marine ;  Modelling ;  Multibeam ;  Pedagogy ;  Real-time ;  Robotics ;  Sidescan ;  Simulation ;  Sonar ;  Underwater
Analysis of Damping Ratio in Passive Control Devices with Graded Sand as Fillers in the Shaft Section,"Earthquake resistant design of structures has become a necessity in the present. Various kinds of innovations have been found in making earthquake dampers which are attached to the building structure. This innovation is one of passive control systems that modify the mass and stiffness as well as by adding damping materials to control the dynamic response of the structure due to the influence of lateral forces, one of which is the seismic force. This study focuses on a passive control device that can be added to the structure, which is a composition of rubber layers and steel plates with graded sand as the centre filler. Several previous studies have proved that the rubber has the ability to reduce vibration because of its elasticity. While the sand as choice for additive material based on a grain of sand forms a uniform that cause internal friction between the sand and can produce damping. Research conducted on a passive control device without graded sand as the centre filler and a passive control device with graded sand as the centre filler by using the half power bandwidth method to produce a damping ratio value (ξ). The experimental results showed that the value of the damping ratio of the passive control device with graded sand as the centre filler increased up to 43.94% instead of the passive control device without graded sand as the centre filler.",Christianto D.; Surachmat D.; Leonardy E.; Lim W.; Theodora M.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2019-05-01,Tarumanagara University,damping ratio ;  graded sand ;  passive control device ;  sand ;  the increasing value of damping ratio.
Effect of steel fiber on the shear strength of reactive powder concrete,"Nowadays, research about concrete technology has led to a concrete with high performance (ultra-high concrete). Various innovations are also used to support the ultra-high concrete. In concrete engineering, we always avoid shear failure due to its brittleness. In this study, innovative additives will be used in the form of fiber steel fiber with the aim to increase the shear strength of the concrete powder. Tests in the laboratory will be carried out on samples of fiber-reinforced concrete beam specimens and to study the effect of increasing shear strength due to the addition of fiber (steel fiber), the variable is aspect ratio (fiber length versus fiber diameter) varied 75, 100, 125,165,180 and volume aspects ( 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5%, 0.6%). And the greater the percentage of steel fiber volume can increase the shear strength, the greater the fiber-reinforced concrete, but the workability will be lower. In order for workability to remain good, the recommended fiber volume is 0.3% and the aspect ratio using the critical length of the fiber compared to the diameter of the fiber.",Christianto D.; Tavio T.; Kurniadi D.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2019-05-01,Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember;Tarumanagara University,

Methodology to design ontologies from organizational models: Application to creativity workshops,"Innovation and creativity are a mandatory for companies who wish to stay competitive. In order to promote an inventive dynamic, it implies to set up tools, habits, and an adapted environment to foster creativity. Creativity is the wealth of companies that should be valorized. To promote creativity, companies implement creativity workshops that gather people with various roles and expertise exchange and create knowledge to solve collectively open-ended engineering problems. However, group dynamics or facilitation can make the wrong decision and make the creative problem-solving unfruitful. The aim of our research project is to create a digital system to manage and valorize knowledge during creativity workshops. To design this system, we need to formalize the knowledge domain of creative workshops. The ontologies are used for decades to structure and manage information and knowledge in different domains. However, methodologies to design these ontologies are either hardly reproducible or not oriented to extract knowledge from organization.

Specifying Technology Readiness Levels for the Chemical Industry,"Technology readiness levels (TRLs) have received increasing recognition throughout academia, industry, and policy-making as a tool for evaluating and communicating a technology's maturity. Conventional scales are unspecific to technologies as they aim at evaluating and comparing technologies combining different fields. Hence, they present vague descriptions which leave considerable room for interpretation and subjective choices. For the chemical industry, adaptions and specific criteria are needed for more comprehensible TRL ratings. This paper specifies the nine conventional TRLs for the chemical industry as idea, concept, proof of concept, preliminary process development, detailed process development, pilot trials, demonstration and full-scale engineering, commissioning, and production. Adjusted descriptions and additional criteria with detailed indicators are presented, depicting the logical progression of a typical chemical innovation in the phases of applied research, development, and deployment. The specified TRLs facilitate evaluation and communication of a technology's maturity and substantially improve the basis for data availability-based assessment.",Buchner G.; Stepputat K.; Zimmermann A.; Schomäcker R.,Journal,Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research,2019-05-01,Technische Universität Berlin,
"The Gifted Gap, STEM Education, and Economic Immobility","Systemic inequities in educational opportunities contribute to reduced economic mobility. Extensive research has documented disproportionality in gifted education at national and state levels. However, limited research examines inequities in gifted education within districts. Informed by critical systems theory (CST), this research provides an analysis of the Gifted Gap in a school district serving a growing metropolitan area with surprisingly limited economic mobility. Results reveal underrepresentation of students experiencing poverty, and Black and Latinx students of all socioeconomic groups in gifted education programs. Inequities in gifted education create systemic barriers including reduced enrollment in Advanced Placement (AP) courses, a factor that impedes college completion and participation in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) research and innovation. Reducing gifted education disproportionality is a promising way to increase economic mobility and broaden participation in STEM.",Crabtree L.; Richardson S.; Lewis C.,Journal,Journal of Advanced Academics,2019-05-01,The University of North Carolina at Charlotte,Advanced Placement ;  disproportionality ;  economic mobility ;  gifted education ;  STEM
Tendencies in research on sustainable development in management sciences,"The article aims to analyze scientific research on sustainable development (SD) in the field of management sciences. The main research question (what main trends can be identified in scientific research on SD in management sciences over the years) allowed to formulate six detailed research questions and carry out six partial analyses with the use of bibliometric method according to the following parameters: chronology, discipline, source, center, country and content. The final dataset consisted of articles from scientific journals published in the years 1974–2016. The analysis allowed to draw several conclusions. The dynamics of research on SD in management sciences in chronological terms are growing. The leading scientific areas are environmental science, social science and engineering. Management sciences proved to be an essential area of study. The most important institution contributing to the field is the Dutch Utrecht University. “The Journal of Cleaner Production” should be considered as the most focused journal on this kind of research. In geographical terms, the most prolific regions were American and British. Apart from central areas (SD and sustainability), the other main thematic areas of research are corporate social responsibility, corporate SD, supply chain management, theory of innovation and strategic management. It is worth emphasizing the originality of the research. There are no bibliometric analyses focusing strictly on scientific research on SD in management sciences and presenting a broad spectrum of trends or concentrations in terms of dynamics in time, scientific areas, research centers, journals, countries or thematic areas. Previous analyses tended to be conducted on smaller data sets, consisted of strictly profiled themes and usually included a broader range of documents (including non-scientific ones). The research results can be used by other scholars interested in SD as an inspiration for their own research and for seeking support or cooperation among leading institutions, authors, journals or countries. In addition, the results may facilitate the planning, designing, running and publishing of future research.",Zemigala M.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2019-05-01,Wydział Zarządzania Uniwersytetu Warszawskiego,Bibliometric analysis ;  Research tendencies ;  Sustainable development ;  Sustainable development in management
Students’ perceptions of engineers: dimensionality and influences on career aspiration in engineering,"While many career development theories (e.g., Gottfredson, in: Brown SD, Lent RW (eds), Career development and counseling: Putting theoryand research to work, Wiley, Hoboken, 2005) posit that occupational perceptions are fundamental for understanding youngsters’ career aspirations, research relating school students’ perceptions of engineers and students’ career interest in engineering has been scarce. This study sought to (a) identify the factors underlying the image of engineers to secondary school students, (b) test the invariance of the factors’ measurement model across gender and school years, and (c) examine the hypothesis that the factors mediate the effects of engineering experiences at school on students’ career interest. Data were collected via a questionnaire from a representative sample of 3724 students at Hong Kong. A measurement model with four latent perception factors (innovation and entrepreneurship competencies; aptitudes related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; hands-on work status; and career prestige) fit the responses well and was replicable across gender and school years. Construct validity of the factors was supported by the pattern of their partial mediation effects in the relationship between students’ experiences and their career interest in engineering. The results deepened the understanding of the image of engineers and the image’s influences on students’ career aspiration in engineering. The perception dimensions identified provide a framework useable for engineering education in school.",Chan C.; Yeung N.; Kutnick P.; Chan R.,Journal,International Journal of Technology and Design Education,2019-05-01,King's College London;The University of Hong Kong;Chinese University of Hong Kong,Career choice ;  Engineer image ;  Factor analysis ;  High school ;  Student perception
"Science, technology and innovation studies at a crossroad: SPRU as case study","The setting up of the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU) at Sussex University 50 years ago represented a “transformative change” in the research on science policy and the understanding of the nature and origin of technological change and innovation studies. It influenced policymakers across the world in both the mature Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries and the developing world. It made the topic of science, technology and innovation (STI) familiar to business studies scholars. Today though, the analysis of STI appears to be somewhat in crisis. On the one hand, there is growing evidence that the growth and welfare gains of new technologies and innovation are no longer forthcoming in an automatic “trickle-down” fashion. The knowledge and technology diffusion “machine” appears broken. On the other hand, there are growing environmental concerns about the negative externalities of unsustainable fossil-fuel-based growth as industrialization spreads across the globe. STI policy appears somehow stuck in an industrial efficiency and consumerism mode that is unable to address in a satisfactory way the impact of such negative externalities. Can the broader historical approach as popularized within the so-called Science and Technology Studies (STS) tradition provide additional, complementary insights? Yes, if STI and STS scholars are prepared to leave their respective conceptual comfort zones and address in complementary fashion some of the major societal policy challenges confronting science, technology and innovation policy today.",Soete L.,Journal,Research Policy,2019-05-01,Universiteit Maastricht,Green growth ;  Science policy ;  Societal challenges ;  Technological unemployment ;  Technology and innovation studies ;  Technology diffusion
Towards a holistic innovation policy: Can the Swedish National Innovation Council (NIC) be a role model?,"A holistic innovation policy is defined in this article as a policy that integrates all public actions that influence or may influence innovation processes. The Swedish National Innovation Council (NIC) was created by the Swedish Prime Minister, Stefan Löfven, in February 2015. It is personally chaired by the prime minister. Another atypical characteristic of the Swedish NIC is that it has a dominant and wide focus on innovation policy. In other countries, such councils focus predominantly on science and/or research policy and treat innovation policy, if at all, as an “appendix” to research policy. The purpose of this article is to answer the following four questions: 1. Has Swedish innovation policy recently become more holistic? 2. Has the Swedish National Innovation Council (NIC) had a role in the transition towards a holistic innovation policy? 3. Have conceptual specifications and advancements played a role in the changes in Swedish innovation policy? 4. Can the Swedish NIC serve as a role model for other countries and regions in their attempts to initiate and govern a holistic innovation policy?",Edquist C.,Journal,Research Policy,2019-05-01,Lunds Universitet,Holistic innovation policy ;  Innovation ;  Innovation policy ;  Linear view ;  Research policy ;  Systems of innovation

"Research progress, key scientific problems and countermeasures of “green concentration” technology based on membrane and its integration process","The energy consumption of Chinese materia medica industry is astonishing. The steam consumption of the heavy concentrating section accounts for about 60% of the whole plant, or even higher. Membrane concentration technology has the important advantages of “low energy consumption and low cost”, but it is restricted by the respective defects caused by the technical principles of different membrane processes. Our research group introduces the international advanced integrated design strategy and method in view of the key technology of “reverse osmosis and membrane distillation integration” which is expected to suitable for the concentrated demand of Chinese medicine pharmaceutical industry. Taking the representative Chinese herbal compound prescription as the experimental system, a three-dimensional model of ""time-material rheological characteristics-membrane mass transfer process"" was established by using rheological theory and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) as experimental system and dynamic and precise analysis of technological process. The rheological law of traditional Chinese medicine materials and its influence on membrane concentration process were explored by means of multi-disciplinary methods. The mass transfer effect and mechanism of membrane concentration process on traditional Chinese medicine materials were elaborated. The equilibrium points of critical osmotic pressure (RO process) and critical flux (membrane distillation process) were found. The optimal combination schemes of reverse osmosis (RO) and membrane distillation (MD) were explored. In short, we solved the key technical problems of the membrane concentration process, which provided support for the complete set of technical equipment and the technological design, and promoted the theoretical and technological innovation of TCM pharmaceutical engineering.",Pan L.; Li B.; Guo L.; Zhang L.; Shi F.; Yang C.; Jin T.,Journal,Chinese Traditional and Herbal Drugs,2019-04-28,Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine,Chinese materia medica pharmaceutical engineering ;  Computational fluid dynamics ;  Concentration ;  Membrane and integration process ;  Rheology
Research Advances in Long-Life of Worldwide Bridges and Corresponding Reflections,"In order to better satisfy the higher requirements of society for the carrying and traffic capacity of existing bridges, we systematically researched the long-term service of bridges at home and abroad. Due to the different starting points of rapid economic development, the problem of aging of bridges is first put much value on in developed industrialized countries. In recent years, researchers from countries and regions such as Europe, America, and Japan have focused on the extension of the life of bridges and maintenance of long-term performance of bridges. On the basis of summarizing the results of foreign researches, we analyzed the durability and safety status of bridges in China, and put forward principle proposals for carrying out research on the long-term service of bridges in China as follows: due to a huge amount of existing bridges and current service status in China, it is necessary to carry out theoretical and technological researches on long-life bridges in advance which are guided by scientific and technological innovation; the maintenance and repair strategy of bridges should be updated in order to improve the durability and safety of existing bridges, to maintain or extend the service life, to save the investment, and to promote the advancement of bridge design, thus the maintenance reinforcement theory and technology can be promoted.",Li Y.; Wang C.,Journal,Bridge Construction,2019-04-28,Southwest Jiaotong University,Applicability ;  Bridge engineering ;  Durability ;  Economy ;  Long life ;  Maintenance method ;  Safety
The impact of innovation and technology investments on carbon emissions in selected organisation for economic Co-operation and development countries,"Countries belonging to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) are among those with the highest level of carbon emissions in the world. Following negotiations, OECD members resolved to heighten and support innovation and technology investments in the public and private sectors aimed at reducing carbon emissions. This study conducted a system-Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) analysis to investigate how innovation and technology investments influence carbon emissions in selected OECD economies from 2000 to 2014. Using data from the OECD database and the World Development Indicators (World Bank database), it employed four proxies of innovation and technology investments, namely, renewable energy consumption, the number of researchers, spending on research and development and the number of triadic patent families. The results indicated that, after applying the dynamic model and controlling for endogeneity, renewable energy consumption and spending on research and development have a statistically significant negative relationship with carbon emissions. The number of triadic patent families illustrates a positive and significant relationship with carbon emissions, but in the case of the number of researchers, the relationship was positive but not significant. Overall, this suggests that innovation and technology investments in these countries affect emissions differently and still have the potential to reduce environmental quality. It is concluded that ensuring that patents include natural environmental standard specifications and that researchers are better equipped with green skills and knowledge would enhance the achievement of zero-emission targets.",Ganda F.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2019-04-20,Walter Sisulu University,Carbon emissions ;  Innovation and technology investments ;  Number of researchers ;  Number of triadic patent families ;  Renewable energy consumption ;  Spending on research and development
Sustainability Challenges in Peptide Synthesis and Purification: From R&D to Production,"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in therapeutic peptides within the pharmaceutical industry with more than 50 peptide drugs on the market, approximately 170 in clinical trials, and >200 in preclinical development. However, the current state of the art in peptide synthesis involves primarily legacy technologies with use of large amounts of highly hazardous reagents and solvents and little focus on green chemistry and engineering. In 2016, the ACS Green Chemistry Institute Pharmaceutical Roundtable identified development of greener processes for peptide API as a critical unmet need, and as a result, a new Roundtable team formed to address this important area. The initial focus of this new team is to highlight best practices in peptide synthesis and encourage much needed innovations. In this Perspective, we aim to summarize the current challenges of peptide synthesis and purification in terms of sustainability, highlight possible solutions, and encourage synergies between academia, the pharmaceutical industry, and contract research organizations/contract manufacturing organizations.",Isidro-Llobet A.; Kenworthy M.; Mukherjee S.; Kopach M.; Wegner K.; Gallou F.; Smith A.; Roschangar F.,Journal,Journal of Organic Chemistry,2019-04-19,"Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;Eli Lilly and Company;GlaxoSmithKline plc.;Novartis International AG;Ipsen;AstraZeneca;Bristol-Myers Squibb;Amgen Incorporated",

Cellular Based Strategies for Microvascular Engineering,"Vascularization is a major hurdle in complex tissue and organ engineering. Tissues greater than 200 μm in diameter cannot rely on simple diffusion to obtain nutrients and remove waste. Therefore, an integrated vascular network is required for clinical translation of engineered tissues. Microvessels have been described as <150 μm in diameter, but clinically they are defined as <1 mm. With new advances in super microsurgery, vessels less than 1 mm can be anastomosed to the recipient circulation. However, this technical advancement still relies on the creation of a stable engineered microcirculation that is amenable to surgical manipulation and is readily perfusable. Microvascular engineering lays on the crossroads of microfabrication, microfluidics, and tissue engineering strategies that utilize various cellular constituents. Early research focused on vascularization by co-culture and cellular interactions, with the addition of angiogenic growth factors to promote vascular growth. Since then, multiple strategies have been utilized taking advantage of innovations in additive manufacturing, biomaterials, and cell biology. However, the anatomy and dynamics of native blood vessels has not been consistently replicated. Inconsistent results can be partially attributed to cell sourcing which remains an enigma for microvascular engineering. Variations of endothelial cells, endothelial progenitor cells, and stem cells have all been used for microvascular network fabrication along with various mural cells. As each source offers advantages and disadvantages, there continues to be a lack of consensus. Furthermore, discord may be attributed to incomplete understanding about cell isolation and characterization without considering the microvascular architecture of the desired tissue/organ.",Koduru S.; Leberfinger A.; Pasic D.; Forghani A.; Lince S.; Hayes D.; Ozbolat I.; Ravnic D.,Journal,Stem Cell Reviews and Reports,2019-04-15,Penn State College of Engineering;Penn State College of Medicine;Penn State Health Milton S.

Highly stretchable sensors for wearable biomedical applications,"Highly stretchable supersensitive sensors represent a new epoch in the field of intelligent medical devices. Applications include the detection of various stimuli of the human body and environmental monitoring around biological surfaces. To provide more accurate measurement results, stretchable sensors must be tightly attached on the skin surface or to clothing. Consequently, stretchable sensors must fulfill many requirements, such as high stretchability, high comfortability, high sensitivity, and long-term wear. To address these challenges, investigators have devoted considerable research effort to the development of technology, and much progress has been achieved. Here, recent developments with stretchable sensors are described, including human motion monitoring sensors, vital sign monitoring sensors, and sensors for environmental monitoring around biological surfaces. The latest successful examples of supersensitive sensors for achieving stretchability by novel materials or structures are reviewed. In the next section, recent advances regarding processing technology innovations are introduced. Future research directions and challenges in developing a highly stretchable supersensitive sensor for wearable biomedical applications are also discussed. With the development of new materials and novel technologies, and given the interdisciplinary nature of the research, the functionalities of stretchable sensors will become more powerful, and stretchable sensor technology will become more mature.",Gao Q.; Zhang J.; Xie Z.; Omisore O.; Zhang J.; Wang L.; Li H.,Journal,Journal of Materials Science,2019-04-15,Shenzhen Technology University;Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology;Nanjing University,
FAST<sup>2</sup>: An intelligent assistant for finding relevant papers,Literature reviews are essential for any researcher trying to keep up to date with the burgeoning software engineering literature. Finding relevant papers can be hard due to the huge amount of candidates provided by search. FAST2 is a novel tool for assisting the researchers to find the next promising paper to read. This paper describes FAST2 and tests it on four large systematic literature review datasets. We show that FAST2 robustly optimizes the human effort to find most (95%) of the relevant software engineering papers while also compensating for the errors made by humans during the review process. The effectiveness of FAST2 can be attributed to three key innovations: (1) a novel way of applying external domain knowledge (a simple two or three keyword search) to guide the initial selection of papers—which helps to find relevant research papers faster with less variances; (2) an estimator of the number of remaining relevant papers yet to be found—which helps the reviewer decide when to stop the review; (3) a novel human error correction algorithm—which corrects a majority of human misclassifications (labeling relevant papers as non-relevant or vice versa) without imposing too much extra human effort.,Yu Z.; Menzies T.,Journal,Expert Systems with Applications,2019-04-15,NC State College of Engineering,Active learning ;  Literature reviews ;  Relevance feedback ;  Selection process ;  Semi-supervised learning ;  Text mining
Teaching Responsible Research and Innovation: A Phronetic Perspective,"Across the European research area and beyond, efforts are being mobilized to align research and innovation processes and products with societal values and needs, and to create mechanisms for inclusive priority setting and knowledge production. A central concern is how to foster a culture of “Responsible Research and Innovation” (RRI) among scientists and engineers. This paper focuses on RRI teaching at higher education institutions. On the basis of interviews and reviews of academic and policy documents, it highlights the generic aspects of teaching aimed at invoking a sense of care and societal obligation, and provides a set of exemplary cases of RRI-related teaching. It argues that the Aristotelian concept of phronesis can capture core properties of the objectives of RRI-related teaching activities. Teaching should nurture the students’ capacity in terms of practical wisdom, practical ethics, or administrative ability in order to enable them to act virtuously and responsibly in contexts which are often characterized by uncertainty, contention, and controversy.",Mejlgaard N.; Christensen M.; Strand R.; Buljan I.; Carrió M.; Cayetano i Giralt M.; Griessler E.; Lang A.; Marušić A.; Revuelta G.; Rodríguez G.; Saladié N.; Wuketich M.,Journal,Science and Engineering Ethics,2019-04-15,"School of Medicine, University of Split;Universitat Pompeu Fabra Barcelona;Universitetet i Bergen;Aarhus Universitet;Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona;Institut für Höhere Studien, Vienna",Phronesis ;  Responsible Research and Innovation ;  RRI teaching
Improving inclusivity and diversity in college STEM programs through metacognitive classroom practices,"We report on results from RIT's Project IMPRESS: Integrating Metacognitive Practices to Ensure Student Success, a 5-year NSF funded program to improve retention of first-generation and deaf/hard-of-hearing students in STEM disciplines. As part of IMPRESS, we have developed and taught a first-year course ""Metacognitive Approaches to Scientific Inquiry."" The course, which satisfies the Institute's Ethical Perspectives requirement, introduces students to a variety of metacognitive issues and practices including: Developing a growth mindset; Bloom's and Perry's taxonomies for content and intellectual development; inaccuracy in self-assessment; lateral and longitudinal transfer of knowledge and experiences; and the benefits of self-reflection. Over 200 students in five years have taken the course, with very promising results. Retention of IMPRESS 1st-generation and DHH students into their 2nd, 3rd and 4th year are all above 80%, at or exceeding the institutional average. IMPRESS student demographics are inclusive: 35% are women; 32% from identities historically excluded from STEM disciplines; and 17% Deaf or Hard of Hearing (DHH). Retention results are consistent across these demographics. In qualitative research focus groups students consistently report IMPRESS experiences as lifechanging. Students recognize that issues and strategies learned in the class can be used in their other classes and that this class essentially teaches them ""how to learn."" Students also report great appreciation for a class in which disciplinary faculty (as opposed to academic or student support staff) demonstrate meaningful care for students as humans. Additionally, a quantitative study comparing IMPRESS students with a matched group of non-IMPRESS 1st-generation/DHH students found that IMPRESS students were more likely to report satisfaction with their choice of RIT as an institution. In this paper we describe the curricular innovations that comprise the foundations of the Metacognition course and the latest analyses of retention and student satisfaction.",Hane E.; Franklin S.,Conference Proceeding,CoNECD 2019 - Collaborative Network for Engineering and Computing Diversity,2019-04-14,Rochester Institute of Technology,1st generation ;  Disability ;  Gender ;  Undergraduate
Exploring faculty perceptions of students characteristics at hispanic serving institutions,"The creation of a diverse STEM workforce has been the target of multiple initiatives that seek to broaden the participation of underrepresented minorities. Hispanic/Latinx students represent a small fraction of undergraduate engineering students, and more than half obtain their undergraduate degrees from Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs). Focusing efforts at these institutions has the potential to increase significantly the representation of the Latinx population in engineering. This study is part of a broader effort to identify needs and successes at existing HSIs by actively engaging with engineering educators through the use of design thinking methodologies. This paper aims to further the understanding of how educators at HSIs perceive their undergraduate students, including their assets and needs. Thirty-six engineering educators from 13 HSIs in Arizona, Florida, New Mexico, and Texas attended one of two workshops in the spring of 2018. Participants engaged in individual and group activities that helped them reflect on their students and actively design an educational innovation for their institution, using information previously gathered through interviews with students. Qualitative analysis of the data across the thirty-six educators at both workshops identified differences between how instructors describe characteristics of Latinx engineering students across regions and instructor type. The overall findings provide a set of unique characteristics of students at HSIs that can serve as the foundation for future research and future educational efforts to increase the representation of Latinx students in engineering.",Kendall M.; Strong A.; Basalo I.; Henderson G.,Conference Proceeding,CoNECD 2019 - Collaborative Network for Engineering and Computing Diversity,2019-04-14,University of Miami;Florida International University;The University of Texas at El Paso,Engineering ;  Faculty ;  Race/ethnicity ;  Undergraduate
Advanced Functional Fibrous Materials for Enhanced Thermoregulating Performance,"The concept of thermoregulating textiles capable of providing personal thermal management property (PTM) has attracted significant attention in recent years. It is considered as an emerging approach to promote the comfort and general well-being of wearers and also to mitigate the energy consumption load for indoor living space conditioning. Regulating the heat exchange between human body and environment has been the core subject of many studies on introducing the PTM functionality to textiles. This work provides an overview of the latest literature, summarizing the recent innovations and state-of-the-art approaches of controlling the heat gain and loss of textiles. To this end, methods to control the fundamental aspects of heat gain and loss of fabrics such as using near-infrared reflective materials and conductive nanomaterials, designing photonic structures of fabrics, and engineering nanoporous structures for passive cooling and heating effects will be discussed. Moreover, specific attention is given to the application of phase change materials in textiles, their integration methods, and the associated mechanisms. Several commercial methods such as adapting the innovative designs, introducing moisture management capability, and using air/liquid thermoregulating systems will also be discussed.

The field of Engineering Optics employs optical theories to practical applications in a broad range of areas. However, the foundation of traditional Engineering Optics was formed several hundred years ago, and the field has developed only very gradually. With technological innovations in both the fabrication and characterization of microstructures, the past few decades have witnessed many groundbreaking changes to the bases of optics, including the generalizing of refraction, reflection, diffraction, radiation and absorption theories. These new theories enable us to break through the barriers in traditional optical technologies, yielding revolutionary advances in traditional optical systems such as microscopes, telescopes and lithography systems.",Luo X.,Book,"Engineering Optics 2.0 A Revolution in Optical Theories, Materials, Devices and Systems",2019-04-10,Institute of Optics and Electronics Chinese Academy of Sciences,
Trends in preparing cyber-physical systems engineers,"Demand for prepared Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) engineers is growing in the Industry 4.0 economy and universities should respond accordingly. This article identifies trends in preparing the CPSs workforce of the future by reviewing educational curricula and research on CPSs of universities around the world. The research finds three main approaches being deployed: 1) Offering universal CPSs foundational training for different industrial fields; 2) becoming more focus on CPSs training at the doctoral level and for a specific industrial field; and 3) CPSs training as an embedded or introduction course in engineering curricula.

Almost all disciplines of science and engineering, as well as social sciences, involve multimedia data in some forms, such as recording experiments, driverless cars, unmanned aerial vehicles, smart communities, biomedical instruments, security surveillance. Some recent events demonstrate the power of real-Time broadcast of unfolding events on social networks. Multimedia data is not just big in volume, but also multi-modal and mostly unstructured. Storing, indexing, searching, integrating, and recognizing from the vast amounts of data create unprecedented challenges. Even though significant progress has been made processing multimedia data, today's solutions are inadequate in handling data from millions of sources simultaneously. The IEEE International Conference on Multimedia Information Processing and Retrieval (IEEE-MIPR) aims to provide a forum for original research contributions and practical system design, implementation, and applications of multimedia information processing and retrieval for single modality or multiple modalities. The target audiences are university researchers, scientists, industry practitioners, software engineers, and graduate students who want to become acquainted with technologies for big data analytics, machine intelligence, information fusion in multimedia information processing and retrieval. Following a successful debut in Miami, Florida in 2018, the second MIPR, held in San Jose, California, attracted over 140 submissions and more than 100 attendees-A big growth from its inaugural event and an indication of its growing visibility and popularity in the multimedia research society. In addition to four keynote talks, MIPR'19 also featured six innovation multimedia forums organized by both academic and industrial researchers, with topics ranging from computer vision, self-driving, Natural Language Processing, next generation video display, to cutting edge video/audio coding techniques.",Su G.; Zhang C.; Wang H.; Chen M.; Kankanhalli M.; Lienhart R.,Journal,IEEE Multimedia,2019-04-01,Department of Computer Science;Dolby Laboratories;National University of Singapore;University of Washington-Bothell;Universität Augsburg;TCL Corporation,
Cloud computing research profiling: Mapping scholarly community and identifying thematic boundaries of the field,"The aim of the study was to map the scholarly community interested in research on cloud computing and to identify thematic boundaries of the field. The methodology of research profiling, representing bibliometric descriptive studies, was applied to achieve the aim of the study. Using research profiling for mapping the cloud computing field can be considered as an innovation. Although the research profiling methodology has been widely used across various subject areas, including Computer Science, Social Sciences, Engineering, Arts and Humanities, Business, Management and Accounting, and Psychology, thus far neither Scopus norWeb of Science indexed publications including the conjunction of phrases ""cloud computing"" and ""research profiling"" in their titles, keywords and abstracts. The previous important scientometric study of the research output in the field was published by Heilig and Voß in 2014. Taking into account a very dynamic growth of the field, all this indicates the research gap to be filled. The research sample is made of 14,158 publications indexed in Scopus database comprising the phrase ""cloud computing"" in their titles. The study was purposely limited to the title search to concentrate the attention of publications relating directly to the issue of cloud computing. Applying the quantitative approach provides an opportunity for broad scanning of subject-related literature. First, general publication profiling recognized the main contributors (countries, research intuitions, source titles and authors) to the scholarly community interested in cloud computing. Secondly, subject area profiling was applied to find how multidisciplinary is the research in the field and how the research output is distributed across subject areas. Finally, topic profiling unveiled leading topics of studies in the field and their distribution by authors, journal, subject areas and core references.",Sudolska A.; Lis A.; Błaś R.,Journal,Social Sciences,2019-04-01,Uniwersytet Mikołaja Kopernika w Toruniu,Cloud computing; bibliometrics; research profiling
"Translation of bone wax and its substitutes: History, clinical status and future directions","Bone wax, primarily composed of beeswax and softening agent, is a century-old material used to control bleeding of disrupted bone surfaces by acting as a mechanical barrier to seal the wound. The current bone wax products are commonly packed in easy-to-open foil in the form of sterile sticks or plates, with excellent malleability and smooth consistency, enabling cost-effective and easy handling approach for bleeding control. It has also been reported that the inert nature of bone wax causes complications including foreign body reaction, infection promotion and bone healing inhibition. With the advances in biomaterials and the market boost of bone haemostatic materials, the arena of bone wax substitute research has expanded to a wide spectrum of material formulations and forms. However, the development of substitutes of bone wax for translation is a pivotal yet challenging topic because currently a potential candidate is recommended to be just as simple to use, effective and inexpensive to produce as traditional bone wax but also be absorbable and osteogenic. This review provides an overview of bone wax including its history, clinical applications and associated complication. In addition, emerging substitutes of bone wax and outlooks of future directions including the standardised evaluation methods are also discussed as an effort to catalyse the innovation and translation of bone haemostatic agents in the near future. The translational potential of this article: Occurrence of osseous haemorrhage is common in surgically incised or traumatically fractured bone. It is essential to stop bone bleeding to avoid further pathologic consequences such as tissue necrosis and eventually mortalities due to blood loss. Medical sterile bone wax is a classical material for haemostasis of bone during orthopaedic surgeries, thoracic surgeries, neurological surgeries and so on. Along with its widespread use, complications such as foreign body reaction, bone healing inhibition and infection promotion associated with bone wax are observed. With the growing knowledge in biomaterials and the boost of market of bone haemostatic materials, bone wax substitute research is thriving. An overview of bone and its substitutes together with evolution of their design criteria is carried out in this work, providing information for the innovation and translation of bone haemostatic agents in the near future.",Zhou H.; Ge J.; Bai Y.; Liang C.; Yang L.,Journal,Journal of Orthopaedic Translation,2019-04-01,The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University;Jiangsu University of Technology;Hebei University of Technology;International Research Center for Translational Orthopaedics (IRCTO),Biocompatible materials ;  Bone regeneration ;  Bone wax ;  Haemostatic
"The birth of space oceanography: Technological questions and climatological opportunity (United States, France, 1950–1980)","This article analyzes the formation of space oceanography as a scientific specialty, in France and in the United States. Throughout much of its history, oceanography has relied upon a broad range of instrumentation (bathyscaphes, tide gauges, and so forth). The importance of instrumentation meant that many of the exchanges during major scientific meetings in the 1960s focused on engineering problems. As a result, institutional investments by NASA and the French space agency, the Centre National d’Études Spatiales (CNES) supported advances in instrumentation. The emergence of the climate change issue made it possible to merge several factors (technical, geopolitical, and institutional) into the specialty of space oceanography. The birth of a scientific specialty requires the conjunction of several determining factors: a powerful disciplinary basis, a technological innovation resulting in major advances, and scientific politicians capable of tackling new problems. The development of space oceanography provides an excellent example of the origin of a new scientific specialty. The purpose of this article is to trace the history of the combination of the technical and scientific factors that resulted in the origin of space oceanography. This article will focus on specific events that led to the origin of space oceanography, in particular on a series of meetings organized by researchers interested in very specific technical questions. Many of the classical questions of oceanography could be addressed and dealt with by developing and using new instruments (e.g. radar altimeters). To document how the specialty of space oceanography developed, I propose to follow American and French examples of the transformations induced by space oceanography. Such a comparison makes it possible to measure the differential scientific ‘maturity’ of a nascent speciality. The emergence of climate change research, starting in the 1970s, reorganized many of the oceanographic research questions and legitimized the extension of the discipline into geospatial research. One goal of this article is to understand how this development of science policy influenced interactions between different disciplines.",Lamy J.,Journal,Earth Sciences History,2019-04-01,Université Toulouse - Jean Jaurès,France ;  Oceanography ;  Satellites ;  Space ;  United States of America

"Government programs for university-industry partnerships: Logics, design, and implications for academic science","Canada's research policy over the past three decades has steered national science toward industrial innovation. Yet, the outcomes of this policy orientation are debatable. Macro-level indicators continue to show weak performance in firm innovation, and there is also evidence that this policy stance has had material effects on science at the meso and micro levels. If so much public investment has gone into harnessing university-industry collaborations for a substantial period of time, why has Canada not seen an uptick in innovative activity? To address this puzzle, we turned our gaze to the policy machinery that promotes academic-industrial collaboration. We carried out case studies of two long-standing federal programs supporting research and development activities between universities and industry. Both programs are administered by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), Canada's largest funder of natural sciences and engineering research. Drawing from multiple sources of data, we find that underneath the apparently successful implementation of these programs lies a misalignment between micro- and meso-level incentives for collaboration, and macro-level policy goals related to technological innovation and economic renewal. Our article makes two main contributions. First, it calls into question the escalating federal investments in university-industry partnership programs, as long as their ability to meet operational milestones remains the main source of evaluation. Second, it demonstrates the relevance and need for the literature to go beyond a focus on narrow technical questions at the micro level, and address broader questions about the purpose, goals, and beneficiaries of university-industry collaboration policy.",Veletanlić E.; Sá C.,Journal,Research Evaluation,2019-04-01,University of Toronto,Canada ;  innovation ;  research policy ;  technology transfer ;  university-industry partnerships
Chromatin research and biological engineering: an evolving relationship poised for new biomedical impacts,"Recent work at the interface of biomedical engineering and chromatin research suggests that cell engineers are approaching the biochemically complex, protein-packaged eukaryotic genome with less trepidation and greater enthusiasm. Landmark discoveries, such as the connection between cell phenotype and chromatin features, and how these features are generated have paved the way toward chromatin engineering. Modular DNA sequences and fusion proteins can be used to protect synthetic DNA from undesirable regulation. Now, transgenes no longer lie completely at the mercy of native chromatin. Synthetic systems are also being used to produce mechanistic data. These data, plus information from descriptive profiling and associative studies, are converging upon a new investigative paradigm to solve puzzles of causality and enable chromatin-focused biomedical innovations.",Haynes K.,Journal,Current Opinion in Systems Biology,2019-04-01,Wallace H.

Benefits of genome-edited crops: expert opinion,"Innovation in agriculture is pervasive. However, in spite of the success stories of twentieth century plant breeding, the twenty-first century has ushered in a set of challenges that solutions from the past century are unlikely to address. However, sustained research and the amalgamation of a number of disciplines has resulted in new breeding techniques (NBTs), such as genome editing, which offer the promise of new opportunities to resolve some of the issues. Here we present the results of an expert survey on the added potential benefits of genome-edited crops compared to those developed through genetic modification (GM) and conventional breeding. Overall, survey results reveal a consensus among experts on the enhanced agronomic performance and product quality of genome-edited crops over alternatives. The majority of experts indicated that the regulations for health and safety, followed by export markets, consumers, and the media play a major role in determining where and how NBTs, including genome editing, will be developed and used in agriculture. Further research is needed to gauge expert opinion after the Court of Justice of the European Union ruling establishing that site-specific mutagenic breeding technologies are to be regulated in the same fashion as GM crops, regardless of whether foreign DNA is present in the final variety.",Lassoued R.; Macall D.; Hesseln H.; Phillips P.; Smyth S.,Journal,Transgenic Research,2019-04-01,University of Saskatchewan,Agricultural biotechnology ;  Conventional crops ;  Genetically modified crops ;  Innovation ;  New breeding techniques ;  Regulation
Uncovering the sequential patterns in transformative and non-transformative discourse during collaborative inquiry learning,"Many universities are using computer-supported collaborative-inquiry-learning (CSCiL) environments to develop their students' skills in collaboration, problem solving, and critical thinking. Diverse states of discourse during CSCiL occur in sequences, but we do not yet fully understand which patterns are beneficial to learning and when exactly to foster them. This study used transition-rate analysis, entropy-analysis, and sequential pattern mining to analyze the chat message of 144 students of two-year colleges. The participants worked on tasks related to Ohm's Law in a simulation-based collaborative-inquiry-learning environment. The results revealed that students in groups who completed tasks successfully tended to ensure that everyone in their group had a shared understanding of the relationship between the variables before they moved on to the next step. In contrast, students in groups who did not complete tasks successfully were more likely to regulate the process without reaching a shared understanding.

"Microgels: Modular, tunable constructs for tissue regeneration","Biopolymer microgels are emerging as a versatile tool for aiding in the regeneration of damaged tissues due to their biocompatible nature, tunable microporous structure, ability to encapsulate bioactive factors, and tailorable properties such as stiffness and composition. These properties of microgels, along with their injectability, have allowed for their utilization in a multitude of different tissue engineering applications. Controlled release of growth factors, antibodies, and other bioactive factors from microgels have demonstrated their capabilities as transporters for essential bioactive molecules necessary for guiding tissue reconstruction. Additionally, recent in vitro studies of cellular interaction and proliferation within microgel structures have laid the initial groundwork for regenerative tissue engineering using these materials. Microgels have even been crosslinked together in various ways or 3D printed to form three-dimensional scaffolds to support cell growth. In vivo studies of microgels have pioneered the clinical relevance of these novel and innovative materials for regenerative tissue engineering. This review will cover recent developments and research of microgels as they pertain to bioactive factor release, cellular interaction and proliferation in vitro, and tissue regeneration in vivo. Statement of Significance: This review is focused on state-of-the-art microgel technology and innovations within the tissue engineering field, focusing on the use of microgels in bioactive factor delivery and as cell-interactive scaffolds, both in vitro and in vivo. Microgels are hydrogel microparticles that can be tuned based on the biopolymer from which they are derived, the crosslinking chemistry used, and the fabrication method. The emergence of microgels for tissue regeneration applications in recent years illuminates their versatility and applicability in clinical settings.",Newsom J.; Payne K.; Krebs M.,Journal,Acta Biomaterialia,2019-04-01,University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus;Colorado School of Mines,Biopolymers ;  Drug delivery ;  Microgels ;  Regenerative medicine ;  Tissue engineering

Towards a segmentation of science parks: A typology study on science parks in Europe,"Although science parks are established globally for decades as an innovation policy instrument to foster growth and networking, there is limited attention given towards research into possible types within these real estate objects. Prior attempts in categorising science parks are characterised by the limited number of cases and/or variables. Science parks are believed to enhance innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic value for firms and regions. Past academic research showed mixed results on these performances and it is reasoned that distinct types within science parks exist that might explain these unclear results. We argue that before we can grasp what science parks can do, we should know what they are. Therefore, a survey on science park characteristics was completed by 82 science park managers in Europe. A cluster analysis was conducted which grouped the 82 participating science parks in three types; ‘research’, ‘cooperative’, and ‘incubator’ locations. Next, differences and similarities of these three types within science parks in Europe were analysed as a basis for advancing the academic debate. The types provide further understanding of science parks and offer researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers a means to compare, market, and benchmark science parks more adequately.",Ng W.; Appel-Meulenbroek R.; Cloodt M.; Arentze T.,Journal,Research Policy,2019-04-01,Technische Universiteit Eindhoven,Cluster analysis ;  Europe ;  Innovation policy ;  Science park ;  Segmentation

An Integrated Approach Based on ANP and Goal Programming to Determine the Best Marketing Strategy,"This study aims to build an integrated model to choose the best marketing strategy. The proposed model uses Analytic Network Process (ANP) and Goal Programming. The selection of the best marketing strategy is the process of multiple criteria decision making which involves many criteria and alternatives. Criteria considered in this study include consistent, cost, customer loyalty, trend following, business volume, unique, customer numbers, promotion, branding, business network, outlet location, credibility, manpower and innovation. While alternative marketing strategies include cost leadership, differentiation, focus (segmentation), people and place. ANP methodology is useful to build the interrelationships among criteria and alternatives in marketing strategy selection and to determine the weight of each criterion and alternatives. Goal programming is used to choose the best marketing strategy by considering the constraints and parameters that are suitable for the conditions in SMEs. The application of this model is conducted on one of the largest Batik SMEs in Pamekasan, Madura. The results of the research show that the focus strategy was chosen as the best strategy for Batik Madura SMEs.",Deefi Anna I.; Cahyadi I.; Yakin A.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2019-03-29,Universitas Trunojoyo Madura,analytic network process (ANP) ;  goal programming ;  marketing strategy ;  multiple criteria decision making

A brief review of the 40 years science popularization development in China,"This article presents a brief review of China's science popularization over the past 40 year since the reform and opening up in terms of the development history, main achievements and main challenges. The development of science popularization has consisted of four main stages: institutional reconstruction, structural maturity, regulatory boost of legal system, and comprehensively strategic ascension. Over the past 40 years, China's science popularization has many achievements, such as the formation of science popularization social mobilization mechanism led by the government with public engagement; the continuous improvement of the position of science popularization in the national strategy; the establishment of a relatively systematic science popularization policy system; the constant increase of the science popularization supporting funds; the steady development of science popularization talents; the richer science popularization resources in the mass media; the improvement of science popularization's informatization level; the gradual strength of the national science popularization ability; the continual increase of the civic scientific literacy and the public's supporting for the development of science and technology. It provides a solid social foundation for science and technology innovation. At the same time, China's science popularization is also facing certain challenges, including the strategic position of science popularization needs to be declared, the development of science popularization and science innovation are still unbalanced, the effectiveness of science popularization policy needs to be improved, the role of long-term operational mechanism is insufficient, international development lags behind and calls for more open cooperation, science popularization theoretical research needs to be strengthened, the support for science culture construction is weak, and the systematic coordination needs to be improved. It is emphasized that the government attaching great importance to science popularization is a key factor to develop. In the future, under the impetus of the government, it is necessary to realize the opening and improvement of the civic scientific literacy with internationalization, plan for the open cooperation of science with a global perspective, form a strong synergy in the construction of civic science literacy, and establish a long-term mechanism for science popularization; reshape the service pattern of civic scientific literacy construction with informatization and build a ""smart science popularization"" service platform, etc. Science popularization in China is on the right track to even greater flourishing.",Ren F.,Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2019-03-25,National Academy of Innovation Strategy,Science and technology innovation ;  Science popularization ;  Science popularization policy ;  Scientific literacy
Impacts of business model design on innovation performance in medium and small sci-tech enterprises: Moderating effects of dual technology innovation strategy,"It is of great theoretical and practical significance to study the relationship and influence mechanism between business model design and innovation performance based on medium and small sci-tech enterprises in China. This paper analyzes the impact of two types of business model design on the innovation performance in medium and small sci-tech enterprises through empirical research method, and discusses the moderating effect of the dual technology innovation strategy on the relationship between the two above. The results show that the novel business model design and the efficient business model design have a significant positive impact on the innovation performance; there is no evidence that the moderating effects of exploitative technology innovation strategy exist, while the exploratory technology innovation strategy has the moderating effect, which has a significant positive impact on the relationship between novel business model design and innovation performance and has a significant negative impact on the relationship between efficient business model design and innovation performance. This paper is not only the expansion and continuation of the relevant empirical research of the business model, but also having important guiding significance for the practice of medium and small sci-tech enterprises.",Wang Y.; Shi L.; Jin M.,Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2019-03-23,Xidian University,Business model design ;  Exploration and exploitation ;  Innovation performance ;  Novelty and efficiency ;  Technology innovation strategy

Optimization of coating process parameters for bionic drag reduction and efficiency increasing coating of centrifugal pumps,"Bionics is based on the structure of natural biological system and the process of life activities as the basis of technological innovation and design, and consciously imitates and replicates it. Through the coupling of 2 or more different factors, organisms can effectively realize various functional characteristics of organisms and fully display their best adaptability to habitats,this phenomenon of biological coupling is ubiquitous in the biological world. The multi-bionics of learning and simulating the coupling mechanism of organisms is called coupling bionics. The drag reduction mechanism of dolphin skin is a typical representative of the bio-binary coupling. Dolphin skin is composed of smooth elastic keraphyllous epidermis and hard dermis, which are intertwined with each other. The coupling effect of the 2 parts is one of the main reasons why dolphins can swim fast. According to the principle of bionic similarity, Jilin University has designed a coupling functional surface which imitates the skin structure of dolphins, and applied it to the surface of the key parts (centrifugal impeller) of centrifugal pump, which can significantly improve the pump efficiency. The specific method is to directly cast the ribbed structure similar to the dolphin skin dermis on the upper and lower cover plate of impeller by one-step casting technology, and then coat the cover plate with high viscous polyurethane as the surface material. The ribbed structure at the bottom and the polyurethane coating on the surface constitute a coupling bionic functional surface. The thickness parameters of surface material coating have the greatest influence on the efficiency of coatings, and polyurethane is the main material for coating, but because of the complicated and twisted space structure of the inner passage of centrifugal pump impeller, the high viscosity characteristics of polyurethane and the limitation of traditional coating technology, it is difficult to achieve high efficiency and high quality coating on the surface of complex impeller inner runners with coupling bionic functional surface layer materials. and it is difficult to control the thickness of the coating. In order to solve the above problems, a self-made rotating coating equipment by means of centrifugal force was introduced in this paper, using which, the coating thickness could be controlled by pouring temperature, rotating speed, coating time and other parameters. According to the combination design principle of Box-Behnken Design in Design-Expert software, taking the coating thickness of impeller runner as test index, a 3 factors and 3 levels orthogonal combination experiment was designed, the above parameters were optimized and the quadratic fitting equation was established. The test results showed that the main and secondary factors affecting the coating thickness were rotating speed of equipment, pouring temperature and coating duration. The comparative coating tests were carried out on the impeller of 200QJ50-26 centrifugal pump, the results showed that the errors between tested coating thickness controlled by coating parameters and calculated value of quadratic fitting equation was less than 5%, the results were credible. According to the previous research results, when the coating thickness is 0.5 mm, the drag reduction and efficiency increasing of 200QJ50-26 centrifugal pump is the best. The test results showed that the optimum coating parameters for 200 QJ50-26 centrifugal pump to obtain the optimum coating thickness of 0.5 mm were as follows: coating duration was 53.7 s, rotating speed was 401 rad/min, pouring temperature was 90.1℃. The research can provide a reference for the engineering construction of the coupling functional surface on the centrifugal pump.",Tian L.; Zhang J.; Liang Y.; Yao G.; Shang Y.,Journal,Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering,2019-03-15,"Jilin University;Changchun Ruitai Bionic Technology Co., Ltd",Bionics ;  Drag reduction ;  Elastic coating ;  Fitting equation ;  Pumps
Exploration and establishment of magnetic surgery,"In the 21st century, the application of magnetic devices in surgery has been increasingly reported. Among these innovative magnetic devices, many have shown great superiority and subversiveness. Now there is a trend that these innovative techniques may replace traditional techniques. Some advanced magnetic surgical techniques can vastly simplify existing surgical procedures, lower operation difficulty, shorten operation time and improve treatment effect. Others may even challenge the current treatment mode of some diseases. And the concept of magnetic surgery has been changed rapidly. Nevertheless, many common vital bottleneck problems remain unsolved in this new area. The fundamental research on the biologic effects of magnets is far from sufficient. The core problems of magnetic techniques still hang in doubt. The cooperation and integration among institutes of medicine, science and engineering are lacking. The research results remain in certain areas and are more theoretical with little practicability. The last but not the least, the scientific conception and clinical application standards of this novel technique are still vacant. Recently, Chinese researchers have made systemic researches in magnetic surgery and invented a series of international leading techniques. They have achieved remarkable achievements in theoretical innovation and discipline construction, which have occupied the leading place in the world. This article was aimed at discussing the establishment and development of the international discipline of magnetic surgery. In the meantime, this article summarized the developing situation and foundation of magnetic surgery while created expectations. In this article, the authors firstly divided developmental stages of magnetic surgery in a scientific manner. The authors proposed five major systems of magnetic surgery and suggested establishing the discipline of magnetic surgery with interdisciplinary integration. The authors made all efforts to lay a solid foundation of basic researches, set up a theoretical system, standardize clinical researches, and strengthened interdisciplinary integration of magnetic materials, biomechanics and clinical diagnosis and treatment. The authors devoted themselves to unit experts on rare earth metals, biomechanics and clinical medicine. With the integration of multi-institutes, the discipline of magnetic surgery will be soon established normatively. Novel techniques of magnetic surgery will be carried out in clinical application researches. In the near future, the fast development of magnetic surgery will be achieved and benefit human health.",Yan X.; Shang P.; Shi A.; Liu W.; Liu Y.; Lü Y.,Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2019-03-15,The First Hospital of Xian Jiaotong University;State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering;Northwestern Polytechnical University;National Local Joint Engineering Research Center for Precision Surgery & Regenerative Medicine;Regenerative Medicine and Surgery Engineering Research Center of Shaanxi Province,Magnetic anastomosis technique ;  Magnetic anchoring technique ;  Magnetic navigation technique ;  Magnetic surgery ;  Neodymium iron boron

Systems engineering and human factors support of a system of novel EHR-integrated tools to prevent harm in the hospital,"We established a Patient Safety Learning Laboratory comprising 2 core and 3 individual project teams to introduce a suite of digital health tools integrated with our electronic health record to identify, assess, and mitigate threats to patient safety in real time. One of the core teams employed systems engineering (SE) and human factors (HF) methods to analyze problems, design and develop improvements to intervention components, support implementation, and evaluate the system of systems as an integrated whole. Of the 29 participants, 19 and 16 participated in surveys and focus groups, respectively, about their perception of SE and HF. We identified 7 themes regarding use of the 12 SE and HF methods over the 4-year project. Qualitative methods (interviews, focus, groups, observations, usability testing) were most frequently used, typically by individual project teams, and generated the most insight. Quantitative methods (failure mode and effects analysis, simulation modeling) typically were used by the SE and HF core team but generated variable insight. A decentralized project structure led to challenges using these SE and HF methods at the project and systems level. We offer recommendations and insights for using SE and HF to support digital health patient safety initiatives.",Dalal A.; Fuller T.; Garabedian P.; Ergai A.; Balint C.; Bates D.; Benneyan J.,Journal,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association,2019-03-11,College of Engineering;Partners HealthCare;Brigham and Women's Hospital,Health information technology ;  Innovation science ;  Patient safety ;  Quality improvement
Review on designs and properties of multifunctional alkali-activated materials (AAMs),"The stream of research on alkali-activated materials (AAMs) has expanded rapidly during the last decades owing to the potential as a viable alternative to cement-based materials. In addition to the load-carrying function, AAMs have been integrated with other functions to develop advanced construction materials, namely multifunctional AAMs. Multifunctional AAMs are intelligent systems not only serve a basic structural function but also exhibit other functional properties or have the abilities to react upon external stimuli or disturbances. Materials of this kind have tremendous potential to enhance the mechanical performance and durability of structure, improve the reliability and longevity of infrastructure, as well as reduce life-cycle service and maintenance cost. These multifunctional properties are mainly achieved through materials composition design, incorporation of functional elements, or microstructure modification. This paper presents an overview on designs and properties of multifunctional AAMs covering the smart functions, mechanical functions, and electrical functions, and with special attention to their definition, principles, and current progress. Furthermore, the challenges in the research of multifunctional AAMs have been discussed, as well as the future directions to increase the innovation and engineering application of these materials and structures.",Tang Z.; Li W.; Hu Y.; Zhou J.; Tam V.,Journal,Construction and Building Materials,2019-03-10,University of Technology Sydney;Western Sydney University;China University of Geosciences,Alkali-activated materials (AAMs) ;  Design ;  Mechanical properties ;  Multifunctional properties ;  Smart functions

Realizing the Value of Industry-University Innovation Alliances,"Overview: In response to increasing market pressures over the past decade, corporate expectations for measurable results from engagement with universities have climbed. The trend has developed away from one-off cooperation with individual researchers and toward sustained cross-institutional collaborations that produce research that is integrated into the full span of the corporate innovation process. This trend is most visible in the emergence of corporate innovation centers adjacent to major universities, such as Kendall Square in Cambridge and Tech Square in Atlanta. This shift has called for a rethinking of the balance between academic and corporate roles and practices in these relationships. We describe five key practices universities and corporate partners can implement to support successful, sustained industry-university innovation alliances, developed from Georgia Tech’s experience in engaging with 25 corporate partners.",McConnell D.; Cross S.,Journal,Research Technology Management,2019-03-04,University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,Industry-university alliances ;  Open innovation ;  Partnerships
Transforming learning through relevant STEM education for Nigerian students: (Work in Progress by the Social Innovation Enterprise; Carisma4U Educational Foundation),"It's no surprise to state that little has changed in how STEM is taught in Nigeria in the last three decades. As a result, it seems, Nigerian students have been left behind, falling further behind in science and math literacy.There have been futile national reform efforts to improve things. The issue with them has been a lot of inconsistency and lack of a cohesive effort as changes in teaching practices have been minimal.The study used student and teacher data from the programs conducted by the social innovation enterprise. The study presents the data from three programs over two years-Teacher training projects and STEM Bootcamps for children. The findings indicate that the programs do trigger learning and the connection to real world. Also, the study showed that though the exposure to that the teachers and students had to STEM pedagogy was the first time, they appreciated it and found it aided their understanding of the concepts they performed during the programs. This led to further discussion on extensions of the pilot programs and the implications for policy and research.",Salau A.,Conference Proceeding,"2019 9th IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference, ISEC 2019",2019-03-01,"University at Buffalo, The State University of New York",curriculum ;  education ;  Nigeria ;  skills development ;  STEM ;  teaching
Project-based learning in the Chemistry Laboratory: A case of Mexico,"The study of Chemistry is unpopular to students because their lack of connection to their daily life. Project-based learning in a laboratory environment have shown to change the students' perception. In this work in progress, a methodology is presented where the students relate their Chemistry laboratory course with the project of brewing beer. The objective is to observe how the implementation of the project influences the perception of the students taking the course. A pre-experimental research was designed and implemented with a sample of 29 students of the First-Undergraduate Year for different bachelor degrees in Engineering. The students related some concepts shown during the class with some steps of the process of brewing beer. They also got the experience of speaking with experts that work in the field. Three stages of the project are presented and described. The results, measured by the Institutional Opinion Survey of the Student and the comments the students, show that the teaching methodology satisfies the expectations of the students. As a future work, it is proposed to implement a control group in order to compare the experience of the students in the same course. We also propose to include other variables of analysis and to use a broader instrument of measurement in order to perform parametric statistical tests.",Rosas-Melendez S.; Beltran-Sanchez J.,Conference Proceeding,"2019 9th IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference, ISEC 2019",2019-03-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Chemistry laboratory ;  Chemistry teaching ;  Educational innovation ;  Project-based learning
"High School Students' Perceptions about Biology, Related Influence of Factors and Players","Research about students' viewpoints regarding STEM fields mostly address two target groups: physics/mathematics/engineering areas and undergraduate students. The purpose of this paper is to explore 9th-grade students' perceptions about biology and some of the factors and players that influence them in pursuing an academic or professional career in these fields of knowledge. A 13-item survey graded on a 5-point Likert scale was administered to 350 Mexican students from two states, Chiapas and Nuevo Leon, as part of a broad research project that aims to determine which factors and players influence the perceptions of teenagers, from a gender perspective, about STEM fields. Results show statistically significant differences among group participants in the perceptions of the value of biology to their academic futures (T-Test, p=0.035) between genders in the state of Nuevo Leon (T-Test, p=0.037, 0.083). Results also show significant correlation between parents' levels of education and students' self-efficacy (Pearson correlations). Conclusions drawn from this paper discuss the relatedness of teenagers' STEM perceptions and their academic and professional futures with respect to gender, geographic residency, family and self-efficacy.

Virtual Reality and Statistical Thinking Enhancement,"For decades, simulation has been a highly reliable tool for decision making. Even before its fundamental origin, the mathematical branch of system dynamics led to pioneering advances in research, technology and business. Today, virtual reality has become a mainstream technique for employee training. The combination of augmented and virtual reality technologies along with traditional methods of simulation has led to the development of a new powerful instrument of learning applied to complex systems. Our work is the first step of an ambitious project which aims to reinforce the Statistical Thinking of undergraduate students at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education. Using virtual reality and numerical simulation methods our project connects processes and statistics. The student faces the challenge to solve a process problem, which is presented in a first step as a 3D video. By using virtual reality, we expect to develop strong and soft skills in our students enhanced by what we call the five S linked by the five C: Scope-Strategy-Standard-Seamless and Success with Choice-Collaboration-Communication-Critical-Thinking and Creativity. We have measured the impact of using this strategy on student learning. For the last two semesters the outcome has been positive for our learning model, in both quantitative and qualitative variables. We have carried out a parametric hypotheses test, comparing the mean grades obtained in a similar final exam, by students having followed our new method with those having a traditional learning method. Finally, by means of a general survey, we obtained that the student's general opinion, concerning learning statistics by visualizing the 3D real process and challenges, is highly motivating and rewarding.",Rios O.; Lopez L.,Conference Proceeding,"2019 9th IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference, ISEC 2019",2019-03-01,Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México;Tecnológico de Monterrey,Educational Innovation ;  Statistical Thinking ;  STEM ;  Virtual Reality
My Teacher is a Hologram: Measuring innovative STEM learning experiences,"There has been very little research regarding the use of holograms for educational purposes, and it seems there is not enough research on the use of holographic technology and its effects on students' learning outcomes.This study proposes a way to measure how learning outcomes, engagement, flow and social presence are impacted by a hologram teaching experience implemented with first-year engineering students, specifically, in a physics class. The University has been guided lately by a new educational model, the Tec21 model, that has four fundamental pillars: a) inspiring teachers, b) technology to improve learning, c) flexible learning experiences and d) challenge-based learning.Our objective was to evaluate an Engineering School initiative for first year students aimed to address two of the new educational-model pillars; namely inspiring teachers and flexible learning experiences. The research problem lies on the difficulty of measuring whether 'Educational Innovations' really impact learning outcomes and, if they do, to what extent? This was our research question.A quantitative instrument was developed and applied in a pilot phase to six groups of students (N=160). The pilot study showed good instrument reliability. It seems to indicate that an isolated strategy does not impact learning outcomes or student engagement directly, but the combination of many factors does.",Paredes S.; Vazquez N.,Conference Proceeding,"2019 9th IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference, ISEC 2019",2019-03-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Educational Innovation ;  Engineering Education ;  Hologram teacher

Promoting Creativity in Final Year Engineering Students' Project: A case study in the Smart Cities context,"This paper describes a laboratory-like environment, aligned with the Smart City paradigm, aiming to foster creativity in engineering students, in ICT areas. Students should define and elaborate their project, which must be open enough to stimulate students' creativity and, at the same time, framed by a context that makes it an exciting initiative concerning real business. In a typical engineering laboratory, when defining this kind of activity, instructors (scholars or researchers) usually fall in one of two situations: 1) a very rigid project plan supported by a scholarship, oriented by requirements defined within a research project; or 2) a very academic exploratory project without clear short-Term objectives, namely within the time the student will dedicate to it. Trying to avoid both perspectives usually is difficult, but subjects like Smart Cities, with a considerable innovation space, are clearly favorable to that goal. In this paper, starting from some models proposed to foster creativity in students, we will describe the steps taken to prepare a laboratory where students and companies can find an environment to promote creativity and critical thinking.",Santos H.; Martins R.; Brito C.; Ciampi M.,Conference Proceeding,"EDUNINE 2019 - 3rd IEEE World Engineering Education Conference: Modern Educational Paradigms for Computer and Engineering Career, Proceedings",2019-03-01,Universidade do Minho;Science and Education Research Council,

The overriding goal was to improve student learning and success rates in K–12 math and science courses by helping to accelerate the process of bringing effective educational innovation, CEEMS, to scale. In CEEMS, teachers were trained in using challenge-based learning (CBL) and the engineering design process (EDP), teaching pedagogies to transform their classrooms into student-centered, hands-on learning environments, while also assisting students to improve their evaluation scores related to science, math, and engineering instruction. CEEMS teachers acquired the necessary skills through coursework, professional development (PD) workshops, and longitudinal professional guidance provided by assigned coaches over a period of two years to become proficient in developing CBL–EDP curriculum, teaching it, and assessing student learning and reflecting after teaching. The authors have documented how they used customer market research conducted during the I-Corps L training to define their minimum viable product (MVP) to duplicate the successful CEEMS methodology through a condensed (≤16 week) self-paced, completely online training program with virtual coaching support. The authors also describe the process they used to move forward very quickly from an MVP to a more complete product offering, its branding, the process of trademarking it, and finally licensing it to an established non-profit organization (NPO) for future marketing. Details of the whole experience are presented with the hope that it will serve as a useful guide for other venture creators.",Kukreti A.; Broering J.,Journal,Education Sciences,2019-03-01,College of Engineering and Applied Science;University of Cincinnati,Challenge-based learning ;  Coaching ;  Engineering design process ;  Online professional development training ;  Student engagement
Spatial interaction network structure and its influence on new energy enterprise technological innovation capability: Evidence from China,"Improving the new energy enterprise technological innovation capability can effectively protect the ecology of the environment and reduce the consumption of resources. Based on the gravity model and the quadratic assignment procedure analysis method, this paper builds the spatial interaction network of new energy enterprise technology innovation capability. In this paper, we analyse the structural characteristics of the spatial interaction network and explore the main factors that influence it. The results show that the spatial interaction network of new energy enterprise technological innovation capability is robust. The network relations are closely linked, and there is no strict grade in this spatial interaction network. There are both centralization and marginalization trends in this network, and the block division is obvious. In addition, if there is proper reception, transmission capability, economic distance, and geographical distance are the main factors that can impact the interaction strength of this network. According to empirical research results, the relevant policy recommendations for promoting the new energy enterprise technology innovation capability are proposed. The policy recommendations include establishing the new energy technology innovation exchange platform, formulating regional development policies for the new energy enterprise, and improving the regional investment financing mechanism of the new energy enterprise.",Su Y.; Yu Y.,Journal,Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy,2019-03-01,University of Bradford School of Management;Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management;Harbin Engineering University,
Organoids as a new model for improving regenerative medicine and cancer personalized therapy in renal diseases,"The pressure towards innovation and creation of new model systems in regenerative medicine and cancer research has fostered the development of novel potential therapeutic applications. Kidney injuries provoke a high request of organ transplants making it the most demanding system in the field of regenerative medicine. Furthermore, renal cancer frequently threaten patients’ life and aggressive forms still remain difficult to treat. Ethical issues related to the use of embryonic stem cells, has fueled research on adult, patient-specific pluripotent stem cells as a model for discovery and therapeutic development, but to date, normal and cancerous renal experimental models are lacking. Several research groups are focusing on the development of organoid cultures. Since organoids mimic the original tissue architecture in vitro, they represent an excellent model for tissue engineering studies and cancer therapy testing. We established normal and tumor renal cell carcinoma organoids previously maintained in a heterogeneous multi-clone stem cell-like enriching medium. Starting from adult normal kidney specimens, we were able to isolate and propagate organoid 3D-structures composed of both differentiated and undifferentiated cells while expressing nephron specific markers. Furthermore, we were capable to establish organoids derived from cancer tissues although with a success rate inferior to that of their normal counterpart. Cancer cultures displayed epithelial and mesenchymal phenotype while retaining tumor specific markers. Of note, tumor organoids recapitulated neoplastic masses when orthotopically injected into immunocompromised mice. Our data suggest an innovative approach of long-term establishment of normal- and cancer-derived renal organoids obtained from cultures of fleshly dissociated adult tissues. Our results pave the way to organ replacement pioneering strategies as well as to new models for studying drug-induced nephrotoxicity and renal diseases. Along similar lines, deriving organoids from renal cancer patients opens unprecedented opportunities for generation of preclinical models aimed at improving therapeutic treatments.",Grassi L.; Alfonsi R.; Francescangeli F.; Signore M.; De Angelis M.; Addario A.; Costantini M.; Flex E.; Ciolfi A.; Pizzi S.; Bruselles A.; Pallocca M.; Simone G.; Haoui M.; Falchi M.; Milella M.; Sentinelli S.; Di Matteo P.; Stellacci E.; Gallucci M.; Muto G.; Tartaglia M.; De Maria R.; Bonci D.,Journal,Cell Death and Disease,2019-03-01,"Humanitas University;Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS;Sapienza Università di Roma;Università degli Studi di Verona;Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Campus di Roma;Università degli studi di Bari Aldo Moro;IRCCS Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesù;IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute;Istituto Superiore Di Sanita;Università di Verona Scuola di Medicina e Chirurgia",

Calibration and Bias-Correction of the Steel Offshore Jacket Platform Models Using Experimental Data,"Offshore jacket platforms are of great importance due to their roles in shallow water areas, such as the Persian Gulf. Building infrastructures are always a challenge for engineers because of uncertainties in different aspects. Using an experimental model is an essential technique for reducing uncertainties. However, using experimental data adds other uncertainties to the problems and dealing with them can play a key role in project applicability and success. Uncertainties in every engineering problem can be classified into three distinct groups related to the computer model: (1) numerical uncertainty, (2) parameter uncertainty, and (3) structural uncertainty. Among these categorized uncertainties, the second and the third ones are considered for the case study of this research. In this study, model parameter uncertainties and the structural uncertainties have been considered simultaneously. This approach is applied to a three-dimensional (3D) fixed offshore jacket model (SPD9 located in the Persian Gulf) for the first time in the offshore structure field, both numerically and experimentally. Disagreements between the numerical model predictions and experiments are reduced by considering the calibration of model uncertain parameters and a discrepancy term, which is defined by a mathematical function for a real project. Therefore, the main benefits and innovations of the methodology can be stated as (1) using experimental data through modal analysis of a 3D steel offshore jacket platform for numerical model updating and (2) developing a previously studied method through reducing parametric and structural uncertainties simultaneously. The results express the success of considering parameter uncertainty and structural uncertainty for the previously mentioned case study by decreasing the disagreements between experimental data and numerical simulation. The results also indicate the importance of considering a discrepancy term in the calculation phase as a model form error term due to increasing the applicability of the proposed method for an offshore jacket platform.",Hokmabady H.; Mojtahedi A.; Ali Lotfollahi-Yaghin M.; Farajpour I.,Journal,"Journal of Waterway, Port, Coastal and Ocean Engineering",2019-03-01,South Carolina State University;University of Tabriz,Discrepancy function ;  Finite-element model updating ;  Model form error ;  Offshore jacket platform ;  Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm ;  Uncertainty analysis

University–Industry Linkages in Promoting Technology Transfer: A Study of Vietnamese Technical and Engineering Universities,"Both university and industry are key actors of the national innovation system (NIS) of any country (OECD (1997) National Innovation Systems, OECD Publishing, Paris). Not only does the university or industry contribute to the knowledge production and transformation in the NIS as an individual actor but also the collaboration between these two institutions is increasingly a critical component of the NIS. This is truly illustrated either in developed countries or in developing ones. This article first reviews the current status of NIS in Vietnam to see the contribution of Vietnamese universities in knowledge transfer. Second, it describes the collaboration between university and industry in Vietnam by presenting the findings of a survey of 570 respondents, who are teaching at five Vietnamese technical and engineering universities to better understand the different types of university-industry (U–I) collaboration and motivations of and barriers to the university and industry linkage in Vietnam. Based on such findings, some recommendations to promote the university and industry linkage in research and technology transfer are proposed for the university, the industry and the government so that the Vietnam’s NIS will have more impact on economic development.",Hoc L.; Trong N.,Journal,"Science, Technology and Society",2019-03-01,,National innovation system ;  technological research and transfer ;  university ;  U–I linkage ;  Vietnam
Clinical Immersion: An Approach for Fostering Cross-disciplinary Communication and Innovation in Nursing and Engineering Students,"Background A faculty team from nursing and chemical engineering developed a course that brought together students from each discipline for cross-disciplinary, team-based clinical immersion and collaboration. Problem Health care processes and devices are rapidly changing, and nurses are uniquely positioned to be bedside innovators to improve patient care delivery. Approach During each clinical immersion, the student teams rotated through various hospital units where they identified problems and worked together in the university's makerspace (iMaker Space) to design and build prototypes to improve health outcomes. Outcomes Data from the Critical thinking Assessment Test provided evidence of gains in critical-thinking and problem-solving skills, while the problems identified in the clinical setting and prototypes developed demonstrated the impact of bringing nursing and engineering students together to design innovations. Conclusions When challenged to identify authentic problems during their clinical immersion, the teams of nursing and engineering students proposed creative solutions and developed commercially viable prototypes.",Geist M.; Sanders R.; Harris K.; Arce-Trigatti A.; Hitchcock-Cass C.,Journal,Nurse Educator,2019-03-01,"Tennessee Technological University;The University of Tennessee, Knoxville",chemical engineering ;  clinical immersion ;  cross-disciplinary teamwork ;  makerspace ;  nursing students
Comparing the Effects of Design Interventions on the Quality of Design Concepts as a Reflection of Ideation Flexibility,"Many tools, techniques, and other interventions have been developed to support idea generation within the design process. In previous research, we explored the separate effects of three such design interventions: teaming, problem framing, and design heuristics. In the teaming intervention, participants discussed a design prompt together but recorded their own ideas separately. In problem framing, multiple versions (framings) of each design prompt were used to elicit different solutions. In design heuristics, participants used specially designed cards to prompt new ways of thinking about the given design problem. In the current work, we compared the effects of these three interventions on students' design ideas with respect to one idea attribute in particular-quality. In total, 1088 design concepts were collected from 171 undergraduate students in engineering and industrial design from two universities. Individual cognitive style was also assessed using Kirton's Adaption-Innovation inventory (KAI). Six metrics taken from the design literature were used to assess the quality of each concept, namely: acceptability, applicability, clarity, effectiveness, implementability, and implicational explicitness. Paired t-tests and Pearson correlations were used to assess differences in quality between concepts generated with and without the three interventions; in addition, secondary effects were sought based on the cognitive styles and academic standings of the participants. Statistically significant differences were observed in design concept quality for the teaming and design heuristics interventions over the full sample and for some subgroups separated by cognitive style and academic standing. These results have implications for how educators teach design interventions and how students choose and apply interventions to affect the quality of their own design solutions.",Henderson D.; Jablokow K.; Daly S.; McKilligan S.; Silk E.; Bracken J.,Journal,Journal of Mechanical Design,2019-03-01,"Penn State College of Engineering;Rutgers University Graduate School of Education;Penn State Great Valley;University of Michigan, Ann Arbor;Iowa State University",design concepts ;  design interventions ;  Idea generation ;  quality metrics
Striving for benefits of sustainability from the interactivity of quality and innovation,"In this article, sustainability is considered as a subset of quality and as a challenging target area to innovations for the quality of society. Quality and innovation are conceptually age-old issues and significant business factors today. They represent two distinct professional disciplines, which have a lot of meaningful connections. However, their formal definitions have not been commonly established and neither have their relationships been clearly recognized. Hence in this article, their practical definitions and interactivity are discussed and highlighted regarding individuals, organizations and society. Also, the relatively new concept of sustainability is not understood unambiguously nor practiced consistently. The purpose of the article is to clarify the concepts and to present a comprehensive approach to the theory of sustainability through interactive quality and innovation management for enhancing the quality of society. Organizations play an important role in striving for sustainable development. Quality and innovation management should be considered in an integrated way in the organizations, and they should cover the area of sustainability. In the whole society, sustainability is realized through diffusion. National and regional initiatives have been launched to promote quality, innovation and sustainability measures. Ultimately, quality and innovation are based on human creativity, activity, and perception. In this article, discipline-dedicated research and development of quality and innovation, interdisciplinary collaboration and multidisciplinary integrative realization of the specific organizational solutions are highlighted and conceptualized. The ideas presented are based on the long-term practical experience of the authors and our studies from different perspectives and critical inference. When considering practical events, objects and problems, we have combined sound and justified conceptual thinking in creating objective knowledge as the foundation for the efficient doing and effective methodological means.",Anttila J.; Jussila K.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2019-03-01,Helsingin Yliopisto;International Academy for Quality (IAQ),Human individual ;  Innovation ;  Integration ;  Management ;  Organization ;  Quality ;  Society ;  Sustainability
Creating the golden triangle of evidence-informed education technology with EDUCATE,"EDUCATE is a London-based programme that supports the development of research-informed educational technology (EdTech), allowing entrepreneurs and start-ups to create their products and services, and simultaneously grow their companies in a more evidence-informed manner. The programme partners businesses with researchers who mentor, guide and support this research journey, a key aspect of which is the evaluation of the company’s EdTech product or service. However, conducting impact evaluations of technology in education is challenging, particularly for early stage technologies, as rapid cycles of innovation and change are part of their essence. Here, we present the pragmatic approach to evidence-informed education technology design and impact evaluation, as developed and adopted by the EDUCATE programme. The research process is shaped by the core principles of evidence-informed decision making detailed in the paper. The contributions of the paper are threefold. First, it defines and details an academia-industry-education collaboration model centred on a research training programme. Second, it presents emerging impact results of the programme. Third, it provides clear reflections on the challenges encountered during the implementation of the model in the EdTech ecosystem of London, which should be addressed if we are to move towards evidence-informed EdTech globally.",Cukurova M.; Luckin R.; Clark-Wilson A.,Journal,British Journal of Educational Technology,2019-03-01,UCL Knowledge Lab;University College London,
"Eco-innovation in process engineering: Contradictions, inventive principles and methods","Economic growth and ecological problems motivate industries to apply eco-friendly technologies and equipment. However, environmental impact, followed by energy and material consumption still remain the main negative implications of the technological progress in process engineering. Based on extensive patent analysis, this paper assigns more than 250 identified eco-innovation problems and requirements to 14 general eco-categories with energy consumption and losses, air pollution, and acidification as top issues. It defines primary eco-engineering contradictions, in case eco-problems appear as negative side effects of the new technologies, and secondary eco-engineering contradictions, if eco-friendly solutions have new environmental drawbacks. The study conceptualizes a correlation matrix between the eco-requirements for prediction of typical eco-contradictions on example of processes involving solids handling. Finally, it summarizes major eco-innovation approaches including Process Intensification in process engineering, and chronologically reviews 66 papers on eco-innovation adapting TRIZ methodology. Based on analysis of 100 eco-patents, 58 process intensification technologies, and literature, the study identifies 20 universal TRIZ inventive principles and sub-principles that have a higher value for environmental innovation.

Technological and legislative status point of stationary energy storages in the EU,"European renewable generation has been supported through several policy instruments in the last decades, and this has caused a significant growth of the renewable energy sector, spurred by the ambitious climate and energy policy targets. Despite this impetuous growth, the electricity infrastructure is not yet ready to accept increasing shares of variable renewable energy sources (RES) generation, and this is causing grid balance challenges, due to the inherently variable nature of the PV and wind energy. In order to overcome this issue, allowing higher shares of renewable generation in the energy sector, energy storage (ES) systems are becoming increasingly competitive in the global energy landscape, thanks to the positive momentum in research and innovation, making European energy supply more secure, sustainable and affordable. Despite the unarguable benefits, storage technologies still see significant needs for more education among stakeholders, since they are not familiar with technology's benefits and management solutions. In order to fill this gap, this study provides an overview of storage technologies for stationary applications in the EU (plus Bosnia-Erzegovina, Norway and Switzerland), addressing the main trends in European policy legislation, also identifying advantages and barriers for their implementation. Furthermore, based on the analysis of the US Department of Energy (DOE) storage database, the main trends in ES installations within the EU markets are identified, with reference to storage technologies. The analysis carried out in this work could help stakeholders to assess the European storage market evolution in the stationary sector, identifying the main drivers and barriers for each storage technology.",Dusonchet L.; Favuzza S.; Massaro F.; Telaretti E.; Zizzo G.,Journal,Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,2019-03-01,Università degli Studi di Palermo,Database ;  Energy storage systems ;  EU ;  Regulatory framework ;  Stationary applications ;  Storage technologies
Using survival analysis to discovering pathways to success in mathematics,"Mathematics is viewed as essential to the economic competitiveness of the United States on the global stage (US Department of Education). As a part of the core Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields, mathematics is vital to the nation's economic prosperity, yet enrollment in STEM fields at the college/university level has remained relatively stable, despite millions of dollars expended to improve STEM education and retention. Most extant research focuses on innovations within classroom settings that can improve learning outcomes for students pursuing STEM majors. Additional research is needed in examining how the sequencing of courses taken by students can help or hinder their progress toward the successful completion of a STEM degree. In this first phase of our research, quantitative analytics was used to identify the impact of specific courses on students’ risk of dropping out of a Math major. Findings suggest a general inverse correlation between academic performance and attrition: good performance predicts lower attrition rates. Survival analysis indicated that the further a student goes within the math major, the greater the risk of dropping out. Students in a Math major tend to be more likely to drop out after their 4th year compared to their first three years. In general, students show increased inclination to switch majors from their second year and those students who have stayed in the program for too long are very likely to switch to another major.",Zhuhadar L.; Daday J.; Marklin S.; Kessler B.; Helbig T.,Journal,Computers in Human Behavior,2019-03-01,Florida State University,Data mining ;  Learning analytics ;  Predictive model ;  Survival analysis
Industrial innovation and productive structures: The creation of America's ‘Arsenal of democracy’,"This paper uses World War II as a real world laboratory to examine the historical-structural origins of America's unique systemic capability to create new and transform existing industrial sectors. Between 1935-9 and 1944, US munitions production increased 140 times versus 7 times in Germany while national output nearly doubled. American wartime industrial policy did not correct for market failure; it designed and fostered permanent organizational changes in the productive structures of the economy that transformed the national system of industrial innovation. The War Production Board (WPB) was at the center of both macroeconomic and production policymaking. Its focus was on the measurement, coordination and transformation of production. The Office of Scientific Research and Development was at the center of the creation of an inter-organizational science and technology R&D system. Simon Kuznets, economist at the WPB, was the author of the Victory Program by which economic and military strategies were coordinated. Vannevar Bush was the organizational architect of America's ‘triple helix’ system to create and rapidly grow advanced technology weapon systems. With hindsight, Kuznets and Bush, and the agencies they represented, combined to inter-connect the productive structures to enact a strategy to integrate mass production with technological innovation. Kuznets was awarded the third Nobel Prize in economics; Bush's Science-The Endless Frontier, was the clarion call for what became America's postwar science and technology infrastructure. However, like the postwar economics literature, both Kuznets and Bush failed to conceptualize their inter-relationships.",Best M.,Journal,Structural Change and Economic Dynamics,2019-03-01,,Bottleneck analysis ;  Bottleneck policy analysis ;  Economic governance ;  Macroeconomic planning ;  Principle of flow ;  Production engineering ;  Production systems ;  Production transformation ;  Triple helix
Review of the possibility of knowledge in educational sciences,"There are many trends that determine all the possibilities that exist in the education sciences. These are oriented to the formation of the human being. The current development is demarcated by the use of active methodologies through science, research, technology and innovation. where the Universities advance in the professional formation of the students through the virtualization of the education. In the present work we intend to review the current state of the research work at national and international level in relation to the different ways of covering the teaching - learning processes. For that, an exhaustive review of the bibliographical sources was made through the use of several specialized databases such as Ebsco, ISI Web of science, Latindex Open Access, Scielo and Scopus. The articles classified as most relevant by these databases were selected taking into account their citation index. As a result you can see a variety of possibilities that still use the traditional forms of education and citizenship training based on traditional master classes where the teacher is the protagonist of academic activity and you can also see new methodologies that apply the new possibilities of education based on virtualization and independent training based on a more globalized and participatory education where the student is the protagonist of their learning.",Vera-Rivera J.,Conference Proceeding,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,2019-02-26,"Universidad del Valle, Cali",
Strengthening relational ties and building loyalty through relational innovation and technology: Evidence from Spanish hotel guests,"Smart tourism relies on the ability to collect enormous amounts of data and intelligently store, process, combine, analyse and use big data to inform business innovation, operations and services. Companies are becoming aware of the potential of analytics and big data and the need to invest in technology to remain competitive. Most of the research on big data, technology and innovation in tourism focuses on the firm's perspective, paying scanty attention to customers' perceptions. The present chapter aims to analyse the impact of hotel relational innovation and technology on brand equity and hotel-guest relational ties and customer loyalty. This objective has been pursued in quantitative research through personal interviews with Spanish guests of 3, 4 and 5-star hotels in the Valencia region, one of the top holiday destinations in Spain. The sample of 401 guests at 42 hotels provides evidence to suggest a significant positive impact of relational innovation on guest perceptions of hotel technology and strength of relational ties. Moreover, information and communication technologies exert a positive impact on overall brand equity which, in turn, has a positive impact on relational ties and guest loyalty. Relational innovation makes a particularly strong contribution to the strength of relational ties and ultimately, loyalty. Empirical research is urgently needed in this area to gain insight into these relations and the role of big data in value creation.",Gil-Saura I.; Ruiz-Molina M.; Servera-Francés D.,Book,"Big Data and Innovation in Tourism, Travel, and Hospitality: Managerial Approaches, Techniques, and Applications",2019-02-26,Universidad Católica de Valencia San Vicente Mártir;Universitat de València,Big data ;  Brand equity ;  Hotels ;  Information and communication technology ;  Loyalty ;  Relational innovation ;  Strength of relational ties
On Collaborative Innovation Mechanism of National Defense Science and Technology Industry in China,"It is a long time that China's national defense science and technology innovation have not formed an integrated system of civil military integration and operation mechanism. This pattern of separation between the military industry and the civilian industry has been increasingly unable to meet the needs of the national security and development in the new era. The collaborative innovation of the national defense science and technology requires the integration of the national defense technology innovation and the civil innovation mechanism, and the integration of the two parties to maximize the input and output efficiency of the national scientific and technological innovation. Now there are some problems in the cooperative innovation mechanism of China's defense science and technology industry, such as the main body of technology innovation is not coordinated, the information of national defense demand is not coordinated, the level of independent innovation is not coordinated, and the general standards of military and civilian are not coordinated, but the success or failure of building a national defense science and technology collaborative innovation system lies in the system and mechanism. In the future, China should improve the cooperative innovation mechanism of its defense science and technology industry in the aspects of straightening the relationship between different subjects, establishing a unified leadership management system and a coordinated operation mechanism between the army and the local authorities, building a platform carrier across the army and the local units and formulating general standards for the military and the local units.",Gu W.; Wang X.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,2019-02-26,Army Logistics Academy;Wuhan Institute of Technology,

"Using AHP, DEA and MPI for governmental research institution performance evaluation","Under situations of limited resources, soft powers such as technology development and innovation become critical capabilities for a nation’s continuous growth and sustainability. Therefore, we used analytical hierarchy process (AHP), data envelopment analysis (DEA), and Malmquist productivity index (MPI) to evaluate the performance of research projects in 6 main fields of study managed by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) in Taiwan from 2002 to 2012. Among the 6 fields of study, Agriculture and Humanities were two research fields as efficiency; and the sequence of inefficiency 4 fields were sociology, medicine, science, and engineering. Although the field of sociology was inefficiency, it was the only field show continuous growth in result of MPI analysis. Taking the fields as a whole, the result of the analysis of total factor productivity showed recession. However, as seen from the growth in technical change and in scale efficiency change, the MOST was effective to a certain extent during the period. However, the recession in technical efficiency change showed that further improvement in the planning and distribution of manpower and funds is needed.",Liu C.; Wang T.; Yu G.,Journal,Applied Economics,2019-02-25,Anshan Normal University;National Sun Yat-Sen University;Chang Jung Christian University,analytical hierarchy process (AHP) ;  data envelopment analysis (DEA) ;  Malmquist productivity index (MPI) ;  Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST)
Road Restraint Systems as a Basis for Roadside Safety Improvement,"Roadside-related crashes occur when vehicles run off the road. The majority of the crashes have severe outcomes, especially when an object is hit (tree, pole, supports, front wall of a culvert, barrier). These accidents represent app. 19% of all of Poland's road deaths. Roadside crashes involve: hitting a tree, hitting a barrier, hitting a sign or utility pole, vehicle roll-over on the roadside, vehicle roll-over on a slope and vehicle roll-over into a ditch. Understanding the effects of roadside factors on road safety requires in-depth research. The problem was partly addressed at the WMCAUS conference in 2017 [1]. Key to understanding the needs and tools of road infrastructure management for preventing run-off-road crashes or minimising their consequences is to identify the hazards and sources of hazards caused by wrong or improper use of road safety devices. It is also important to identify errors in the design, structure, construction and operation of road safety devices. Studying such an extended scope of the problem required fieldwork. Site tests had to be conducted such as hitting a wire rope barrier and a steel barrier on curve (test TB32), light and heavy vehicles hitting a bridge parapet (tests TB11 and TB51), hitting a transition between a steel and wire rope barrier (TB32) and crashes into a lighting column placed within the barrier's working width. In addition, the project includes numerical tests validated on the basis of site tests. This helps to assess the behaviour of road restraint systems when selected parameters are changed. The work is part of the RID Programme (Development of Road Innovation) and the RoSE project (Road Safety Equipment). In the article the authors present the effects of building a road restraint system database for a selected test site (about 3,000 km of Poland's national roads). An outline of new road restraint system guidelines could only be developed after understanding the effects of restraint systems, the design, additional elements, type of road and safety barrier location on a road or engineering structure and the road and traffic conditions on their functionality and safety. The paper will present the preliminary results of this research. Once complete, the research will offer tools to help with the implementation of road restraint systems. The tools will ensure that road infrastructure is safer and that the most common mistakes are eliminated.",Budzyński M.; Gobis A.; Jamroz K.; Jelinski L.; Ostrowski K.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2019-02-24,Gdańsk University of Technology;Politechnika Krakowska,

"Technological innovation, environmental regulation, and green total factor efficiency of industrial water resources","The aim of this study based on the panel data of 30 Chinese provinces obtained from 2000 to 2016 was to calculate the green total factor efficiency (GTFE) of industrial water resources by applying the Super-Slack Based Measure (SBM) model of non-expected output, and to analyze the effect of core variables (technological innovation, environmental regulation, and the interaction of these two factors) and control variables (education level, industrial development and the degree of openness) on the GTFE of industrial water resources by making use of Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) model and the dynamic panel system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). The results show that technological innovation had no significant impact on the GTFE of industrial water resources in China and the eastern region. It had a restraining impact on the central region, while a positive effect on the western region. Environmental regulation was not conducive to the improvement of China's GTFE of industrial water resources, and the promotion of efficiency in the eastern, central, and western regions was not significant. The interaction between technological innovation and environmental regulation positively affected the GTFE of industrial water resources of China, whereas it had a negative impact on the central region and an insignificant impact on the eastern and central regions. This showed that there were regional, economic, and industrial structure differences in the effect of technological innovation and environmental regulation on the GTFE of industrial water resources. In addition, the first-phase lag of GTFE of industrial water resources in China and the central region, the degree of openness of China and eastern, central, and western regions, the education level of central residents, and the industrial development degree of western region effectively improved the GTFE of industrial water resources, whereas the education level of western residents had an inhibitory impact. Therefore, China needs to formulate a differentiated and diversified technological innovation system and environmental protection policy, improve the green research and development investment of industrial enterprises, and form a green development model; at the same time, China needs to guide rational consumption, develop high-tech industries, and adhere to opening up.",Jin W.; Zhang H.; Liu S.; Zhang H.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2019-02-20,Huaiyin Teachers University;Hohai University,Efficiency of industrial water resources ;  Environmental regulation ;  Green total factor ;  Technological innovation
Dielectric Elastomer Artificial Muscle: Materials Innovations and Device Explorations,"CONSPECTUS: Creating an artificial muscle has been one of the grand challenges of science and engineering. The invention of such a flexible, versatile, and power efficient actuator opens the gate for a new generation of lightweight, highly efficient, and multifunctional robotics. Many current artificial muscle technologies enable low-power mobile actuators, robots that mimic efficient and natural forms of motion, autonomous robots and sensors, and lightweight wearable technologies. They also have serious applications in biomedical devices, where biocompatibility, from a chemical, flexibility, and force perspective, is crucial. It remains unknown which material will ultimately form the ideal artificial muscle. Anything from shape memory alloys (SMAs) to pneumatics to electroactive polymers (EAPs) realize core aspects of the artificial muscle goal. Among them, EAPs most resemble their biological counterparts, and they encompass both ion-infusion and electric field based actuation mechanisms. Some of the most investigated EAPs are dielectric elastomers (DEs), whose large strains, fracture toughness, and power-to-weight ratios compare favorably with natural muscle. Although dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) only entered the artificial muscle conversation in the last 20 years, significant technological progress has reflected their high potential. Research has focused on solving the core issues surrounding DEAs, which includes improving their operational ranges with regard to temperature and voltage, adding new functionality to the materials, and improving the reliability of the components on which they depend. Mechanisms designed to utilize their large-strain actuation and low stiffness has also attracted attention. This Account covers important research by our group and others in various avenues such as decreasing viscoelastic losses in typical DE materials, increasing their dielectric constant, and countering electromechanical instability. We also discuss variable stiffness polymers, specifically bistable electroactive polymers, which, notably, open DEAs to structural applications typically unattainable for soft-actuator technologies. Furthermore, we explore advancements related to highly compliant and transparent electrodes, a crucial component of DEAs capable of achieving high actuation strain. We then cover noteworthy applications, including several novel devices for soft robotics and microfluidics, and how those applications fit within other major developments in the field. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the remaining challenges facing current DEA technology and speculate on research directions that may further advance DE-based artificial muscles as a whole. This Account serves as a stepping stone into the field of EAPs, which, through the work of researchers worldwide, are positioned as a potential challenger to conventional actuator technologies.",Qiu Y.; Zhang E.; Plamthottam R.; Pei Q.,Journal,Accounts of Chemical Research,2019-02-19,UCLA Samueli School of Engineering,

The challenges of personalized learning and their solutions,"Since ancient times, the dream of realizing inclusive, fair and personalized learning has been chasing in the education filed all over the world. With the rapid development of information technologies, the traditional large-scale education system generated in the industrial revolution era cannot satisfy the increasing demand for personalized education services in the information era. Thus currently the reform and innovation of education is at a critical turning point. To specify, personalized learning is being focused on during the global education innovation and reform, and deep reform within the education field is being promoted by big data technology. Compared with other countries, during the current global education innovation and reform, China is facing more difficult challenges caused by a large number of active learners, complex learning environment, large-scale education resource supply, and a wide variety of learning service. Therefore the problem about how to provide large-scale, high-accuracy and personalized learning in China needs to be solved urgently, which is unique without precedents. The arising of information technologies, such as internet, cloud computing, big data, and artificial intelligent, has brought in not only diversified resources, scale data, and intelligent computing, but also the fusion between education and natural science. Consequently, the scientific paradigm of education has been changed from traditional experience-based research into data driven research. Such change, on the one hand, has offered a new approach to realize accurate and scientific education; on the other hand, has made an initial breakthrough in personalized learning. A historical opportunity to educate a learner according to his/her natural ability has finally arrived. To promote the data-driven application innovation as well as to achieve scale and personalized education, have both become an inexorable trend for the modern education. Due to the continuous influence of information technologies, the boundaries of learning time and space have both been broken completely. In addition, many great changes have taken place in learning environments, methods and contents, which obviously provide learners with more choices about what to learn and how to learn. In the future, the aim of personalized learning is to satisfy the personalized development demand for each learner, however it will definitely face serious challenges, e.g., how to understand learning subjects, how to construct learning environment, and how to implement teaching. In this paper, three basic scientific problems to be solved in personalized learning are discussed, which include (1) educational scenarios is calculable; (2) learning subjects is understandable; (3) learning services is customizable. Furthermore, in order to realize differentiated instruction, personalized learning, refined management, and intelligent services, breakthroughs in both theories and technologies needed are presented in this paper, including human-technology learning environment, learning data sensing and fusion, edge computing for education scenes, learning mechanism in digital environments, student modeling and analysis under data driven, group dynamics of the learner group, education resource supply, accurate education service, intelligent tutoring system. Education is a complex dynamic system, which needs both breakthrough research and systematic research. To effectively promote the research of personalized learning, actions needs to be taken, including for example implementing education research and experiment systematically, speeding up breakthroughs and talent training, solving scientific problems in the education field by means of multidisciplinary approach and wisdom as well as the multi-party cooperation mechanism named ""politics-industry-academic-research-application"". Based on a comprehensive analysis on counter-measures and research trends to personalized learning in western developed countries, in order to cope with challenges of personalized learning and help meet the goals of Education 2030 in China, the following four suggestions are proposed in this paper: (1) promoting the formation of educational science; (2) speeding up the construction of laws and regulations related to large-scale educational data; (3) exploring data-driven instructional evaluation mechanism and methods; and (4) increasing policy support in the research on teaching competency standards and teachers' promotion path in the new era.",Yang Z.,Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2019-02-15,Xidian University;National Engineering Research Center for Big Data Technology and System,Artificial intelligence ;  Big data ;  Personalized learning
Technological innovation as a source of Chinese multinationals’ firm-specific advantages and internationalization,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how innovation-related firm-specific ownership advantage (FSA) plays a role in developing the competitive advantage of Chinese multinationals when they internationalize. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a review of the existing literature concerning foreign direct investment by emerging economy multinational enterprises (EMNEs), the authors identify that numerous studies explain this phenomenon on the basis of their location-bound country-specific advantages. However, such views do not fully explain the key underlying factors behind the rapid rise and success of many EMNEs as these firms rapidly internationalize and develop global competitiveness in developed markets. The current research explores three leading innovative Chinese EMNEs from the engineering sector: BYD, Sany Heavy Industry and CSR China. Findings: The authors find that EMNEs’ knowledge, and particularly their innovation-creating technological knowledge, has contributed greatly to their successful internationalization. The illustrative cases show that the three firms have now moved beyond the infant to the mature stage of EMNE development through developing their technological knowledge in order to realize FSA through internationalization. This study helps in contributing fresh reflections to the continuing debate concerning the causes of internationalization and global competitive development by EMNEs and the role of their FSAs in these processes. Originality/value: This is one of the few studies which have demonstrated that some of the EMNEs do possess firms’ specific advantage which helps explain their innovative capabilities, competitive advantages and subsequent internationalization patterns.",He S.; Khan Z.; Lew Y.; Fallon G.,Journal,International Journal of Emerging Markets,2019-02-15,Brunel Business School;Kent Business School;Hankuk University of Foreign Studies;University of Northampton,China ;  Country-specific advantages ;  Emerging market multinationals ;  Firm-specific advantages ;  Internationalization ;  Outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) ;  Technological innovation
Absorptive capacity and innovation in China,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to question the conventional wisdom that China fails to produce distinctive innovation; its capabilities limited merely to copying and reverse engineering. The author postulates that the lack of innovation is a delayed activity since China is undergoing a process of building absorptive capacity (AC) as a precursor to innovation. Design/methodology/approach: The author probes this question by drawing on the concept of AC, a competence separate from innovativeness and a precursor to it. By drawing on the AC literature three propositions are established. Subsequently, these propositions are examined, in part, with data drawn from 34 interviews conducted in China with CEOs, other senior corporate officers and government officials. In this way, the author explores the challenges to innovating. Findings: Thomson Reuters 2015 Top Global Innovators report listed no Chinese company among its top 100 list of innovative companies. The author’s belief, however, favors China to become a source of innovation. A positive tilt derived from both interviews and recent reports published by Bain & Company, Booz and Co as well as McKinsey & Co. This evidences, the author argues, China is acquiring AC, a competence independent of innovation but a necessary antecedent to decoding and deploying the intellectual property in its portfolio. The collective effect of this is that the perception of China as a source of innovative activity will show an uptick when the AC threshold is reached. Research limitations/implications: This is a viewpoint paper grounded on an exploratory study. Practical implications: Guidance on AC development is valuable to government policy makers promoting innovation in China and those attempting to arbitrage these developments. Similarly, policy makers in competitive nations should also be aware that their innovation-focused industries may need nurturing and bolstering since they may be at risk of being swept away by a tsunami-like innovation wave from China. Originality/value: This is an original take on the relationship of AC and innovativeness in China. The author argues that in contrast to the conventional wisdom China has the potential for innovativeness.",Reid D.,Journal,International Journal of Emerging Markets,2019-02-15,Seattle University,Absorptive capacity ;  Adaptation ;  Appropriability of innovation ;  China ;  Innovation ;  Knowledge spillovers
Software engineering in start-up companies: An analysis of 88 experience reports,"Context: Start-up companies have become an important supplier of innovation and software-intensive products. The flexibility and reactiveness of start-ups enables fast development and launch of innovative products. However, a majority of software start-up companies fail before achieving any success. Among other factors, poor software engineering could be a significant contributor to the challenges experienced by start-ups. However, the state-of-practice of software engineering in start-ups, as well as the utilization of state-of-the-art is largely an unexplored area. Objective: In this study we investigate how software engineering is applied in start-up context with a focus to identify key knowledge areas and opportunities for further research. Method: We perform a multi-vocal exploratory study of 88 start-up experience reports. We develop a custom taxonomy to categorize the reported software engineering practices and their interrelation with business aspects, and apply qualitative data analysis to explore influences and dependencies between the knowledge areas. Results: We identify the most frequently reported software engineering (requirements engineering, software design and quality) and business aspect (vision and strategy development) knowledge areas, and illustrate their relationships. We also present a summary of how relevant software engineering knowledge areas are implemented in start-ups and identify potentially useful practices for adoption in start-ups. Conclusions: The results enable a more focused research on engineering practices in start-ups. We conclude that most engineering challenges in start-ups stem from inadequacies in requirements engineering. Many promising practices to address specific engineering challenges exists, however more research on adaptation of established practices, and validation of new start-up specific practices is needed.",Klotins E.; Unterkalmsteiner M.; Gorschek T.,Journal,Empirical Software Engineering,2019-02-15,Blekinge Tekniska Högskola,Experience reports ;  Software engineering practices ;  Software start-up
Engineering graduate students’ views on the effective ownership of academic patents,"For sustainable and effective innovation, who should own an academic patent obtained as a result of funded research?

Will carbon tax affect the strategy and performance of low-carbon technology sharing between enterprises?,"In practice, carbon tax is an effective supplement to emissions trading system, and is also a key to achieving China's emission reduction targets. Although much research has been done to study the internal mechanism and macro impact of carbon tax, prior literature paid little attention on whether carbon tax affect the strategy and performance of low-carbon technology sharing among enterprise. A differential game model is developed in this paper, which assumed that enterprise low-carbon technology stock is jointly determined by both the efforts of the enterprise low-carbon technology innovation and the external enterprise low-carbon technology sharing. This paper constructs dynamic models under decentralized decision-making with cost-sharing, without cost-sharing, and centralized decision-making respectively, obtain enterprise optimal feedback equilibrium strategies, low-carbon technology stocks and the trajectory of optimal value function of benefits. The results demonstrate that carbon tax can promote enterprise low-carbon technology innovation and sharing to some extent. Meanwhile, this paper found that under the scenario of centralized decision-making, the more the efforts of enterprise low-carbon technology innovation or sharing, the higher the system emission reduction benefits than non-cooperation scenarios. Some factors, such as cost coefficient, cost sharing ratio, etc., will affect the enterprise's decision-making and emission reduction benefits. Finally, the validity of the model is verified through numerical simulation and the sensitivity of the relevant parameters in the scenario of cooperative innovation are analyzed. The results may provide important policy implications for promoting low-carbon technology sharing among enterprises, so as to faciliate the achievement of China's emission reduction targets.",Wang M.; Li Y.; Li M.; Shi W.; Quan S.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2019-02-10,Institutes of Science and Development;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;Beijing Institute of Technology,Carbon tax ;  Differential game model ;  Low-carbon technology innovation ;  Technology sharing strategy

A novel automatic device to measure deformation inside transparent soil based on digital image correlation technology,"In geotechnical engineering, the measurement of soil deformation is one of the most important foundations of soil mechanics research. Transparent soil is a desired choice to obtain information on spatial deformation inside the soil. Based on this, a novel measuring device was developed to automatically record laser speckle images at different laser cross-sections, and the displacement deformation of transparent soil at arbitrary cross-section positions was determined by the planar digital image correlation (DIC) technique. The measuring system was built with two high-precision motorized linear stages. An industrial camera was used in the system to capture the laser speckle images, and synchronization control methods of both the laser transmitter and industrial camera were introduced. The planar DIC technique employed in this paper has been described in detail. The high-precision motorized linear stages proved to have excellent repeatability and the displacement field of a certain laser cross-section in transparent soil can be obtained. Theoretically, the spatial deformation inside the transparent soil can be built based on the displacement fields of multiple laser cross-sections. Finally, the design scheme was confirmed by the model pile experiment. The experiment results show that the automatic measuring system has stable operation, and the deformation of arbitrary laser cross-sections inside transparent soil can be obtained easily. This automatic measurement method can be regarded as an innovation in geotechnical physical model experiments.",Sang Y.; Zhao J.; Duan F.; Sun W.; Zhao H.,Journal,Measurement Science and Technology,2019-02-08,Dalian University of Technology,digital image correlation ;  laser speckle ;  optical measurement ;  repeatability ;  transparent soil
Addressing the imagination gap through STEAMM+D and indigenous knowledge,"Alex Manu describes an “imagination gap,” that is, “the gap between current capability and future possibility” [Manu A (2006) The Imagination Challenge: Strategic Foresight and Innovation in the Global Economy]. Merriam-Webster defines imagination as “the act of forming a mental image of something not present to the senses or never before wholly perceived in reality”; imagination combines “creative ability” and “resourcefulness” [Merriam-Webster (2018) Imagination. Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online. Available at https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/imagination]. This paper considers two interdisciplinary fields in which distinct approaches have sought a solution to the “imagination gap” and have resulted in new research questions, methods, outcomes, and even philosophies. These are science, technology, engineering, arts, math, medicine, and design (STEAMM+D) and Indigenous research that establishes questions and methods from an integrated interdisciplinary worldview and the individual's responsibilities toward community and land. By intertwining these approaches, it is possible for science and society to apply creative problem solving in addressing complex challenges, thereby fostering sustainable innovation.",Diamond S.,Journal,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019-02-05,The Ontario College of Art and Design University,Art ;  Design ;  Indigenous ;  Interdisciplinary ;  New media ;  STEAMM+D

"The relationship of personal innovativeness, quality of digital resources and generic usability with users’ satisfaction: A Pakistani perspective","Purpose: In addition to instrumental assumptions, behavioural researchers suggest the study of individual traits such as personal innovativeness (PI), users’ satisfaction and other theoretical beliefs for example quality and general usage patterns as the latent determinants of early and post-adoptions of technological innovations. In the context of Higher Education Commission digital library of Pakistan, the purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship of PI, quality of digital resources and generic usability of digital libraries (DL) with users’ satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach: To guide the conceptual model of this study, five hypothesized relationships were formulated. Adopting a quantitative approach, snowball sampling techniques were used. A total of 464 users of DL enrolled in different programs of study in the universities of Pakistan participated and responded to the survey. For data analyses, partial least squares, a method in the structural equation modeling was used. Findings: Analyses reveal positive and strong relationships of PI, quality of digital resources and generic usability of DL with users’ satisfaction. Thus, the findings of this study established personal traits as the significant determinants of intention to adopt DL. Research limitations/implications: The decision of effective adoption is manipulated by the extent of users’ willing (PI), level of satisfaction, the image of quality and users’ past experience with the use of related innovations. Thus, librarians in addition to the system features should also focus on individual characteristics and quality of resources that probably influence adequate adoption of DL. Originality/value: In the Pakistani context, this study is the first attempt that examined the relationship of PI, the usability of DL and quality of digital resources with users’ satisfaction. Research model of this study can be used in future research. Also, this study extended the scope of theories of adoption towards DL.",Khan A.; Masrek M.; Mahmood K.,Journal,Digital Library Perspectives,2019-02-04,University of the Punjab;University of Peshawar;Universiti Teknologi MARA,Adoption theories ;  Digital libraries ;  Evaluative study ;  Innovations and technologies ;  Users satisfaction ;  Users studies

An Intelligent System for Sequencing Product Innovation Activities in Hotels,"Touristic innovation is understood as the implementation of new or improved products, processes, organization and marketing practices, that consider the non-lineal behavior and the knowledge generation. Although the related literature globally establishes the activities that should be contained in an innovation procedure to obtain new and improved products, there are not definitive guidelines regarding the order that should follow the execution of this activities. The current research fills this gap by presenting a framework for sequencing innovation activities in hotels. Specifically, the framework at first introduces the use of association rules to match the features of the hotel and the set of activities to execute. Afterwards, we propose an extension of the Borda rule for generating the sequence of the activities to execute, guaranteeing a trade-off between the generality and the singularity of such sequence. The paper includes the development of a case study to show the application of the presented framework in a real scenario. Finally, the paper concludes with the brief presentation of a software developed to allow the use of the proposal by the final managers in hotels.",Carballo-Cruz E.; Yera R.; Carballo-Ramos E.; Betancourt M.,Journal,IEEE Latin America Transactions,2019-02-01,University of Ciego de A Vila,Borda rule ;  case study ;  sequence generation ;  software tool ;  touristic innovation activities

Performance improvement and hardware implementation of Open Flow switch using FPGA,"The architecture of current networks is static and nonprogrammable. In Software-Defined Networking (SDN) it is possible to have programmability and innovation within the network. In SDN, data plane and control plane are separated. So, the network operators can manage the network behavior using software. Some standardized interfaces such as OpenFlow are developed to enable the interaction among the controller and switches. OpenFlow switch manages the network traffic at the data plane. Packet parser is one of the main parts of OpenFlow switch. So far, some FPGA implementations have been presented for packet parsers for the SDN which lack required flexibility and programmability. These implementations support only one parse graph which causes limitations in creating new network protocols for new versions of the OpenFlow switch. To address this problem, in the present study the automatic generation of a programmable packet parser is presented for the OpenFlow switch. In addition to creating high flexibility in the switch, our proposed implementation is programmable and support different parse graph during the execution time. Simulation and implementation verify the appropriate performance of this programmable parser in OpenFlow Switch. Our implementation is able to improve the performance of the switch and enhance the flexibility of the data plane of SDN. The use of the programmable packet parser results in the increase in the switch speed, the reduction in wait time and service time, and the improvement in the Openflow switch performance.",Yazdinejad A.; Bohlooli A.; Jamshidi K.,Conference Proceeding,"2019 IEEE 5th Conference on Knowledge Based Engineering and Innovation, KBEI 2019",2019-02-01,University of Isfahan,FPGA ;  Genesis ;  OpenFlow ;  Packet parser ;  SDN
Transmission of Multimedia Content between Social Networks without Reloading,"Nowadays, while increasing variety of online social networks (OSNs), content management has become harder. The paper suggests social media pages' managers to publish their contents, including the composition of image, video or text, only once on a OSN and then contents will simply transfer to other OSNs with an add-on software without having to re-use the internet traffic. Suggested method has more high performance than similar ones on any OSN. Also, the proposed technique makes it possible to transmit content between OSNs belonged to different companies. In this study, due to the availability of suitable facilities in both OSNs of Telegram and Instagram, an intermediary software, was implemented under the Android operating system and this action was carried out for the transmission media from the Instagram OSN to the Telegram channels or groups. This study contains three innovations than related researches. The first one is transmission content with the least usage of Internet traffic between OSNs which are not supported by one company. The next innovation is a caching software system to reduce processes of extracting contents from source OSN's network. The third item is transmission delay time decreased sharply. As a result, the trial version has served users and managers of pages and channels, including the official Telegram channel of a TV program named 90 and a news feed named CANNews (the analytical aviation industry news feed). Overall, this method not only has 98.81% correct action, but also contents are fitted into the post format of the destination OSN.",Nikkar K.; Parseh M.; Ebrahim Samie M.,Conference Proceeding,"2019 IEEE 5th Conference on Knowledge Based Engineering and Innovation, KBEI 2019",2019-02-01,Jahrom University,Content Transmission ;  Manage Social Media Pages ;  Publish Multimedia Data ;  Saving Internet Usage ;  Social Networking

Low carbon technology innovation strategy of manufacturer under different market power structure,"To analyze the influence of different market power structure on low carbon technology innovation strategy in a supply market consisting of a low carbon product manufacturer (LM) and an ordinary product manufacturer (HM), the decision game models under three different situations, in which LM was market leader (LL), HM was market leader (HL) and no market leader (NL) were developed respectively. The results showed that the low carbon technology innovation level was negatively related to the innovation cost coefficient, and was positively related to the government subsidy; the government's innovative subsidies for manufacturers of low carbon products could share the inputs and risks of enterprises in the early stages of innovation; low carbon technology innovation level of LL mode was the best, NL mode followed and HL mode lowest; when low carbon technology innovation risk compensation was relatively large, LM should adopt active attack strategy, conversely, adopt active defense strategy; when innovation cost coefficient was lower, HM should adopt market share strategy, conversely, adopt active defense strategy.",Yu C.; Wang C.; Gao P.,Journal,"Jisuanji Jicheng Zhizao Xitong/Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems, CIMS",2019-02-01,Jiangsu University of Technology;Shanghai Maritime University;Jiangsu University,Government subsidy ;  Low carbon ;  Power structure ;  Stackelberg game ;  Technology innovation strategy
Perspective on how regulators can keep pace with innovation: Outcomes of a European Regulatory Preparedness Workshop on nanomaterials and nano-enabled products,"The rapid pace of nanotechnology innovation has created a gap between the pace of innovation and the pace of developing nano-specific risk governance. In order to identify how to minimize this gap, a Workshop on Regulatory Preparedness for Innovation in Nanotechnology was hosted by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre in 2017 under the European Union (EU)project NanoReg2. It was attended by regulators from the EU and the United States of America (USA), industry representatives and non-governmental organizations. The Regulatory Preparedness concept under development aspires to improve the anticipation capabilities of regulators and risk assessors and to facilitate the development of adaptable (safety)legislation that can keep up with the pace of nanomaterial and nano-enabled product innovation. Based on the outcome of the workshop, a multifaceted framework was proposed to support the development of such adaptable safety legislation.

"Let the “A” in WASH stand for air: Integrating research and interventions to improve household air pollution (HAP) and water, sanitation and hygiene (waSH) in low-income settings","BACKGROUND: Research often suffers from overspecialization, a practice nurtured in academia and reinforced by funders. Indeed, investigators in household air pollution (HAP) and water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH), working in poor parts of the world, rarely interact despite having similar training and using similar methods to evaluate interventions in the same vulnerable populations. Disappointing results from recent trials of improved cookstoves and traditional approaches to WaSH suggest the need for alternative approaches. OBJECTIVES: We argue that bringing these two areas together would improve the effectiveness and efficiency of interventions to reduce the massive disease burden associated with HAP and poor WaSH, including pneumonia and diarrhea, the leading killers of young children in low-income countries. RESULTS: HAP and WaSH face similar challenges in designing, implementing, and securing the sustained and exclusive use of scalable interventions such as clean fuel and water. DISCUSSION: Research can advance greater coordination of these areas by demonstrating their interactions and wider impacts on well-being as well as the potential for programmatic synergies. Integrated solutions to clean households and communities can benefit from the contribution in multiple disciplines, including economics and policy analysis; business and finance; engineering and technology; lab sciences, environmental health, and biomedical sciences; and behavioral and implementation sciences. CONCLUSION: There are compelling reasons to overcome the artificial and unproductive segregation of HAP and WaSH. Researchers should encourage integration by expanding the scope of their collaborations and projects. Policy makers, funders, and implementers can help by supporting compre-hensive solutions, encouraging innovation, and requiring rigorous evaluations of their effects.",Clasen T.; Smith K.,Journal,Environmental Health Perspectives,2019-02-01,"Rollins School of Public Health;University of California, Berkeley;Collaborative Clean Air Policy Centre",

Innovating Cancer Care Delivery: the Example of the 4R Oncology Model for Colorectal Cancer Patients,"Care delivery innovation is necessary to address the growing complexity of cancer care across specialties and integrate new diagnostics, treatments, and services into care delivery. Informed by Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR), multilevel intervention research, and other disciplines, this article describes the 4-step cancer care delivery innovation cycle. The cycle guides collaborative efforts of cancer clinicians, researchers, patients, and other stakeholders to systematically define care delivery problems and formulate, test, and implement care innovations to effectively address problems. We illustrate the 4 steps of the innovation cycle with the example of developing the 4R Oncology Model for colorectal cancer (4R is Right Information and Right Care for the Right Patient at the Right Time). The 4R is a multilevel intervention informed by CCDR, the team science, and lessons learned from other models, such as survivorship care planning. We offer additional considerations for balancing the need to innovate with concerns about constrained resources and overextended workforce.

Nanoparticles: Their synthesis and their applications,"Nanotechnology has become one of the most promising technologies applied in all areas of science. Metal nanoparticles produced by nanotechnology have received global attention due to their extensive applications in the biomedical and physiochemical fields. Recently, synthesizing metal nanoparticles using microorganisms and plants has been extensively studied and has been recognized as a green and efficient way for further exploiting microorganisms as convenient nanofactories. Here, we explore and detail the potential uses of various biological sources for nanoparticle synthesis and the application of those nanoparticles. Nanobiology is a new discipline that integrates fundamental research in biology, physics, engineering and the biomedical sciences. The use of nanoparticles in the biomedical sciences opens the doors to the delivery of new, more potent, effective and better targeted agents to the cell, enabling the development of new strategies for improving human health. The peculiar nature and the novelty of nanoparticles' chemistry demand the proper characterization of the nanoparticles functional building blocks and the common patterns relating chemically diverse moieties.

Measuring the knowledge translation and convergence in pharmaceutical innovation by funding-science-technology-innovation linkages analysis,"We propose a backward tracking model for measuring knowledge transfer in the whole translational research spectrum. Using the drugs-patents-papers-grants backward linkages, we try to figure out the funding-science-technology-innovation translational pattern and ponder some policy implications on e.g., which priority areas and knowledge convergence level are more likely to generate new drugs. The drug-patent linkage data was accessed through the USFDA Orange Book, covering a drug's active ingredient, formulation, or methods of use for approved indications. It will take about 10 years from the application of earliest patent to the approval of the new drug. Also such high-value patents in FDA Orange Book tend to cite scientific knowledge published on average 10-15 years ago. The technology linkage of new drugs was relatively stable while the science linkage of technology inventions increased rapidly. Among the scientific papers cited by drug patents, private-institution originated papers are only a quarter of the public. By linking theses scientific papers with funding sources, we found a large majority (90%) are public-funded and only a very small part are private-funded or public-private joint-funded. Our study also indicates the importance of research on such fields as pharmacology, chemistry (including medicinal chemistry, biochemistry, and organic chemistry), molecular biology, neurosciences, and immunology on new drugs innovation. There is no obvious relationship between ""basicness"" and linkages to the resulting patents' impact and to drugs innovation. A balanced basic research and applied research maybe essential for fostering drug innovation because it is a complete chain translating from basic discovery to clinical evidence then to clinical practice. In order to achieve successful pharmaceutical innovation, rather than focusing on only technology, convergence with science at moderate levels (maybe 1/3) is suggested.",Du J.; Li P.; Guo Q.; Tang X.,Journal,Journal of Informetrics,2019-02-01,"Institute of Medical Information & Library, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College",FDA Orange book ;  Non-patent literature ;  Science policy ;  Scientometric analysis ;  Translational research
Research on partner combination selection of the supply chain collaborative product innovation based on product innovative resources,"With the transformation from traditional innovation to open innovation, supply chain collaborative product innovation has become a new and promising product innovation model for companies. Partner selection as the primary link of collaborative product innovation in supply chain is the key problem to be solved in its operation management. At present, the research on partner selection of the supply chain mainly focuses on single partner selection. The focus of the evaluation is on the supply chain operation and collaboration capabilities. This is difficult to meet the requirements of supply chain collaborative product innovation on partner combinations. Therefore, according to the objectives and characteristics of supply chain collaborative product innovation, this paper constructs a supply chain collaborative product innovation partner selection index system based on innovative resources, and designs the method to determine the innovative resource attribute weights and supply and demand weights. Considering the capabilities of the alternative partners themselves, the conflicts between different partners, and the complementarity of the innovative resources, a scientific and rational partner combination selection process and method is proposed, and an example calculation is used to verify the advancement and practicality.",Lv B.; Qi X.,Journal,Computers and Industrial Engineering,2019-02-01,TianJin University of Technology and Education;Tianjin Normal University,Collaborative product innovation ;  Innovative resources ;  Partner combination
Three-dimensional printing biotechnology for the regeneration of the tooth and tooth-supporting tissues,"The tooth and its supporting tissues are organized with complex three-dimensional (3D) architecture, including the dental pulp with a blood supply and nerve tissues, complex multilayer periodontium, and highly aligned periodontal ligament (PDL). Mimicking such 3D complexity and the multicellular interactions naturally existing in dental structures represents great challenges in dental regeneration. Attempts to construct the complex system of the tooth and tooth-supporting apparatus (i.e., the PDL, alveolar bone, and cementum) have made certain progress owing to 3D printing biotechnology. Recent advances have enabled the 3D printing of biocompatible materials, seed cells, and supporting components into complex 3D functional living tissue. Furthermore, 3D bioprinting is driving major innovations in regenerative medicine, giving the field of regenerative dentistry a boost. The fabrication of scaffolds via 3D printing is already being performed extensively at the laboratory bench and in clinical trials; however, printing living cells and matrix materials together to produce tissue constructs by 3D bioprinting remains limited to the regeneration of dental pulp and the tooth germ. This review summarizes the application of scaffolds for cell seeding and biofabricated tissues via 3D printing and bioprinting, respectively, in the tooth and its supporting tissues. Additionally, the key advantages and prospects of 3D bioprinting in regenerative dentistry are highlighted, providing new ideas for dental regeneration.",Ma Y.; Xie L.; Yang B.; Tian W.,Journal,Biotechnology and Bioengineering,2019-02-01,West China School/Hospital of Stomatology Sichuan University,3D bioprinting ;  3D printing ;  biofabrication ;  biotechnology ;  scaffolds ;  tissue engineering ;  tooth regeneration
The local embedding of low carbon technologies and the agency of user-side intermediaries,"‘Local embedding’ is a term increasingly used by transition researchers but in a variety of ways. As a concept it is emotive but lacks clarity. The first contribution of this paper is to explore and substantiate the concept of local embedding by drawing on three theoretical fields: socio-technical transitions, domestication studies and research on innovation intermediaries. Emphasis is placed on the work required to integrate low carbon technologies into local contexts of use by aligning multiple system elements into configurations that work. This points to a particular form of actor – those performing relational work between multiple actors and technologies, commonly known as intermediaries – as being central to the process. Three key intermediary processes – of facilitating, configuring and brokering - are thought to define the work that intermediary organisations do. Nonetheless, understanding how these key intermediary processes relate as well as the agency of intermediary organisations in local embedding is still largely uncharted territory. The paper's second contribution is the development of a process perspective on the agency of intermediary organisations in local embedding. The resulting perspective offers a means to situate and understand the agency of user-side intermediaries in local embedding and insights into later phases of transition processes.",Barnes J.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2019-02-01,University of Sussex,Domestication ;  Innovation intermediaries ;  Intermediary organisations ;  Local embedding ;  Socio-technical transitions
Using agent-based modelling to investigate diffusion of mobile-based branchless banking services in a developing country,"Branchless Banking Services (BBS) were launched in 2009 in Pakistan with the promise of providing banking services to the unbanked. Since then the overall size of BBS has grown. Despite the popularity of the over-the-counter (OTC) channel, growth in m-wallets or mobile accounts (MA) has been slow. We investigate diffusion of MA through the development of an agent-based simulation model that captures the dynamics of the multi-sided BBS platform market. We identify important factors that drive MA diffusion and illustrate main and interaction effects between these factors. Furthermore, we examine how the relative effects of the different sides of the market have evolved over the course of the MA diffusion across both rural and urban consumer segments. The proposed model helps to understand the dynamics of diffusion of an important financial technology innovation. It can also serve as the starting point for future -research on technology diffusion in multi-sided markets.",Zaffar M.; Kumar R.; Zhao K.,Journal,Decision Support Systems,2019-02-01,Suleman Dawood School of Business;The University of North Carolina at Charlotte,Agent-based modelling ;  Branchless banking ;  Innovation diffusion
Undesirable and desirable energy congestion measurements for regional coal-fired power generation industry in China,"The blind expansion and increasing carbon emissions of the coal-fired power generation industry in China have attracted wide attention at home and abroad. To detect the technical ineffectiveness in the coal-fired power generation industry and the effects of carbon emission reductions, this study developed energy congestion models using data envelopment analysis (DEA). Energy congestion is classified into undesirable energy congestion (UEC) and desirable energy congestion (DEC) under natural disposability and managerial disposability. The UEC and DEC models were used to identify energy congestion, measure the amounts of UEC and DEC, and analyze the sources of inefficiency for regional coal-fired generation industry in China from 2004 to 2013. Our empirical analysis revealed: i) The UEC of coal-fired generation industry has occurred in many regions, most of which are less-developed areas. This indicates that energy is wasted in coal-fired generation industry due to congestion inefficiency. ii) DEC has occurred in a few regions and did not occur in 2013. These provinces where DEC occurred may have a high potential for eco-technology innovation. The method of energy congestion measurement proposed in this study and the research conclusion have reference effect on regional energy conservation and eco-technology innovation.",Chen Z.; Li J.; Zhao W.; Yuan X.; Yang G.,Journal,Energy Policy,2019-02-01,"Institutes of Science and Development;School of Economics and Management, USTB;Henan University of Economics and Law;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;Zhengzhou University;Beijing Institute of Technology",Desirable energy congestion ;  Energy congestion ;  Managerial disposability ;  Natural disposability ;  Undesirable energy congestion

New detected uncertainties in the design of foundations for offshore Wind Turbines,"In 2014, the Renewable Energy Journal published innovative research where the authors showed the results obtained in work where the design of support structures and foundations in marine based wind farms were questioned. The uncertainties in the design were then justified by the “limited” field experience and in the review of the standards and recommendations existing at that time. Fundamentally, an analysis was made of the ratio between useful life and the probability of failure, the wave theories to be used, the hydrodynamics of Morison, Froude-Krylov and diffraction domains, together with the scouring phenomena processes and consequent protection of structural items. Using the knowledge gained during these three years, the research work herein presented covers further reflections such as the nonlinearity in wave mechanics, its effects on orbital seabed velocities, variation in the behaviour of the Keulegan-Carpenter number (KC), impact on scour in the KC-6 equation, the analysis of statistics of forces applied to load combinations in structures at depths in excess of fifty metres, taking giant steps in offshore engineering and leaving behind classical maritime engineering techniques.",Luengo J.; Negro V.; García-Barba J.; López-Gutiérrez J.; Esteban M.,Journal,Renewable Energy,2019-02-01,Universidad Politécnica de Madrid;Universitat d'Alacant,Gravity based structures ;  Monopiles ;  Offshore wind farms ;  Recommendations ;  Technical standards
"Same but different? Research and technology organizations, universities and the innovation activities of firms","Research and Technology Organizations (RTOs) and universities are important elements of countries’ innovation systems. As they are both halfway between science and industry, they are often considered to be the same thing. However, recent studies have stressed the differences between the two. In this paper, we analyze the innovative characteristics (impacts and types of innovation and internal R&D investments) of firms that collaborate with RTOs versus universities. Our study is based on statistical analysis of Community Innovation Survey micro-data (CIS 2012). Our results suggest that firms that see RTOs as more important sources of knowledge than universities have a higher probability of developing service innovation, invest less in internal R&D but are less likely to introduce new, groundbreaking innovations into the market. These results have significant policy and management implications, especially regarding the different but complementary contributions offered respectively by RTOs and universities.",Giannopoulou E.; Barlatier P.; Pénin J.,Journal,Research Policy,2019-02-01,Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology;Université de Strasbourg,Open innovation ;  Research and technology organizations (RTOs) ;  Research collaborations ;  Universities ;  University-industry linkages
Persistent heterogeneity of R&D intensities within sectors: Evidence and policy implications,"Do firms in the same sector converge towards the same R&D intensities? Previous research has often assumed this to be true. A closer examination, using microdata from the EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard for the years 2000–2015, shows considerable heterogeneity in R&D intensities among firms in the same sector, and that this heterogeneity persists over time. Statistical tests of convergence show that the variation in R&D intensities does not decrease over time (i.e. no σ-convergence), although firms with an R&D intensity below the industry average do seem to catch up with the leaders (i.e. evidence of β-convergence). Overall, firms in the same industry do not converge to a common R&D intensity.

A new jig-shape optimization method for the high aspect ratio wing,"Purpose: Computational efficiency is always the major concern in aircraft design. The purpose of this research is to investigate an efficient jig-shape optimization design method. A new jig-shape optimization method is presented in the current study and its application on the high aspect ratio wing is discussed. Design/methodology/approach: First, the effects of bending and torsion on aerodynamic distribution were discussed. The effect of bending deformation was equivalent to the change of attack angle through a new equivalent method. The equivalent attack angle showed a linear dependence on the quadratic function of bending. Then, a new jig-shape optimization method taking integrated structural deformation into account was proposed. The method was realized by four substeps: object decomposition, optimization design, inversion and evaluation. Findings: After the new jig-shape optimization design, both aerodynamic distribution and structural configuration have satisfactory results. Meanwhile, the method takes both bending and torsion deformation into account. Practical implications: The new jig-shape optimization method can be well used for the high aspect ratio wing. Originality/value: The new method is an innovation based on the traditional single parameter design method. It is suitable for engineering application.",Yuan Z.; Huo S.; Ren J.,Journal,Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology,2019-01-30,Northwestern Polytechnical University;Science and Technology on Liquid Rocket Engine Laboratory,Aerodynamic distribution ;  High aspect ratio wing ;  Jig-shape optimization method ;  Static aeroelasticity ;  Structural deformation

Environmental regulations an option: Asymmetry effect of environmental regulations on carbon emissions using non-linear ARDL,"The current study reported the asymmetry effect of environmental regulations in the presence of controlled variables such as research and development spending, urban population growth, energy consumption, and financial development on carbon emissions in case of China for the period of 1991–2015. Econometric techniques such as ADF and PP is used to check the stationarity of the data while asymmetry or non-linear ARDL is used to check the asymmetry. The results suggest symmetric or linear relationship between environmental regulations and carbon emissions. Linear ARDL is applied to check long-run and short-run relationship amongst the variables. The results verified that there exists negative and statistically significant relationship exists both in short and long-run between environmental regulation and carbon emissions. Similarly, research and development and financial development also improve carbon emissions. However, urban population growth and energy consumption increase carbon emissions. The study further suggests that sustainable, green urbanization, green credit concept to promote sustainable financial development, innovation in technology through research and development and current environmental regulation should be strengthening to achieve China 2030 target of reducing carbon emissions.",Khan Z.; Sisi Z.; Siqun Y.,Journal,"Energy Sources, Part A: Recovery, Utilization and Environmental Effects",2019-01-17,Tsinghua University,Carbon emissions ;  environmental regulation ;  financial development ;  non-linear ARDL ;  symmetric

Innovation of agricultural engineering management in pursuing rural revitalization strategy in China,"Agricultural engineering plays a key role in agricultural and rural modernization. Innovation in agricultural engineering management should promote the prosperity of rural industry, promote the well-off life of farmers, and improve the level of ecological livability, and it is an important way to implement the strategy of rural revitalization. At present, agricultural engineering management system in China has not been effectively established, engineering management lags behind technology management, and the main roles do not fully act their functions. The management of agricultural engineering should be improved urgently, and the management efficiency should be improved urgently. In agricultural infrastructure engineering, agricultural mechanization engineering, protected agriculture engineering, agricultural products processing and storage engineering, agricultural products circulation engineering, resource and environmental protection engineering, agricultural information engineering and other major agricultural engineerings, management should be innovated by using the integrated methodology. The solution of a series of complex scientific problems in the agricultural engineering management needs the guidance of methodology, which is the integration and development of modern scientific methodology in agricultural engineering management. Focusing on the important demands of rural revitalization, the 'four-all' management system was proposed in this paper, which means the all-systems integration, all-factors integration, all-links optimization and all-department coordination in agricultural engineering. This system was used to analyze 3 key parts of agricultural engineering management which were target management, process management and dynamic control. In target management, various complex environmental factors, such as nature, society, humanity, technology and so on should be considered comprehensively. The overall objectives of agricultural engineering should be continuously controlled, coordinated and optimized. In the process management, considering the multi-department and multi-interest demands of the government, enterprises, scientific research institutions and farmers, emphasis should be placed on engineering practice, incentive and restraint mechanisms should be institutionalized in the whole process of agricultural planning, design, implementation, operation and retirement. In dynamic control, the external risks such as market risk, natural risk, technological risk, financial risk and engineering self risks should be faced, and feed forward control, field control and feedback control should be combined. Finally, specific suggestions on strengthening top-level design of agricultural engineering, division roles and coordination among departments, legislative construction, supervision and evaluation were put forward. This methodology system is expected to provide reference for agricultural engineering management.",Zhu M.; Sui B.; Qi F.; Yang Z.,Journal,Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering,2019-01-15,Chinese Academy of Agricultural Engineering,Agricultural engineering ;  Innovation ;  Management ;  Rural revitalization strategy
4D Printing based piezoelectric composite for medical applications,"Additive manufacturing (AM), otherwise known as three-dimensional (3D) printing, is driving major innovations in many areas, such as engineering, manufacturing, art, education, and medicine. Although a considerable amount of progress has been made in this field, additional research work is required to overcome various remaining challenges. Recently, one of the actively researched areas lies in the AM of smart materials and structures. Electroactive materials incorporated in 3D printing have given birth to 4D printing, where 3D printed structures can perform as actuating and/or sensing systems, making it possible to deliver electrical signals under external mechanical stimuli and vice versa. In this paper, we present a lightweight, low cost piezoelectric material based on the dispersion of inorganic ferroelectric submicron particles in a polymer matrix. We report on how the proposed material is compatible with the AM process.

Soil and water bioengineering: Practice and research needs for reconciling natural hazard control and ecological restoration,"Soil and water bioengineering is a technology that encourages scientists and practitioners to combine their knowledge and skills in the management of ecosystems with a common goal to maximize benefits to both man and the natural environment. It involves techniques that use plants as living building materials, for: (i) natural hazard control (e.g., soil erosion, torrential floods and landslides) and (ii) ecological restoration or nature-based re-introduction of species on degraded lands, river embankments, and disturbed environments. For a bioengineering project to be successful, engineers are required to highlight all the potential benefits and ecosystem services by documenting the technical, ecological, economic and social values. The novel approaches used by bioengineers raise questions for researchers and necessitate innovation from practitioners to design bioengineering concepts and techniques. Our objective in this paper, therefore, is to highlight the practice and research needs in soil and water bioengineering for reconciling natural hazard control and ecological restoration. Firstly, we review the definition and development of bioengineering technology, while stressing issues concerning the design, implementation, and monitoring of bioengineering actions.

The study adopted a quasi-experimental pretest and posttest research design. The educational experiment lasted for 6 weeks. The research participants comprised 57 ninth-grade students from a public high school in Taiwan. The students employed either a tablet computer or laptop computer to engage in weekly 3-h laboratory studies. A criterion test was developed to measure student knowledge of electrical engineering. The results revealed that the instructional effectiveness was identical for all the students, regardless of whether they used a tablet or laptop computer. However, those using the tablet computers achieved greater learning improvement. In addition, the qualitative data indicated that the tablet computers facilitated student learning in various engineering learning activities.

The Systematic Project Involving Brazes Development and Intelligent Brazing Technology Innovation: a Materials Genome Perspective,"In recent years, the conventional material research methodologies depending on scientific intuition and trial and error have been increasingly regarded as the bottleneck for development and technological advance of manufacturing industry. Then, the innovation on material research methodology has become the international new trend of materials research and development. Materials genome technology is considered as a giant leap of materials S&T and the accelerator of new material development. The complexity and randomicity of brazing process make the design and development of brazing materials more complicated and time-consuming than ordinary materials. Materials genome initiative, as a brand new concept for advanced materials development, should also be adopted to the performance optimization and development of new brazing materials. This is of great significance to promote the rapid development of welding technology, especially intelligent welding. The three main facets of materials genome technology are high-throughput material computation, high-throughput material experimentation and material basic data. Large-scale high-throughput computation can provide abundant and systematic data. High-throughput material experimentation can quickly verify these data. Moreover, the establishment of the material database can realize (i) the effective integration of calculated data with experimental data, and (ii) their mutual complementation and mutual verification. These three elements work together and then contribute to a more close relationship between theoretical and experimental research in the process of material development. This can shorten the period of research, manufacturing and application, and reduces the development cost of new materials. In addition to the performance of material itself, developing new brazing materials also need to consider (i) physical and chemical compatibility of brazing materials and base materials, (ii) interaction (diffusion and formation of new phase) between brazing materials and base materials during brazing process. The interaction between brazing materials and base materials is very complex, as it not only depends on the brazing process (temperature, holding time, pressure, atmosphere, etc.), but is directly related to the composition of brazes and base materials. Therefore, compared with ordinary materials, the design and development of brazing materials require a more complicated methodology and a more time-consuming course. And the initiation of brazing materials genome project is of great urgency. This relies to a considerable degree on the satisfactory achievement towards three essential engineering issues, i.e. development of high-throughput computing software, high-throughput experimental methodologies and data integration system. The development of intelligent welding at present has focused mostly on fusion welding, e.g. arc welding, laser welding, etc., and has also acquired notable achievements. However, the full-intelligent control technology for brazing still lies at a fairly primitive level, and the current researches concentrate mainly on brazing equipment and brazing process control. The brazing materials play an important role in intelligent brazing. So the brazing materials genome project can facilitate the intelligentization of brazing technology. In return, the advancement of intelligent brazing will also advance the course of brazing materials genome project, as it will greatly simplify and accelerate the performance examination upon new designed brazes, and in addition, it will help to collect more real-time data for the numerous artificially created brazes. This paper discusses the three basic elements of materials genome technology and the corresponding global research status. It also analyzes the influence factors and key common problems for the adoption of materials genome technology to brazing materials development, and states dialectically the mutually reinforcing relationship between brazes genome project and intelligent brazing technology.",He P.; Lin P.,Journal,Cailiao Daobao/Materials Review,2019-01-10,Harbin Institute of Technology,Brazes ;  High-throughput computation ;  High-throughput experimentation ;  Intelligent brazing ;  Material basic data ;  Materials genome
The State of the Art of Hydrogen Storage Materials for High-pressure Hybrid Hydrogen Vessel,"Hydrogen energy is one of the most important choices for realizing clean energy because of its wide sources, no pollution, and high energy density. The technological innovation of fuel cells contributes to the attractive prospect of hydrogen energy in vehicles, but the problem of hydrogen filling and hydrogen storage has become one of the obstacles to the development of hydrogen energy cars. The safe and efficient hydrogen storage is crucial for the large-scale application of hydrogen energy. Till now there have been developed three main hydrogen storage methods, which include high-pressure gaseous hydrogen storage, low-temperature liquid hydrogen storage and solid-state hydrogen storage. The gravimetric density of gaseous hydrogen storage system can be promoted by increasing the pressure of hydrogen and the specific strength of container material. However, H2 molecular interaction causes a relatively low volumetric density of gaseous hydrogen storage system, and excessively high hydrogen pressure challenges the safety and heightens design difficulty and cost of hydrogen tanks. The liquid hydrogen storage owns ideal gravimetric and volumetric density, which can be realized by compres-sing and liquefying hydrogen gas. However, liquid hydrogen is particularly prone to volatilize and liquid hydrogen container requires strict storing conditions. In addition, the liquefying process of gaseous hydrogen is uneconomical, as it consumes an energy quantity that constitutes about 40% of the combustion heat release of the stored hydrogen. For the solid-state hydrogen storage, hydrogen is stored in the hydrides in the form of atom or ion. Hence, the solid-state hydrogen storage obtains an impressively high volumetric density and enjoys greater security because the hydrogen storage materials absorb/desorb hydrogen at mild conditions. But the gravimetric density of hydrogen storage materials is comparatively low. The high-pressure hybrid hydrogen storage vessel, which combines the advantages of gaseous and solid-state hydrogen storage methods, offers a feasible path to safe and high-density hydrogen storage. The volumetric density of high-pressure hydrogen tank can be effectively enhanced by the hydrogen storage materials, resulting in lower operating pressure, smaller volume, and higher safety. The performance promotion of the high-pressure hybrid hydrogen storage vessels depends upon the development of materials with excellent hydrogen sorption performances under high hydrogen pressure. The AB2 type ZrFe2-based and TiCr2 based alloys are the currently prevailing high-pressure hydrogen storage materials. Though researchers mainly concentrate on and have achieved the regulation of storage capacity, absorption/desorption pressure plateau and kinetics through the alloying trials which partially substitute elements with various atomic radius and electronic structures for either A-site or B-site, the gravimetric densities of ZrFe2-based and TiCr2-based alloys are still unsatisfactory. NaAlH4 and AlH3 display considerable potential as candidate storage materials owing to their intrinsically high storage density. For NaAlH4, sufficient works have preliminarily confirmed the effectiveness of nanosizing and catalyst-doping toward dehydrogenation temperature reduction and cyclic stability enhancement. And the yield of AlH3 along with its crystallinity can likely be enhanced by adopting ball milling or improving the solvent. This review starts with a brief introduction of how the high-pressure hybrid hydrogen storage vessel works and a summary of the performance requirements of the hydrogen storage materials. It then provides detailed discussion and description upon the structure, characteristics and research status quo with respect to the above-mentioned two species of high-pressure hydrogen storage materials, i.e.hydrogen storage alloys (ZrFe2, TiCr2) and aluminum based complex hydrides (NaAlH4, AlH3).",Zhou C.; Wang H.; Ouyang L.; Zhu M.,Journal,Cailiao Daobao/Materials Review,2019-01-10,South China University of Technology,High-pressure hybrid hydrogen storage vessel ;  High-pressure hydrogen storage material ;  Solid-state hydrogen storage ;  TiCr 2 ;  ZrFe 2
"Augmented reality in science classroom: Perceived effects in education, visualization and information processing","Technology in education has evolved over the decades and has provided more opportunities for technologies such as Augmented Reality to find its way into the pedagogy of teachers in science. In this paper, an AR app was used in facilitating a lesson on chemical bonding and simple compounds. The effects of such innovation were studied using observation and various data gathering methods in an action research design. Results show that AR is a tool that enhances visualization of concepts through elements of virtual and real images, allows students to map physical characteristics easily and aids them in developing mental images for further discourse. Results also show that AR does not only improve motivation but triggers more student-student interaction and teacher-student interaction as well. Students learning attitudes towards chemistry improved in terms of their appreciation of the subject, their perception of its relation to real life and of their meaning-making processes. The teacher indicated that AR apps can innovate the classroom and can provide opportunities for implementation as they are easy to use. However, findings also show that teachers may have a hard time looking for free resources of apps that will meet their needs, and that there is challenge in ensuring that misconceptions are avoided from AR apps' oversimplification of visualization. This study also presents some action plans for further use of AR apps in teaching science.",Virata R.; Castro J.,Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2019-01-10,St. Scholastica's College,21  century e-learning st ;  Augmented reality ;  Chemistry education ;  K12 science ;  Science education

Critical Considerations on the Clinical Translation of Upconversion Nanoparticles (UCNPs): Recommendations from the European Upconversion Network (COST Action CM1403),"The unique photoluminescent properties of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have attracted worldwide research interest and inspired many bioanalytical applications. The anti-Stokes emission with long luminescence lifetimes, narrow and multiple absorption and emission bands, and excellent photostability enable background-free and multiplexed detection in deep tissues. So far, however, in vitro and in vivo applications of UCNPs are restricted to the laboratory use due to safety concerns. Possible harmful effects may originate from the chemical composition but also from the small size of UCNPs. Potential end users must rely on well-founded safety data. Thus, a risk to benefit assessment of the envisioned combined therapeutic and diagnostic (“theranostic”) applications is fundamentally important to bridge the translational gap between laboratory and clinics. The COST Action CM1403 “The European Upconversion Network—From the Design of Photon-Upconverting Nanomaterials to Biomedical Applications” integrates research on UCNPs ranging from fundamental materials synthesis and research, detection instrumentation, biofunctionalization, and bioassay development to toxicity testing. Such an interdisciplinary approach is necessary for a better and safer theranostic use of UCNPs.

After eight years of experience and three continuous, cyclical improvement processes, the study argues that the Sustainability Report has contributed in outstanding fashion to: i) disseminate and internalize the mission of the center and its alignment with sustainability principles; ii) establish new and robust communication mechanisms with stakeholders, encouraging their participation in management decision-making processes iii) integrate the indicators of sustainability impact in the global management plan; and iv) develop a more comprehensive and strategic vision of the institution, which is now shared among key positions.",Yáñez S.; Uruburu Á.; Moreno A.; Lumbreras J.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2019-01-10,Universidad Politécnica de Madrid,Institutions of higher education ;  Sustainability report ;  Sustainability reporting process ;  Sustainable development
"Design and poverty: a review of contexts, roles of poor people, and methods","Design is essential to fulfil unmet or under-served needs of resource-poor societies, supporting their social and human development. A great deal of design research has been undertaken in such low resource settings, and is discussed under different names, such as ‘community development engineering’, ‘humanitarian engineering’, ‘appropriate technology’, ‘design for development’, ‘design at the Base of the Pyramid’, etc. This has created an important need to know what has been examined and learnt so far and to plan for further investigation. To address this, we review a broad range of literature, with close examination of 30 design studies in this field. This reveals a multifaceted picture, showing a great diversity in investigation and reporting of attributes of context (income, rural and urban, design sectors, countries, and gender), the roles of poor people (consumers, producers, and co-designers), characteristics of research methods employed (e.g. descriptive and prescriptive, data collection methods, qualitative and quantitative aspects, and unit of analysis), and design topics. Based on the review results, we offer recommendations for further research, identifying concerns that researchers ought to have about this field and suggesting ways in which research in this field can be undertaken and reported.",Jagtap S.,Journal,Research in Engineering Design,2019-01-09,Blekinge Tekniska Högskola,Design process ;  Design research ;  Developing countries ;  Frugal innovations ;  Poverty

Research and development absorptive capacity: a Māori perspective,"This paper presents a view of research and development absorptive capacity from a Māori perspective. The assessment is part of a case study of a longitudinal programme–Science for Technological Innovation: Kia kotahi mai–Te Ao Putaiao me te Ao Hanagarau that aims to increase Aotearoa New Zealand’s capacity to use sci-tech for economic benefit. The paper finds that while Aotearoa New Zealand’s macro policy and meso institutional levels have become more responsive to Māori research and development demands, at the micro level of the individual or the firm there are still constraints given the small numbers of Māori in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. In response to this, a novel model of Māori sci-tech capacity is under development that considers not only research and development technical capacities, but also the human and relational capacities required to accelerate absorptive capacity to respond to Māori social and economic aspirations.",Ruckstuhl K.; Amoamo M.; Hart N.; Martin W.; Keegan T.; Pollock R.,Journal,Kotuitui,2019-01-02,Otago Business School;Callaghan Innovation;University of Otago;The University of Waikato;Kaitiaki Creations,absorptive capacity ;  engineering and mathematics ;  māori science ;  National science Challenges ;  Research and development ;  science ;  technology
"Today’s Innovation Leaders: In a changing environment, innovation leaders need a wide range of skills to succeed and take varied paths to the role.","Overview: Today’s CTOs engage a broad set of stakeholders and provide a vision and strategy to execute within their organization. They must have versatile skillsets to be effective in guiding the company’s innovation efforts internally, with customers, and with external partners. The paths to these senior R&D innovation leadership roles vary based on the ­individual’s journey to leadership, but they reflect the range of skills required.

"A Bibliometric Study of Research-Technology Management, 1998–2017: An analysis of 20 years of RTM articles offers a perspective on trends and evolutions in the journal’s content and in the field of innovation management.","Overview: A bibliometric study of Research-Technology Management (RTM), conducted for the 20-year period 1998–2017, examined citations, authors, industry sectors, and topics for 550 articles published during the period to identify relevant trends. Along with providing guidance to prospective RTM authors and reviewers regarding the journal’s areas of focus, the study also provides an indication of the evolution in the topics most relevant to innovation and technology management practitioners. Our findings show RTM’s growing global reach—the past 20 years have seen a significant increase in the number of articles from European academic authors. The analysis suggests that scholars and practitioners look to RTM primarily for thought leadership about knowledge and portfolio management and new product development; the journal’s most-cited articles are in the field of new product development. Further, while the majority of articles are relevant across industry sectors, we find a growing proportion of articles about information technology.",Shum V.; Park A.; Maine E.; Pitt L.,Journal,Research Technology Management,2019-01-02,,Bibliometrics ;  Industry research ;  RTM history
"Safety I–II, resilience and antifragility engineering: a debate explained through an accident occurring on a mobile elevating work platform","Occupational health and safety (OHS) represents an important field of exploration for the research community: in spite of the growth of technological innovations, the increasing complexity of systems involves critical issues in terms of degradation of the safety levels. In such a situation, new safety management approaches are now mandatory in order to face the safety implications of the current technological evolutions. Along these lines, performing risk-based analysis alone seems not to be enough anymore.

Overview of Activities Aimed at Encouraging Innovation and Improvement by the Scientific-Technical Societies of the Tatar ASSR in the Late 1950s – Early 1960s,"The article focuses on the activities of the scientific-technical societies of the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR) in the second half of the 1950s – early 1960s in their efforts to enhance invention and innovation, and effectiveness of various forms of mobilization in the engineering and technical communities of factory workers. The author provides arguments in favor of the idea that the differentiated character of the structural transformations of scientific-technical societies, as well as the criteria for assessing the effectiveness of their activities, reflected the mobilization model of the Soviet economy. Realizing the mobilization functions that are not inherent in their nature and implementing speculative ideas (democratization of production), scientific-technical societies created far-fetched associations, such as worker-research institutes, public construction bureaus, public bureaus of economic analysis, and others. A key focal point is the analysis of the difficulties faced by scientific-technical associations. The most significant of which were the lack of: independence in planning the trajectory of its development, scientific personnel and effective connections with other scientific and engineering organizations. A large number of mobilization events generated the pursuit of quantity at the expense of quality. The article also discusses how the peculiarities of the command system, which was weakly susceptible to innovation and the growing discrepancy between political slogans and the realities of Soviet life, led to the profanation of the government's initiatives to develop creative activity of the working masses. In the USSR system of management of scientific and technical progress, immune to managerial influences coming from below, public organizations could not play a serious role, as a result implementing mobilization functions unusual for their nature.",Pinaeva D.,Journal,"Vestnik Novosibirskogo Gosudarstvennogo Universiteta, Seriya: Istoriya, Filologiya",2019-01-01,Kazan National Research Technical University named after A.N.

Enterprise Architecture Oriented Requirements Engineering for the Design of a School Friendly Open Data Web Interface,"Open Data is considered a key to scientific innovations. These freely available datasets can also be used as a foundation to enhance the digital and data literacies among the younger generation of school pupils. This article presents the design and prototype of an Open Data web interface based on the Enterprise Architecture Oriented Requirements Engineering (EAORE) approach for Open Data usage as an educational resource in Danish public schools. We first systematically review the literature on Open Data use in educational fields and selected 14 research articles with a particular focus on the use of Open Data in the educational domain after prescribing an inclusion/exclusion criteria on 101 research articles identified initially. The review indicates that there is a gap between Open Data opportunities within the educational domain and in exploring the use of Open Data as a source to develop twenty-first-century skills, specifically digital and data literacies among younger school pupils. To fill this gap, we propose an EAORE approach that represents how Enterprise Architecture (EA) models can guide the overall Requirements Engineering (RE) process for the use of Open Data in Danish public schools.

A PLAYGROUND FOR NOVICE ENGINEERS AND BEYOND,"The Innovation Playground is a living lab for co-creation accessible for all faculties and research programs situated in the main building of The Hague University of Applied Sciences (THUAS). It has shown to play an important role in building social, learning, and professional communities that reach beyond the intended purpose. Due to budget restrictions, the dedicated staffing and accompanying programming were eliminated. In this case, the fourth challenge on operational scheduling and staffing of the workspace, presented in the syllabus (Crawley, Malmqvist, Östlund, Brodeur, & Edström, 2014) is encountered. To avoid throwing the baby out with the bathwater, this paper captures the value of the space and programming for its users and types of usage, primary and auxiliary. It answers the key question: what needs do the Innovation Playground fulfil for all its users? It focuses on uses beyond the educational and users beyond the engineering domain. Cases and spaces of multidisciplinary education beyond the technical domain are rare to find within the CDIO body of knowledge. The CDIO framework is optimized for engineering education, yet the value of these spaces for members across an institute (such as internal research partners and external network) is overlooked with this perspective. The syllabus touches upon the community building aspects as a result of the design-implementation projects (for students and faculty staff). The valuable activities, as expressed by its users, are teaching and learning modes that contribute to community building, such as advanced and simple design-implementation projects, collaborative design projects, extracurricular design projects, tinkering mode and self-guided learning (Young et al., 2005). For non-student users, this community building value is endorsed. Other intangible values for non-student users include a space to conduct and reflect on educational innovation, cross-disciplinary educational collaborations, and expanding networks within and outside of the institute to work with real-world clients.",Sluijs J.; Duta M.; Jansen B.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International CDIO Conference,2019-01-01,The Hague University of Applied Sciences,Engineering Workspaces ;  Learning Environments ;  Relationships between Academia and Industry ;  Standards: 6
Young Researcher Programme: An Inquiry-based Learning to Cultivate Innovation and Research Mindset,"‘Students as researchers’ is an active pedagogy emphasizing the process of student research and inquiry. When students practice inquiry, it helps them develop all the critical skills needed for the 21st century which include problem identification, problem-solving, critical thinking, team working, data analysis, scientific reasoning, decision making, etc. Similarly, a programme known as the Young Researcher Programme (YRP) has been implemented in the School of Engineering at Nanyang Polytechnic, Singapore since 2017 to nurture students’ innovative spirit and develop capabilities in conducting research. In the YRP, students are to form their own teams that consist of members who are from different years of study and engineering disciplines. The purpose is to train students to find ways to collaborate, learn and share knowledge and skillsets with a diverse group of members in the team. The team is then required to conduct independent research, integrate ideas from different resources, support their ideas with evidence, conceptualise and apply relevant principles in designing the experiments or products, implement them under staff supervision, and evaluate the validity and reliability of their conclusions. As the YRP is conducted beyond the formal curriculum hours, students are not bounded by the requirement of the curriculum and are free to work on research projects that are of interest to them. Students in the YRP are also given ample opportunities to attend training and seminars, as well as participate in industry visits. This paper describes how the YRP exposes students to a culture of inquiry-based learning starting from as early as their first year of study at the Polytechnic. This paper also discusses the effectiveness of the YRP in inculcating a research mindset among the students and the usefulness in tracking their individual progress in YRP until their final year of study in the polytechnic. Finally, this paper highlights the challenges faced and provides recommendations for future enhancement of the YRP.",Kum L.; Soon C.; Loh L.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International CDIO Conference,2019-01-01,Nanyang Polytechnic,Active Learning ;  collaborative learning ;  inquiry-based learning ;  Standards: 8 ;  Young Researcher Programme
Innovative engineering project from engineering design to implementation-base on CDIO model,"In the past, the higher education in Taiwan aimed to create elites in the field of engineering. However, the conventional subjects and curriculum taught were mainly focusing on the introduction and understanding of theories. So students who only accept professional theories, the technology developed is not necessarily the needs of the industry, hence affecting the competitiveness of the country. The importance of “Creative Education” was mentioned in many research papers around the world when discussing how to enhance national competitiveness. Feng Chia University is devoted to promote “The Project of Innovative Engineering”. By borrowing the experience of innovative education from Purdue University and combining it with the CDIO model, Feng Chia University created a systematic process for the project of innovative engineering. This allows students to discover and define problems, analyze and simulate actual situations, conceive and invent products, and in the end, achieve product evaluation and innovation development. This paper introduces the procedure of how Feng Chia University integrated the CDIO framework into innovative education, and how, they through curriculum development, encourages students to engage in active learning and gather learning experiences rather than passive note-taking. The results of the current two semesters have shown that by transforming industrial design into a project of innovative engineering really does enhance students’ motivation for active learning. The learning goal and process created based on Bloom’s taxonomy is set to start with “creativity”. Under this guideline, students are willing to learn the contents related to “analysis”, “assessment” and “application” more actively, leading to an outcome of the enhanced ability to “memorize” and “comprehend”. Moreover, by using the CDIO framework to create the project of innovative engineering, it allows teachers to overcome the time limitations which existed in the system before, and at the same time enhances the depth of learning for the students significantly.",Liang C.; Shin S.; Wang V.; Teng C.; Lee Y.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International CDIO Conference,2019-01-01,Feng Chia University;National Taiwan University of Sport,"Bloom’s taxonomy ;  Practical skills development ;  Project-based learning ;  Self-determination theory ;  Standards: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8"

ELECTRICAL COMMUNICATION BETWEEN “HORSERADISH PEROXIDASE” AND MODIFIED ELECTRODES WITH NANOMATERIALS: APPLICATION AS ENZYMATIC ELECTROCHEMICAL BIOSENSORS,"This chapter aims to cover the latest advancements and innovations in the field of enzymatic electrochemical sensors based on the electrical communication between “Horseradish Peroxidase” and the enzyme’s modified electrodes surfaces. The “Horseradish Peroxidase” is a glycoprotein that contains an iron porphyrin as an electroactive center that has been widely used as electrochemical biosensors due to its low cost and stable characteristics. Studies on the electrochemical behavior of a bioactive molecule as “Horseradish Peroxidase” have become one of the fastest growing fields, where interest has grown in biomedical engineering and biotechnology in the manufacture of more stable, responsive, accurate and voltammetric/amperometric biosensors. The application of this type of devices involves many fields: cancer diagnosis, water analysis, heavy metal ion detection, and toxicity detection. However, research on the electrochemical communication of redox enzyme immobilized on solid electrodes is one of the principal challenges for the development of electronic applications. This has opened a new route towards bioelectrochemical devices based on enzymes and metallic electrodes that demands more advanced and reliable tools. It includes an appropriate enzyme redox-electrode interface, where an appropriate “matrix” immobilization is essential to study and optimize the electrochemical properties of this kind of devices. This field presents a rapid growth in the design of this type of biosensors that have required the incorporation of nanomaterials. This document presents a review of the research that has been carried out in the development of nanomaterials for the fabrication of enzymes electrochemical sensors that have presented major efficiency for the immobilization and effective communication of “Horseradish Peroxidase” with the electrodic surface and its application for the precise detection of different important analytes (Peroxides, phenolic compounds and nitrides). In this review, the general voltammetric techniques are addressed and how these techniques are useful for the biosensitivity and detection of these devices, together with the important details and concepts around them, such as sensitivity and detection limits.

Regional Development and Technology,"Technology is the body of know-how (in both tacit and codified forms of knowledge) about the means and methods of producing goods and services. Technology involves science, engineering, and design-based knowledge but also includes developing new methods of organization and practice. Regional development involves complex economic, technical, and social changes and is associated with economic growth but also includes improvements related to wider administrative institutional, organizational, and political frameworks and operations. Technology, and more widely innovation, is a key element associated with this change and development process at a regional level. This change can, however, include economic decline as well as growth, as new products, processes, and methods challenge and force out older technologies and practices.",Howells J.,Book,"International Encyclopedia of Human Geography, Second Edition",2019-01-01,University of Kent,Clusters ;  Innovation ;  Knowledge transfer ;  Regional ;  Research and development (R&D) ;  Spillovers ;  Systems of innovation ;  Technology
Innovative Collaboration Formation: The National Academies Keck Futures Initiative,"Founded in 2003 as a 15-year undertaking with generous support from the W. M. Keck Foundation, the National Academies Keck Futures Initiative (NAKFI) occupied a unique space within the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and in the broader landscape of inter- and transdisciplinary research programs. It was one of a myriad of programs, workshops, models, and activities which aim to expand the boundaries about how we view, support, and conduct interdisciplinary science. The program provided collaborative opportunities to nearly 2000 professionals across a broad range of fields and made conceptual and methodological contributions to how team science is fostered and evaluated. This chapter will describe the key features of the NAKFI conference and seed grants program, how it evolved over time, and demonstrate how adaptation and evaluation contributed to the program’s development. It will also explore the strengths and limitations of this approach and address strategies that have been used to overcome challenges during the program’s 15-year duration.

Tool Support for Designing Innovative Sustainable Business Models,"Successful innovation is the key to generate novel business model ideas. Current real-world challenges such as the deterioration of the natural environment require practitioners and academics alike to identify new ways of acting and behaving. Living the ‘virtues of German engineering’ in information systems research, we aim at supporting business model innovation and solving imminent challenges by developing purposeful IT artifacts. In this article, we report on three ongoing research projects and emerging software prototypes that assist business model innovation. First, to foster creativity during the development of new business model ideas and to increase rigorousness in Design Thinking, we implemented a prototype that enables a structured, traceable, and collaborative documentation of Design Thinking projects and recommends task-specific creativity techniques. Second, to support the construction and the analysis of business models, we present the GBM Editor that especially focuses on the reflection of sustainability. Third, to detail the business model, we illustrate the Cooperation Manager that allow planning service networks by focusing on inter-organizational tasks and information exchanges. For demonstrating the applicability and the dependencies of these tools, we draw on an illustrative scenario of electric vehicle battery second use.",Knackstedt R.; Bräuer S.; Schoormann T.,Book,The Art of Structuring: Bridging the Gap between Information Systems Research and Practice,2019-01-01,Universität Hildesheim,Business model development ;  Electric vehicle battery second use ;  Software prototypes ;  ‘Gestaltungsorientierte Forschung’
An International View of Stem Education,"Science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and research are increasingly recognized globally as fundamental to national development and productivity, economic competitiveness and societal wellbeing. There has been a global turn to STEM that is clearly evident in government efforts worldwide to elaborate STEM policy governing school science and mathematics, and tertiary level education and research in the STEM disciplines. This shift is also reflected in emerging research priorities that are most frequently conceived in STEM terms, underpinned by commitments to internationalization and multidisciplinarity. This chapter explores STEM policies and programs from an international perspective extending from the Anglosphere, East Asia, Western Europe and Latin America to the Middle East. We identify discernible trends and parallels regarding government STEM policy and structural responses, school and tertiary level STEM education participation, comparative performance measured by international assessments such as PISA and TIMMS, STEM research and innovation, and issues concerning gender and under-represented groups. The chapter examines various programs and solutions including school-level curriculum and pedagogy reform to enhance science and mathematics participation and performance, teaching-related initiatives, and strategies at the tertiary-level to redress current systemic disparities.",Freeman B.; Marginson S.; Tytler R.,Book,STEM Education 2.0: Myths and Truths - What Has K-12 STEM Education Research Taught Us?,2019-01-01,University of Oxford;University of Melbourne;Deakin University,

COMPETING CONCERNS IN WELFARE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW,"Welfare technologies (WT) such as telecare and service robots are expected to improve and even radically transform service delivery in health-and eldercare. Yet despite political awareness and financial investments, many studies report promising inventions that fail to become implemented on a larger scale. Current research draws a fragmented and heterogeneous picture of this problem, with divergent implications for practice. In this article, I review and discuss the extant literature and identify eight competing concerns that are central to how WT can become implemented on a large scale. By highlighting and contrasting practical and theoretical positions in this emerging and interdisciplinary research topic, I contribute conceptually to the understanding of the competing concerns in WT innovation that managers and policy-makers must balance in order to support the critical transition from small-scale invention to large-scale implementation.",Aaen J.,Conference Proceeding,"10th Scandinavian Conference on Information Systems, SCIS 2019",2019-01-01,Aalborg University,Adoption ;  Assistive technology ;  Diffusion ;  Innovation ;  Literature review ;  Upscaling ;  Welfare technology

Splitting failure mode in textile reinforced concrete,"Textile reinforcement is a key innovation in the field of civil engineering. It consists of rovings made out of thousands of filaments. To improve bond performance these textiles are impregnated afterwards with either reactive resins (mainly epoxy resin) or aqueous dispersions (mainly styrene butadiene or styrene-acrylate copolymers). Experiments carried out at the Institute of Structural Engineering at TU Wien showed the high potential of structural elements reinforced with epoxy impregnated textile reinforcement. However a spalling of the concrete cover due to high bond stresses could be observed in most cases, subsequently leading to premature failure of the test specimens. Based on this observation further tests on the bond performance of textile reinforcement bonded in high performance concrete were carried out using a special bond performance test adapted for textile reinforcement in particular. The research described in this paper shows that the roving geometry and the production process of the textile reinforcement is responsible for high splitting forces orthogonal to the textile layer, resulting in a spalling of the concrete cover. For further developments in textile reinforced concrete it is very important to understand the bond behaviour of textile reinforcement. All findings within this research are small steps toward reaching this goal.",Preinstorfer P.; Kollegger J.,Conference Proceeding,fib Symposium,2019-01-01,Technische Universität Wien,Bond behaviour ;  Longitudinal cracking ;  Textile reinforcement

Bridging the Gap Towards Flying: Archaeopteryx as a Unique Evolutionary Tool to Inquiry-Based Learning,"A theoretically derived sixth-grade classroom module focusing on the evolution of birds contains the core of our study. Participants, assumed to be novices in evolutionary classroom issues when they completed matching hands-on experiments based on the inquiry-based vision, learned about the theoretical background and formulated explanations based on observations. Our age-appropriate inquiry-based hands-on and multimedia workstations focusing on the unique Archaeopteryx fossil contained a (replica) fossil with its extraordinary importance for better understanding evolution. Student-centred object-based activities including self-dependent learning opportunities were supported by the individual learning stations. The method applied was scientific inquiry which is assumed to allow students to derive empirically supported explanations. The structure originated in the 5 ‘E’ (engage, explore, explain, extent and evaluate), a key concept regarded as optimally supporting individual cognitive learning. The module integrated (a) arts in science with (b) authentic tools and aimed to further interesting in learning science. It intended to promote enthusiasm, to support successful learning in science and to cross-link interdisciplinary tools. A working booklet and various tools provided background information about, for instance, the bird flight and probable life of Archaeopteryx. Participation caused a substantial and sustained increase in individual knowledge scores after the lesson unit, i.e. signalling a sustained learning success. As no gender effect appeared, the module apparently affects female and male students equally. Subsequent conclusions for everyday teaching in school are discussed and recommendations for teaching derived.",Buck A.; Sotiriou S.; Bogner F.,Book,Evolution Education Re-considered: Understanding What Works,2019-01-01,Universität Bayreuth;R and D,Archaeopteryx ;  Arts in STEM education (STEAM) ;  Authentic tools ;  Evolution of birds ;  Hands-on ;  Inquiry-based learning ;  Knowledge acquisition ;  Multimedia ;  Responsible research and innovation (RRI) ;  Science technology engineering math education (STEM)
Gender Equity Instrumentalism and (Re)Building the Nation Through Innovation: Critical Reflections on Women in STEM Policy in Australia,"In this chapter, a critical lens is applied to recent research and innovation policy in Australia on the issue of women in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). It is argued that the innovation agenda driven by successive Australian federal governments over the last decade (2007–2017) has brought a renewed focus on women in STEM. This focus, while welcome, has been marked by a reframing of the issue from within a social justice and equity paradigm to a more instrumentalist innovation and knowledge economy labor force framework. Some implications of what we call the gender equity instrumentalism at work in policy discourse in Australia and elsewhere are then explored. Cautionary notes are drawn from feminist scholarship in the field of economic development and gender studies.",Cuthbert D.; Sidelil L.,Book Series,International and Development Education,2019-01-01,RMIT University,
Creativity Development and Educational Expenditures: An Exploratory Study,"The creative idea’s source lies in the Ancient Greece where Aristotle considered creativity as something that resulted “when one is bereft of his senses.” Creativity entails generating and recognizing ideas; solving problems; viewing things from different perspectives and in different ways; changing or transforming an existing domain into a new one, in an innovative and unique way; and associating different fields of knowledge. Creativity development is an important consideration for many disciplines such as education, technology, engineering, cognitive science, business studies, and economics. The main goal of creativity is developing through exploration, decision-making, and expression. In an era defined by technological innovations and marked by financial crisis, developing the creative and innovative potential of students reflects the need of new educational methods. This necessity was recently reported to the European Commission’s project entitled “Modernization on Education.” The current research explores the different sources of funding (governmental or households), reports the spending per country on education, and, finally, emphasizes the importance OECD countries assign to education. This research aims at depicting the linkage between state budget spending on education and creativity development. It is purported that increases in expenditures on education may help foster economic growth, enhance productivity, contribute to people’s personal and social development, and help reduce social inequalities. Educational expenditures include spending on universities, schools, and other private and public institutions.",Papoutsi F.,Conference Proceeding,Springer Proceedings in Business and Economics,2019-01-01,National and Kapodistrian University of Athens,Creativity development ;  Creativity in education ;  Educational expenditures ;  Modernization of education
Structure and Surface Reactivity Mediated Enzymatic Performances of Clay-Based Nanobiocatalyst,"The nanobiocatalyst is an emerging innovation that synergistically integrates advanced nanotechnology with biotechnology for improving enzyme activity, stability, capability and engineering performances. Enzymes and clay minerals are two important essential substances in the earth. As the important nanostructured minerals, clay minerals have played an important role in enzyme-related biochemical processes such as the origin and evolution of life, soil ecological environment, pollution remediation and element geochemical cycling, and even some clay minerals have intrinsic enzymatic activities. Based on the study of clay minerals-based enzyme-like activities and enzymatic catalysis in confined environment by clay minerals, lipase and 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) functionalized montmorillonite (Mt) were selected to biomimetic construct lipase-Mt nanobiocatalyst. Experimental results indicated that lipase-Mt activity was 40.65 U/mg, which was nearly 4-fold higher than that of free lipase under optimal conditions. The kinetic parameters of Km and Vmax for lipase-Mt were 3.406 mM and 312.5 mM/L min, respectively, indicating a higher affinity of the immobilized lipase in nanobiocatalyst towards the substrate compared with free lipase. The present study has provided a promising way for screening, optimizing and rational design of efficient nanomineral-based enzymatic nanobiocatalyst.

Case Studies of Product Life Cycle Environmental Impacts for Teaching Engineering Ethics,"Given the rapid rate of technological innovation and a desire to be proactive in addressing potential ethical challenges that arise in contexts of innovation, engineers must learn to engage in value-sensitive design - design that is responsive to a broad range of values that are implicated in the research, development, and application of technologies. One widely-used tool is Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Physical products, as with organisms, have a life cycle, starting with extraction of raw materials, and including refining, transport, manufacturing, use, and finally end-of-life treatment and disposal. LCA is a quantitative modeling framework that can estimate emissions that occur throughout a product’s life cycle, as well as any harmful effects that these emissions have on the environment and/or public health. Importantly, LCA tools allow engineers to evaluate multiple types of environmental and health impacts simultaneously and are not limited to a single endpoint or score. However, LCA is only useful to the extent that its models accurately include the full range of values implicated in the use of a technology, and to the extent that stakeholders, from designers to decisionmakers, understand and are able to communicate these values and how they are assigned. Effective LCA requires good ethical training to understand these values.",Eckelman M.; Basl J.; Bosso C.; Isaacs J.; Eggleson K.,Book,Next-Generation Ethics: Engineering a Better Society,2019-01-01,Indiana University School of Medicine-South Bend;Northeastern University,
"BRAIN STUDANTS: GAMES AND VIRTUAL AND MIXED REALITY AS AN ACTIVE METHODOLOGY IN SCIENCE TEACHING FOR STUDENTS OF THE 6th YEAR OF FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION IN ARAGUATINS, TO","This article deals with the influences of Virtual Realities (VR) and Mixed Techniques (MR) technological practices in the educational process of 6th grade students and their interdisciplinarity. Seeking to clarify the performance of digital games, this work aims to use games as a model to create a differentiated practice focused on the improvement of student learning. Using a quantitative and exploratory research, an evaluation of knowledge was applied to the students, verified the lowest index of knowledge and understanding of what was worked in class previously, set up a workshop to train the technological tools, finalizing with Games Tournament. Comparing the traditional evaluative method with the technological evaluation, there was an incomparable level of curiosity, creativity and interest. In the technological evaluation, the students presented mastery of the content, with a 35.3% greater number of correct answers when compared to the traditional evaluation model. This research contrasts the negative view about the use of games and the dichotomy that digital devices do not contribute as a teaching tool; raising their potential development in cognitive skills during learning. Thus, the primordiality of the preparation of the educators for the use of these apparatuses, also its introduction the other available tools. For this, it is necessary that there be institutional, social and mainly governmental support with investments in structure and qualification of the same so that it is possible to enjoy a quality education with students engaged and active in the social environment to which they belong.",Miranda M.; Gonçalves M.,Journal,International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning,2019-01-01,IFTO,Education.

FINANCING AND LEVERAGING PUBLIC/PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS: THE HURDLE-LOWERING AUCTION,"The purpose of this article is to propose a mechanism – the hurdle-lowering auction – for leveraging the public funds invested in public/private partnerships to promote technology. The article addresses financial engineering – the optimal amount and design of public funding of privately performed investments in technology and innovation carried out by public/private partnerships. Public/private partnerships are joint research ventures combining public and private resources to invest in the research and development of technology and innovations. Thus, financial engineering concerns the design of mechanisms for public funding of public/private partnerships that generate the maximum leverage of the public funds on the private investment and performance. By maximum leverage of public funding, is meant maximum effectiveness of the funds in ensuring the use of the least amount of public funds to get the desired results and ensuring the necessary incentives to get those results given the appropriate amount of public funding.",Scott J.,Book,The Social Value of New Technology,2019-01-01,Faculty of Arts and Sciences,

Standardized representation of typological data as common input for urban performance simulation,"In the context of energetic district planning, energy simulations have steadily gained in importance through improvements and innovations in the corresponding IT-supported tools. Often, however, the continuous use of these tools up to now is hindered by insufficient data availability. Although there are technical approaches to how missing data can be supplemented across the board with the help of literature-based data that is related to the stock by the means of local typologies, these are mostly individual approaches of single experts. In order to create a uniform basis for this type of information requirements, an extension of the established object model CityGML was developed within the framework of the research project EnEff:Stadt-ModelSIM. With the concept prepared as application domain extension (ADE), typological data can be described in the urban models and make it possible to support town planning throughout, i.e. accompanying the process.",Ebertshäusen S.; van Bothi P.,Conference Proceeding,Building Simulation Conference Proceedings,2019-01-01,Karlsruher Institut für Technologie,
Modelling and control of a continuous vibrated fluidized bed dryer in pharmaceutical production,"Pharmaceutical tablets are still largely produced using batch processes, at which the production line is divided into successive sub-processes [1]. In order to reduce product waste and production time and to increase the flexibility of tablet production, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), among others, promotes research and innovations in the field of continuous production for the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals. The QbCon®1 unit developed by L.B. Bohle Maschinen +Verfahren GmbH is one of the research field innovations [2]. The plant combines all three necessary process steps of continuous raw material dosing (premix of excipients and active ingredients), twin-screw wet granulation and fluid bed drying to enable continuous wet granulation and drying of the tableting mixture. In this article, the continuous fluid bed dryer is firstly presented. Subsequently, a continuum based model is developed for the drying process. The aim is to develop a model that can be used for model-based product quality control. From a control engineering point of view, this is a multi-variable problem, since different process variables (e.g. drying air temperature, air mass flow, conveying speed of the granules) have an influence on the drying process. The control of the Process Variables (PVs) is carried out with the aid of standard industrial PID controllers. The tuning and validation of PVs controllers is based on empirical investigations or using developed actuation models. Finally, a concept for the control of one of the process main critical quality attributes (CQAs), namely the tablet mixture moisture content, is presented with the aid of a model based controller approach. The model constructed for the drying process has shown a good match to the real process with a maximum of 1.18% prediction standard deviation from the experimentally measured mean moisture content. Moreover, the model based controller approach feasibility is demonstrated using a closed loop simulation of an implemented Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC).",Elkhashap A.; Abel D.; Meier R.,Book Series,VDI Berichte,2019-01-01,Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen;L.B.

Topology optimization in rotorcraft applications,"To introduce a new design nowadays the engineer has to show, that it provides a significant leap in performance improvement, not only a minor step. This is the reason why new technologies are implemented as those currently used are close to the border of optimization. Among other technologies, which will certainly be widely used in future aerospace, is 3D printing. As parts are expected to be lighter and maintain the same structural strength, the best solution to produce complicated shapes is to print it out. This allows to produce complicated shapes, that can have closed, empty spaces, what provides significant mass reduction. The paper will concentrate on the manner of constructing parts ready for printing with optimization process implemented. A brief description of topology optimization helps to understand the data connections between design and manufacturing.

Teaching creativity in structural design - Approaches and challenges in Germany,"With around 1.94 million employees and a turnover of approximately € 237 billion, the construction industry is a significant economic sector in the German economy. The number of persons working in this sector is about twice as large as in mechanical engineering, and the turnover of both sectors is almost the same. While the German Research Foundation DFG approved € 355.9 million funding for “Mechanical Engineering and Production Technology” in the years 2014 to 2016, the sector of “Building and Architecture” only received commitments of € 91.3 million, what is only 1.1% of the total commitments of the DFG. By contrast, the percentage of gross domestic product used in Germany for construction investment is 9.9%, which is about 10 times higher than the percentage of research funding for this economically important sector. These figures indicate a comparatively low level of research, development and innovation in the construction industry. Looking at the teaching of structural design, Werner Sobek notes that the training of civil engineers, especially in structural engineering, still is almost exclusively concerned with the analysis of given structures - not with creativity or innovation. Regarding this background on the one hand and Frei Otto's extraordinary professional career on the other hand, necessity and possibilities of integrating creativity in the teaching of civil engineering are examined.",Moeller E.; Nungesser H.,Conference Proceeding,"IASS Symposium 2019 - 60th Anniversary Symposium of the International Association for Shell and Spatial Structures; Structural Membranes 2019 - 9th International Conference on Textile Composites and Inflatable Structures, FORM and FORCE",2019-01-01,Hochschule Karlsruhe - Technik und Wirtschaft,Creativity ;  Design research ;  Innovation ;  Inspiration ;  Invention ;  Physical modeling ;  Research and development ;  Structural design ;  Teaching
Internet of Things and big data recommender systems to support Smart Grid,"Since its appearance, the Internet of Things (IoT) has completely revolutionized almost all aspects of our lives. Among present and potential numerous and diverse applications of IoT, its utilization in the energy sector is of particular interest. The IoT inclusion in the power industry and Smart Grid (SG) evolution opens a whole world of high-potential opportunities to optimize the grid operation. The realization of SGs utilizing smart metering technology or advanced metering infrastructure with bidirectional IoT-based communication between demand and utility could improve existing energy balancing procedures. Keeping energy consumption and supply in balance with minimal operating costs and optimal grid conditions is not an easy task, especially in presence of renewable energy sources. As the IoT is established on the utilization of a large number of smart things/devices that generate a prodigious amount of data on a daily basis, successfully managing big data represents a key issue. In order to obtain valuable insights and knowledge from data gathered, the appliance of big data analytics is demanded. Hence, effective analysis and utilization of a massive amount of diversity of data that arrive at high speed and can be of uncertain provenance are mandatory in the process of obtaining valuable insights and enable the creation of knowledge-based recommender systems. Big data analytics applied to data gathered from smart meters could be used to make valuable recommendations regarding consumption prediction, demand response and management programs, voltage and frequency control, state estimation, and power quality. The overall operation of SG could be certainly optimized in various aspects by using large-scale near real-time measurements. The general aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of ongoing scientific research, recent technological innovations and breakthroughs, and big data analytics role in making recommendation systems that will facilitate the development and evolution of future global energy systems.",Maksimović M.; Forcan M.,Book,Big Data Recommender Systems: Application Paradigms,2019-01-01,University of East Sarajevo,Big Data ;  Big Data analytics ;  Big Data recommender systems ;  Data handling techniques ;  Energy consumption ;  Energy supply ;  Information networks ;  Internet of Things ;  Internet of Things ;  IoT ;  Power and energy measurement ;  Power engineering computing ;  Power engineering computing ;  Power systems ;  Recommender systems ;  Search engines ;  Smart Grid ;  Smart meters ;  Smart meters ;  Smart power grids ;  Ubiquitous and pervasive computing
Identifying Value in the Engineering Enterprise,"The investigation presented in this chapter was originally inspired by the authors’ observations of engineers in Australia, India, Pakistan, and Portugal that suggested the value aspect of their work was rarely addressed. This is somewhat surprising given that value creation lies at the core of any business and nearly all of the engineers observed were working for business enterprises. This initial observation led us to examine what turned out to be relatively sparse literature relating to engineering value, how the value of engineering work is perceived within the context of entrepreneurship and innovation research and how students are introduced to this in engineering education programs and entrepreneurship courses. We were led to conclude that the concept of value creation makes only a tenuous and indistinct appearance at the far periphery of engineering discourse. Given the critical importance of business investment for almost all engineering enterprises, it is surprising that the research literature is almost silent on this issue. In the study we identify ways that engineers create and protect value that are not usually mentioned in the innovation-centred approach typical of entrepreneurship research and education emanating from Schumpeter’s early twentieth century ideas that still shape business and economics today. We hypothesize that this lack of awareness of value creation by engineers may be associated with low success rates of major engineering capital expansion projects such as process plants, infrastructure construction, and defence equipment acquisitions. Furthermore, it could help to explain some of the everyday frustrations encountered by engineers, employers and investors in engineering enterprises and low rates of productivity improvement in developing countries.",Trevelyan J.; Williams B.,Book Series,Philosophy of Engineering and Technology,2019-01-01,The University of Western Australia;Instituto Superior Técnico,Economics ;  Engineering education ;  Engineering philosophy ;  Engineering practice ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Value creation
Industry and the Development of a New System of Higher Technological Education in the UK 1955–1965: A Shared Responsibility?,"There is a continuing conflict between education and industry that begins with the different perceptions that educators and industrialists have of the purposes of tertiary education through to university study. For example at the present time there is a pressure from industry on the higher education sector to prepare new graduates immediately for work. In so doing industry places the responsibility for education and training on the institutions of higher education and through their fees on the students for their education and training. The purpose of this chapter is to examine the extent to which responsibility was shared between the colleges and industry when England and Wales had a national system of higher technological education and training based on the sandwich principle in the 1950s and 1960s, and to show that industrialists working with educationalists are capable of producing innovatory curricula. Harold Silver the Historian of the Council for National Academic Awards 1964–1989 (A Higher Education (1990) London, Falmer) reports that of the thesis and dissertation literature for the earlier period, that is the period too which this chapter relates there were only two that were relevant, one of which was the authors (p 279). Such research as there was is documented in Heywood, J. and R. Ann Abel (1964) Technical Education and Training in the United Kingdom. Research in Progress 1962–1964. Slough. The National Foundation for Educational Research). If engineering education is to progress practitioners in both academia and industry will require an understanding of the substantial knowledge base that has been developed, which implies some kind of training. Only in this way will they learn to share responsibility at the operational and executive levels of curriculum delivery and planning.",Heywood J.,Book Series,Philosophy of Engineering and Technology,2019-01-01,Trinity College Dublin,Academia ;  Accreditation ;  Assessment ;  Competence ;  Curriculum innovation ;  Industrial training ;  Industry ;  NCTA ;  Percy committee ;  Policy ;  Problem/project based learning ;  Responsibility ;  Sandwich (cooperative) courses ;  Technological education
Impacts of Nanotechnology Adoption on Sustainable Construction,"The architectural, engineering and construction industry plays a significant role in the development of any country but, the industry have been experiencing a number of challenges relating to safety, environmental issues and general performance especially as a result of continuous adoption of traditional and conventional construction materials. In a view to minimize these challenges and achieve sustainable development, this study examines the effects of the adoption of nanotechnology principle to traditional construction materials. A review of existing literature materials on nanotechnology, sustainable construction and construction materials results in identification of 12 major impacts of nanotechnology on construction materials. In designing the questionnaire for the study, these factors were subsequently adopted and the research instruments were distributed to construction professionals, that is, quantity surveyors, engineers, construction managers, project managers and architects, in private and public establishments in Gauteng region of South Africa. The adoption of nanotechnology will not only help in reducing waste and provide new means of innovation but will also aid reforming of existing environmental remediation techniques. However, the adoption may also result in adverse effects on environment and human health if not properly managed by experts and concerned regulatory agencies. This indicates that as beneficial as the concept of nanotechnology may be to the performance of architectural, engineering and construction projects, care should be taken by contractors or developers, construction professionals and regulatory agencies, to understand and apply the principle in accordance to standards and regulations to avoid any potential negative results.",Oke A.; Aigbavboa C.; Semenya K.,Book Series,Sustainable Civil Infrastructures,2019-01-01,University of Johannesburg,Construction materials ;  Nanotechnology ;  Project success ;  Sustainable construction ;  Sustainable development
The Entrepreneurial Education in the Republic of kazakhstan: from Theory to Concept,"This article provides information about the current situation of entrepreneurial education in Kazakhstan.

Using smart technology in sustainable entrepreneurship in Island tourism: A preliminary research,"Smart technology plays a crucial role in innovation, and innovation in turn is essential for entrepreneurship. This study aims to understand how smart technology can play a part in sustainable entrepreneurship, in the context of tourism on a small island. In particular, this study will look at smart tourism, and the possibilities for sustainable tourism entrepreneurship on the small Mediterranean island of Cyprus. While only a developing region, a de-facto state, can technology be developed that will allow North Cyprus to develop as an area of smart tourism? This paper will higlight the technology needed, as well as the new business models this will entail. The research methodology begins with a qualitative survey. in the form of unstructured interviews with a small number of entrepreneurs in the region, with the aim of undestanding the entreprenuers’ perceptions of smart technology, and whether they see a role for it in the future of their business, and the region. It is planned to used mixed methods, and to follow up the themes and questions raised by the interviews, with a quantiative survey to be administered to around 300 entreprenuers around the island. A quantitative survey will also bring forth the amount of understanding of smart technology in the region, as well as the role of sustainable entrepreneurship and smart technology. The initial results from the interviews reveal that entrepreneurs are not familiar with the term smart tourism, yet they can see some benefits of the adoption of smart tourism in Cyprus. The evaluation of the interviews indicate that entrepreneurs, while unsure about the availability of smart technology, were keen to learn more about the technology, and possibly to innovate and take advantage of this new technology. Entrepreneurs were also interested in how smart tourism could increase knowledge on sustainable tourism, and therefore sustainable entrepreneurship in the region.",Howells K.; Ertugan A.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Intellectual Capital, Knowledge Management and Organisational Learning, ICICKM",2019-01-01,Yakın Doğu Üniversitesi,Entrepreneurship ;  Internet of Things ;  North Cyprus ;  Smart technology ;  Smart tourism ;  Sustainable tourism
Project based learning and publishing refereed papers through course projects,"Publishing quality papers in both International conferences and Journals is one of the great challenges faced by Engineering Institutions. To publish quality papers with scopus index based on the experience of Course Projects which are explored through Project Based Learning. This was considered in third semester MTech. Since the time is too short and is only 12 weeks, we have come up with many ideas and used new innovative process to publish papers in International Conference with Scopus Index. The main purpose is to train the MTech students to publish quality papers in International Conferences / Journals with scopus index through course projects. To publish quality papers with scopus index, based on the experience of course projects require lot of in-depth knowledge, choosing tools and making use of the latest technology. Imparting this knowledge is challenging and is achieved through project based learning. Choosing the latest area was the first challenge. Internet of Things (IoT) was a course in third semester MTech and was selected as the theme for Course Projects and it was compulsory. The students were given a chance to choose a project in the area of their interest under IoT. After selecting a project, optimal and feasible solution has to be selected with innovation. The students as a team have to learn and give a solution to the problem and it should be such that the work carried out should be able to publish the paper in an International Conference / Journals. There were nineteen students in the class and five teams were made out of nineteen students. The target of each team is to publish one scopus indexed paper in International Conference / Journal. All the five teams are able to achieve the goal set and is discussed in the results below. All the five teams formed are able to submit the papers to IEEE International Conference on Advances in Information Technology 2019 (ICAIT2019) and all the papers have been accepted and presented, three will be published in IEEE Explore and two will be published in UGC Referred INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN ELECTRONICS AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING (IJRECE) and all are scopus indexed. It has been a practice to teach a course with emphasis on theory. In this approach a course project was insisted by selecting a problem and giving an IoT solution to the problem. The five teams formed are able to publish five scopus indexed papers one per team and are able to get in-depth knowledge about the course taught. Without this kind of approach, the students would not have published such papers and would not have got in-depth knowledge.",Baligar V.,Journal,Journal of Engineering Education Transformations,2019-01-01,K.

Innovation and convergence/divergence: searching the technology landscape,"Technology convergence – the combination of two or more technologies in a single device or product – has historically led to radical social, economic, and industrial change. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the coming transformation of aviation through emerging technologies such as electric propulsion, autonomous systems, machine learning, and advanced computing. To better understand the implications of technology convergence relevant to aviation, NASA sponsored a study to (1) develop and demonstrate a repeatable methodology to identify areas of potential technology convergence impacting the future of aviation, and (2) explore the potential impact of converging technologies on selected future aeronautical concepts. The methodology applied cluster analysis and text mining techniques to identify candidate technologies, including those outside of traditional aviation sources, and their potential for application in four areas. The results were reviewed by subject matter experts and in structured workshops to rank technologies of interest and provide recommendations relevant to NASA research plans. The four areas were covered in successive cycles addressing on-demand mobility, control of airflow to reduce air vehicle noise, advanced concepts for vertical takeoff and landing propulsion, and advanced technologies for future air traffic management. The study demonstrated that searching for technologies with potential for convergence is an iterative process – each search leads to deeper searches, different areas to be explored, or new questions. Quid proved to be a robust tool for analyzing the global technology landscape. The results revealed that, like any tool, the user has to know its capabilities and limitations: use cases and careful formulation of keywords were critical to obtaining the desired results, and search results must be combined with human knowledge and intuition for best results.",Pinon Fischer O.; Wang J.; Briceno S.; Price G.; Waszak M.; Mavris D.,Conference Proceeding,AIAA Aviation 2019 Forum,2019-01-01,"Crown Consulting, Inc.;Georgia Institute of Technology;NASA Langley Research Center;Quid Inc.",
Making it through the lunar night using chemicals: Internal combustion engine solar independent propulsion,"The very idea that internal combustion engines (ICEs) could play a role in outer space exploration may seem absurd. Nonetheless, United Launch Alliance (ULA) recently developed a 6-cylinder ICE to be used in their Centaur 3rd Stage. Its function is 3-fold: (1) rotary power will drive an electrical generator; (2) “waste” heat will be used to pressurize the liquid hydrogen (LH2) and liquid oxygen tanks (LO2); (3) the exhaust will be vented out a rocket nozzle to provide settling of the LH2/LO2 tanks. The total efficiency of the system is expected to approach 100%. The mass savings is expected to be on the order of 1 tonne. Another application of chemically powered ICEs in outer space could be serving as range extenders for lunar polar exploration rovers designed to operate in permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) of the Moon, or during the 2-week long night in illuminated regions. Exploring PSRs represents a tremendous engineering challenge. Permanently shaded Whipple Crater—notable because it is adjacent to a large plateau of quasi-permanent illumination suitable for a crewed outpost—has 30° slopes. Since current rover designs can safely navigate slopes less than 15° to 20°, a Resource Prospector Mission (RPM) design where a solar powered rover makes short sorties into the PSR only to climb out to recharge its batteries is not practicable. To explore Whipple Crater, the rover would have to land within the interior of the crater. Assuming this could be done, any solar panels would be useless. Therefore, a prospecting rover would be required to carry with it all energy required for the mission. To explore this possibility, we undertook preliminary engineering calculations based on the clean-sheet SonicFlow™ (SF) 2-stroke engine prototyped by Technology Elevated LLC. The engine incorporates two main innovations: (1) it uses the Kadenacy effect—reverberating sound waves—to pump the fuel-air mixture and remove exhaust gases on both the outlet and the inlet of the combustion chamber; and (2) the SF design incorporates a specifically designed centrifugal impeller, contained within the crankcase, that functions as a supercharger and isolates the fuel-air mixture from the lubricating oil. Consequently, the SF, like large diesel 2-stroke engines used in railroad locomotives, does not burn oil, yet the SF retains the simplicity of the traditional 2-stroke small engine. There are no valve trains, camshafts, or pumps. Under atmospheric conditions, the prototype SF achieved volumetric efficiencies measured at 120%. Measured thermal efficiency is 40%--unprecedented for such a small engine, and a best in class specific power of 2.1 kW/kg. Our model assumed an RPM sized rover of 100 kg with a 30 kg mass budget for an ICE-electrical hybrid power plant, and an average 200 W power. Assuming a 5 kg margin, after accounting for tankage, 10% boiloff of LH2, ~19 kg of LH2/LO2 could potentially power the rover for about 5.8 days; methane, with lower boiloff rates, could last close to 5 days, compared to a lithium battery-only design of only 2.6 days. A fuel cell (FC) system could have a somewhat higher thermal efficiency (~50%), but a much lower specific power. Consequently, given the strict mass constraints we assume, an FC system might be expected to produce a marginally better loiter time of 6.1 days. Considering the overall trade space, however, we believe an SF-ICE system could prove to be the superior choice due to better simplicity, reliability, cost, and ability to provide direct rotary power to the rover subsystems. The SF-ICE is also extremely fuel flexible and tolerant of fuel impurities. This capability could potentially allow refueling from the residual propellants left on the landing module, thus radically extending total loiter time.",Dyess W.; Platts W.,Conference Proceeding,"AIAA Propulsion and Energy Forum and Exposition, 2019",2019-01-01,Technology Elevated LLC;Technology Elevated LLC,
Future prospects and challenges,"A number of key innovations are enabling more sophisticated mechanobiological studies to be performed. However, rather than a single technique or method making the greatest impact on the field, it is the combination of these approaches that is facilitating the greatest progress. Successful mechanobiological studies rely on the integration of mechanical device design, imaging, computational modeling, and molecular biology. Although the concept of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research often sounds cliche, the convergence of mathematics, computer science, engineering, and biology in the field of mechanobiology has been, and will continue to be, a more driver of progress.",Niebur G.,Book,Mechanobiology: From Molecular Sensing to Disease,2019-01-01,College of Engineering,Future trends ;  Mechanobiology
Towards ontology-based design science research for knowledge accumulation and evolution,"The potential of design science research (DSR) to contribute to real-world problem solving and innovation has been considered as an opportunity for IS researchers to demonstrate the relevance and significance of DSR paradigm. While most DSR studies have been informed single design and development projects, future research needs to consider knowledge sharing and accumulation across multiple projects. This paper argues for combining the forces of design science research and ontology studies to foster knowledge creation and evolution. We propose a new approach to DSR by adopting ontology engineering as a knowledge sharing mechanism in which researchers assemble knowledge parts throughout the study. We develop a framework for understanding, conducting and evaluating ontology-based design science research, and then present the roadmap and guidelines for its conduct and evaluation. This paper concludes with a call for more collaborative efforts in design studies in IS research.",Nguyen A.; Gardner L.; Sheridan D.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,2019-01-01,The University of Auckland,
Construction safety on scaffolding: Building information modeling (bim) and safety management-A systematic review,"The construction industry is one of the most hazardous industries, with a high number of working injuries and fatalities. A special issue for occupational accidents in the construction industry is the use of scaffolds, which is usually attributed to falls from height. Research and practice have demonstrated that decisions made upstream from the construction site can influence construction worker safety. Therefore, it is crucial to assess the risk levels for different construction stages on scaffolding, with various work trades, aiming to prevent the occurrence of fall accidents. The use of new techniques and methodologies, such as Building Information Modeling (BIM), is of major importance. The growing implementation of BIM in Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) is changing the way safety can be approached. This study reviews the existing literature about BIM and construction safety on scaffolding, to explore useful findings and detect knowledge gaps for future research. Despite the enormous evolution of research and technological innovations based on BIM for construction safety, there is still a flagrant lack of knowledge and solutions for identifying hazards related to construction on scaffolding.",Rebelo M.; Silveira F.; Czarnocka E.; Czarnocki K.,Journal,U.Porto Journal of Engineering,2019-01-01,Politechnika Lubelska;Universidade do Porto,BIM ;  Building information modeling ;  Construction ;  Safety ;  Scaffold ;  Scaffolding

A marketing perspective on innovation,"This section presents an overview of the marketing perspective on innovation. From a marketing perspective, the role of innovation in an organization is to create a steady stream of new products and services that meets the needs of customers. The role of marketing is to carry the voice of the customer into the organization, in order to infuse decisions with this customer-centric perspective. The marketing discipline offers a number of different lenses through which innovation is studied, including a customer lens (e.g., factors that affect customers' decisions to adopt innovation and different categories of adopters; the rate and trajectory of adoption and diffusion of innovations; various research protocols and tools to study customer needs and perceptions of innovation; and the intersection of innovation and consumption from a cultural perspective); a company lens (e.g., the new product development process, product launch strategies, the interactions between marketing personnel and engineering/R&D personnel in the innovation process, marketing strategy including first-mover advantages, the role of organizational culture and market orientation in innovation and innovation performance, and how various types of innovations require different market strategies); an inter-firm relationship lens (including the role of suppliers, alliance/partners, channel retailers and distributors, and innovation ecosystem partners); and the lens of the broader market environment (such as government labs, industry consortia, etc.). In addition, this section identifies future opportunity areas where marketing can offer its distinctive perspective on innovation, including, for example, the role of social influencers in adoption of innovation; data-driven innovation; new types of innovation (reverse innovation, sustainable innovation, social innovation, and business model innovation); platform innovations/ innovation ecosystems; and biomimicry.",Mohr J.,Journal,Foundations and Trends in Entrepreneurship,2019-01-01,University of Montana,Biomimicry ;  Customer-driven innovation ;  Data-driven innovation ;  Innovation ;  Innovation ecosystems ;  Innovation performance ;  Marketing ;  Platform innovations ;  Sustainable innovations
From lab to internship and back again: Learning autonomous systems through creating a research and development ecosystem,"As research and development (R&D) in autonomous systems progresses further, more interdisciplinary knowledge is needed from domains as diverse as artificial intelligence (AI), bi-ology, psychology, modeling and simulation (M&S), and robotics. Such R&D efforts are necessarily interdisciplinary in nature and require technical as well as further soft skills of teamwork, communication and integration. In this paper, we introduce a 14 week, summer long internship for developing these skills in undergraduate science and engineering interns through R&D. The internship was designed to be modular and divided into three parts: training, innovation, and application/integration. The end result of the internship was 1) the development of an M&S ecosystem for autonomy concepts, 2) development and robotics testing of reasoning methods through both Bayesian methods and cognitive models of the basal ganglia, and 3) a process for future internships within the modular construct. Through collaboration with full-time professional staff, who actively learned with the interns, this internship incorporates a feedback loop to educate and per-form fundamental R&D. Future iterations of this internship can leverage the M&S ecosystem and adapt the modular internship framework to focus on different innovations, learning paradigms, and/or applications.",Bihl T.; Jenkins T.; Cox C.; DeMange A.; Hill K.; Zelnio E.,Conference Proceeding,"33rd AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AAAI 2019, 31st Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence Conference, IAAI 2019 and the 9th AAAI Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence, EAAI 2019",2019-01-01,Air Force Research Laboratory;Key W Corporation,
Revisiting Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance Through Blockchain Technologies,"The connection between Byzantine fault tolerance and cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, may not be apparent immediately. Byzantine fault tolerance is intimately linked to engineering and design challenges of developing long-running and safety-critical technical systems. Its origins can be traced back to the question of howto dealwith faulty sensors in distributed systems and the fundamental insight that majority voting schemes may be insufficient to guarantee correctness if arbitrary, or so-called Byzantine failures, can occur. However, achieving resilience against Byzantine failures has its price, both in terms of the redundancy required within a system and the incurred communication overhead. Together with the complexity of correctly implementing Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocols, it may help to explain why BFT systems have not yet been widely deployed in practice, even though practical designs exist for almost 20 years. On the other hand, asking anyone about Bitcoin or blockchain 10 years ago would have only raised quizzical looks. Since then, the ecosphere surrounding blockchain technologies has grown from the pseudonymously published proposal for a peer-to-peer electronic cash system into a multi-billion-dollar industry. At the heart of this success story lies not only the technical innovations presented by Bitcoin but a colorful and diverse community that has succeeded in bridging gaps and bringing together various disciplines from academia and industry alike. Bitcoin reinvigorated interest in the topic of BFT as it was arguably the first system that achieved a practical form of Byzantine fault tolerance with a large and changing number of participants. Research into the fundamental principles and mechanisms behind the underlying blockchain technology of Bitcoin has since helped advance the field and state of the art regarding BFT protocols. This chapter will outline how these modern blockchain technologies relate to the field of Byzantine fault tolerance and outline advantages and disadvantages in their design decisions and fundamental assumptions. Thereby, we highlight that Byzantine fault tolerance should be considered a practical and fundamental building block for modern long-running and safety critical systems and that the principles, mechanisms, and blockchain technologies themselves could help improve the security and quality of such systems.",Stifter N.; Judmayer A.; Weippl E.,Book,Security and Quality in Cyber-Physical Systems Engineering,2019-01-01,Technische Universität Wien;SBA Research,Bitcoin ;  Blockchain ;  Byzantine fault tolerance ;  Distributed ledger technologies ;  Distributed systems
Artificial intelligence engineering for postsecondary education digital transformation,"We present conceptual foundations for artificial intelligence, expert systems, and knowledge engineering and management and discuss high quality in education. Following, we discuss the basics of our vision and prospective about higher education (HE): the battle for the future with digital transformation (DT). Next, we present our central Chapter 4 on DT: our dual model of knowledge and data, as befits a HE institution. Below, we present a succinct outline of our architectural model. The pillars of the architecture are funding, research, entrepreneurship and social projection (Chapter 8); recognizing from the start that knowledge has its ethos in the university; these pillars correspond to: • Productive ecosystem of the DT • DT that enhances knowledge and innovation in the universities for the habilitation of the digital capabilities • A new economy that requires the U transformation as social projection. • New DT human talent required by the new knowledge and intelligence industry. The student hyper-personalization by competences and skills is required.

The DT views, namely: 1- The DT Ecosystem. 2- The structural vision or the pillars of the DT mentioned. 3- The DT strategic map, showing scenarios, actors and vision-mission. 4- The architectural components for DT: 8 architectures were developed and implemented, applying some intelligent constructs that we have developed and documented in the last 10 years at FESSANJOSE (U. San José), leading DT in postsecondary education (PSEd). 5- Digital 360° architecture of DT Academy and Administration LOCUS: this architecture is the digital portfolio that implies the organization of the subsystems to obtain better and/or new functionalities based on knowledge to obtain an intelligent behavior. The DT multilayer-architecture approach is a system of systems (SoS) one, which ensures compliance with government policies, norms and standards, in a highly complex social institution with digital assets; this approach describes the subsystems at a higher level, where a system is composed, and with the protocols by which the subsystems communicate. It provides a 360° business vision map and a planning framework for commercial and technological changes. 6- The computational-mathematical perspective of DT, identifying endogenous and exogenous variables and their interrelations. 7- The synthesis, the Matrix of End-Means (EMM) that summarizes in DT: Where the HE is. In addition, where can the HE go? 8- The MIR Matrix, which describes DT Objectives, impacts-indicators and results. 9- The dynamic model of the DT system, based on computational intelligence, representing the system information control of all the components to achieve the completion of the DT. The intelligent management information system (iMIS) for PSEd, shows the dynamics of DT, integrating several multilevel system hybrid architectures, as a space to respond to the solution of the HE problems, tending to the desired competitiveness, specifically pointing out the way that these modern technologies can be included for their adaptation and evolution in PSEd in post-modernity, making governability, and teaching and student productivity compatible with educational high quality, the purpose of DT. The interface Results of the iMIS includes: high quality metrics, digitization rate progress, indicators (an special appendix on KPI were included) and values of management, desertion, answers, and plans. The Input Interface includes data, information and knowledge acquisition, where the attributes, parameters.",Pérez Gama J.; Rozo Pardo L.; Gutiérrez Martínez L.,Book,Artificial Intelligence Engineering for Postsecondary Education Digital Transformation,2019-01-01,Fundación de Educación Superior San José,
Developing a capability maturity model for smart tourism,"There has been an increased initiative to realize smart tourism in the world. Yet, there are un-pioneered challenges for the people who lead and manage smart tourism projects and realize its value in smart tourism (we call them as 'Smart tourism initiatives'), such as coordinating of tourism complexity, planning and sharing tourism strategy, sustaining tourism projects and innovation. In light of these challenges, the overall objective of this work is to design a holistic capability maturity model for smart tourism governance enabling sustainable tourism innovations via tackling the challenges above. The Dynamic capability theory was adopted as a theoretical lens, and the Design science research methodology was introduced to develop a new capability maturity governance model as a design artifact. And We could synthesize findings from iterations of the design research cycle based on the IT Capability Maturity Model. The results of the study propose a potential capability maturity model that supports effective communication and strategic alignment for the initiatives with illuminating future paths with evaluation methods on tourism capabilities for the initiatives. Throughout this study, we contribute to the body of knowledge as well as practice by proposing a new tourism capability governance model.",Lim C.; Baba K.; Iijima J.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 23rd Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems: Secure ICT Platform for the 4th Industrial Revolution, PACIS 2019",2019-01-01,Institute of Science Tokyo,Capability ;  Capability Maturity Model ;  Design Science ;  E-tourism ;  Governance ;  IT-CMF ;  Smart Tourism
On big data guided unconventional digital ecosystems and their knowledge management,"Establishing the reservoir connections is paramount in exploration and exploitation of unconventional petroleum systems and their reservoirs. In Big Data scale, multiple petroleum systems hold volumes and varieties of data sources. The connectivity between petroleum reservoirs and their existence in a single petroleum ecosystem is often ambiguously interpreted. They are heterogeneous and unstructured in multiple domains. They need better data integration methods to interpret the interplay between elements and processes of petroleum systems. Large-scale infrastructure is needed to build data relationships between different petroleum systems. The purpose of the research is to establish the connectivity between petroleum systems through resource data management and visual analytics. We articulate a Design Science Information System (DSIS) approach, bringing various artefacts together from multiple domains of petroleum provinces. The DSIS emerges as a knowledge-based digital ecosystem innovation, justifying its need, connecting geographically controlled petroleum systems and building knowledge of oil and gas prospects.",Nimmagadda S.; Reiners T.; Wood L.; Zhu D.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 23rd Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems: Secure ICT Platform for the 4th Industrial Revolution, PACIS 2019",2019-01-01,Curtin University;University of Otago,Big Data ;  Data Mining ;  Design Science ;  Digital Ecosystem ;  Unconventional Petroleum Reservoirs ;  Visual Analytics
Value operation: Linking value in new business model creation process,"Enterprise engineering is a discipline concerning designing and modeling an enterprise system. On creating a new business model, we can start from scratch ideation, or conduct innovation, manipulation, etc. of the current, existing business model. New Business Model Creation Process is a framework to conduct business model manipulation to create a new business. However, one of the seemingly important aspects of business is lost: Value.

Immunoglobulins,"Immunoglobulins (antibodies) are glycoprotein molecules that play a key role in adaptive immunity. Antibody is a Y shaped molecule made up of four polpeptides-2 heavy chains and 2 light chains. They protect us in the hostile environment of bacteria, viruses, and parasites. There are five classes of human immunoglobulins: IgM, IgG, IgA, IgE, and IgD. Most IgM antibodies are “natural” i.e., they are produced even without an antigenic stimulus. Their antigen-binding polyspecificity ensures them a role as a first line of defence mechanism against invading pathogens. IgG is the most abundant immunoglobulin isotype in human plasma. The ability of IgG antibodies to bind with a high affinity and specificity to a remarkably large variety of antigens is their main feature. It combats microbes and their toxins. Serum IgA has effects similar to these of IgG, while secretory IgA antibodies are resistant to proteases and protect all mucosal surfaces. IgE is the class with the lowest plasma concentration. The contact of mast cell-bound IgE with the specific antigen results in an acute inflammatory reaction that might help to expel parasites from the gut. IgE antibodies are also believed to have a role in the host defense against noxious environmental substances, including venoms, environmental xenobiotics, and irritants IgD is primarily found on surface of mature B cells and is probably involved in lymphocyte activation. An immunoglobulin superfamily of which antibody is a large and diverse group of protein comprising antibodies. Antibodies can swiftly provide therapeutics to target disease-related molecules discovered in genomic research.

Strengthening of thin curve members by topological modification and estimation by strain energy method,"In the world of engineering, mechanical members are subjected to complex loading and the challenges are growing day by day which has led to several innovations. Today the loading members are not just straight but curved with other modifications such as simple curves and deep curves with varied thickness such as for thin members. These thin curved members are available in various topological form such C or L shaped geometry and are seen regularly in our day to day life, such as hooks, angles, handles, etc. In this paper we deal with the strengthening of simple thin curve industrial grade members with least modification in its topology and analyzing the results for increased in Strain Energy by the use of mathematical modeling and FEM software available in ANSYS 2019 R3 CAD version by Ansys Inc. The results showed that with the modifications as done in this research there is about 18.93% increase in the strain energy loading capacity of a member by introducing a straight section in the beam while maintaining the end points same as for the original thin curve member under test.",Shrivastava A.; Saini R.,Conference Proceeding,Materials Today: Proceedings,2019-01-01,Jabalpur Engineering College,ANSYS ;  Curved ;  Finite element method ;  Straight section ;  Strain energy
Embedding creativity in engineering degree programmes,"According to Lucas and Hanson [1] in a paper that formed the basis of a report by the Royal Academy of Engineering, engineering education now stifles, and indeed suppresses the creative and innovative capacities of students at a time when the UK Government [2] maintains innovation is key to delivering prosperity. The irony is, of course, that the very meaning of the word “engineer” has its roots in the ancient word “gene” – to invent, bring into being or create. This problem is possibly being compounded by the UK Department for Education taking its cues from a Chief Scientific Advisor – with a background in economic history – whose views on creativity and the value schools add in that sphere are poles apart from substantial evidence to the contrary. If uncorrected, the course our government is charting may well consign the UK to economic history. Convinced of the “creativity gap” in higher education, the authors of this paper outline the key principles uncovered following very recent ongoing, small-scale research that shows how innovation and creativity could be embedded in any design or engineering degree programme and how these qualities could not only improve outcomes for graduates, but also the UK’s place in the global economy.",Finlay J.; Papworth A.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Towards a New Innovation Landscape, E and PDE 2019",2019-01-01,Liverpool John Moores University,Creativity ;  Design ;  Economy ;  Education ;  Engineering ;  Innovation
Piloting mobile mixed reality to enhance building information modelling delivery in construction education,"With new building information modelling (BIM) workflows becoming required within the architecture, engineering and construction industry, more research is required to understand the best pedagogical delivery methods of this new spatial technology workflow. Mixed reality (MR) and mobile visualisation methods are identified as important technology drivers for rethinking higher education, practice driving learner engagement and spatial information delivery. This paper outlines qualitative results derived through thematic analysis of learner observation and reflections from a technology-enhanced lecture, and hands-on workshop focused on MR-BIM innovation within the construction industry. Forty-five (45) participants from a postgraduate construction course at an Australian University participated in answering the research question: “How do learners perceive the interactive visualisation mode of a presentation delivered through MR-BIM and mobile pedagogy?”. The results of the analysis identified two general themes (learning and technology) and five sub-themes (learning engagement, learning experience, technology experience, technology readiness and technology future). Students felt engaged during the session with observation supporting the reflective analysis evidenced by learners asking questions, commenting on technology possibilities and sharing of their experiences between peers, lecturers and social networks. More work is required on the delivery method, with only one-third of the reflections discussing the learning.",Birt J.; Vasilevski N.,Conference Proceeding,"ASCILITE 2019 - Conference Proceedings - 36th International Conference of Innovation, Practice and Research in the Use of Educational Technologies in Tertiary Education: Personalised Learning.

Education innovation through material innovation in primary education: The ‘Grow-it-yourself’ workshop,"In recent years more STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) topics have been incorporated in mainstream public education. Although the benefits of STEM instruction are broadly recognised in secondary school curricula, STEM topics in primary education are rather limited, leaving a gap in manipulative skills building and in preparation processes for the next school level. This paper reflects on the outcomes of a design workshop attended by 12 primary school students (9 to 12 years old) in Belgium. Mycelium, a fungi-based natural material now used in innovative sustainable applications, served as a means to introduce early learners engineering basics through self-made learning tools. Students grew their own 3-D structures to build a ‘Grow-It-Yourself’ biodegradable playground using mycelium as a primary source. The paper stems from an in-progress research that investigates the opportunities of how mycelium as a material innovation can be used as a medium to create innovation in primary education through a learning-by-design approach. Reflections on the workshop’s instructional guidelines are included along with an extension of the call for support for primary school teachers delivering STEM topics in their classes.",Brosens L.; Emmanouil M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Towards a New Innovation Landscape, E and PDE 2019",2019-01-01,Universiteit Gent,Creativity ;  Learning by doing/design ;  Mycelium ;  Primary education ;  STE(A)M-education ;  Sustainability ;  Workshop guidelines
More than construction innovation: The interdisciplinary challenge of prefabricated schools,"Australian education departments use relocatable prefabricated classrooms extensively to respond rapidly and economically to fluctuating student numbers and as emergency accommodation. Prefabrication has not been widely used for permanent school infrastructure, but this recently changed in response to unprecedented increases in student numbers. Permanent prefabrication is currently being commissioned by Australia's two largest state education departments to quickly roll-out quality infrastructure. These multi-billion-dollar government school programs represent a major opportunity for step changes in the nation's construction industry with the potential for a shift from off-site conventional construction towards off-site manufacturing and mass customisation. The scale of the program has the potential to catalyse investment for cutting edge design performance, mass customisation ability and the adoption of digital engineering including building information modelling across the life-cycle. The programs could also leverage recent research into learning environments for changing pedagogies. This paper provides contextual data on prefabrication in Australia and argues a case for prefabrication being conceptualised and evaluated not only in terms of construction innovation but also as a design conversation with users. This approach requires breaking down of interdisciplinary boundaries given siloed structures not only within government education departments but also more broadly within university research and industry practice.",Newton C.; Backhouse S.; Aibinu A.; Soccio P.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International Conference of Architectural Science Association,2019-01-01,University of Melbourne,Flexible school design ;  Interdisciplinary research ;  Permanent prefabricated schools ;  Post-occupancy evaluation
Transdisciplinary design practices in education: A complex search for innovation in nature,"Working across, between or even beyond established disciplines necessitates effective collaboration, and there are well acknowledged models of associating business and science. Evidence suggests a worldwide increase of cross-disciplinary working as partnerships transcend the confines of predefined and historical silos. However, associations between design, engineering and many branches of life science, lags. While there is increasing interest in bioinspired design, formalised methods are not, as yet, well established, adopted in industry or part of design curricula. Biomimicry as a route to innovation is currently thought to rely on the collaboration between the diverse disciplines of biology, design and engineering in order to be successful. However, current academic research into multidisciplinary collaboration within engineering and product design education appears limited. This study describes the findings of a small-scale research project exploring the attitudes of professionals in relevant fields regarding interdisciplinary collaboration with a specific focus on biomimicry. The work compares current views on collaborative work in biomimicry with the opinions of an expert panel. Two rounds of questionnaires utilising the Delphi method were used to gain insights from an anonymised panel of experts. The research concluded that while biologist/designer collaboration can spark imagination and enthusiasm, it is a challenging process and its efficacy will depend upon understanding and motivation from the onset. The discussion and conclusions focus on the need for more efficient methods to encourage successful collaboration across life sciences and the impact on design education at HE and beyond. Importantly it draws attention to possible attitudes of indifference towards inter and transdisciplinary partnerships.",McCardle J.; Angus R.; Trott J.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Towards a New Innovation Landscape, E and PDE 2019",2019-01-01,Loughborough University,Biomimetics ;  Collaboration ;  Design education ;  Disciplinary research ;  Life sciences
Exploration of new innovation scenarios through the reinterpretation of local material culture in the master in design,"Our master's degree in integrated design is a teaching project designed to protect, predominantly, a series of professional specialisations. It is a precursor to the mission of the educational institution where it works, namely in its search for the economic, social impact and cultural in the region where it is inserted. The theme of this year's project challenged the students to develop new perspectives on the local tableware whose style that has contributed to the characterisation of the city's identity. From the concept of contemporaneity, and the idea of the need for a ""new filling"", in keeping with the new aesthetic-functional and symbolic requirements of its inhabitants, the project aimed to contribute to the recovery of the image of the city as an important centre of dynamisation of an industrial sector with tradition in the region. In establishing partnerships with entities and companies, the project work was supported by the City Museum, City Hall, Industries of the Region and professionals in various areas of design and related (architecture, engineering, anthropology, etc.). The realisation of the project in design implied a phased work process from the research on the problem, through the generation of ideas until its materialisation. In the end, the project showed that the dishes drawn here may in the future achieve great notoriety as a result of the good interpretation of the material culture that preceded them, and the quality of their design. It is concluded that the recovery of the history of the city's ceramics can contribute to stimulate more innovation and creativity in the future.",Martins J.; Mota L.; Cavaleiro R.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Towards a New Innovation Landscape, E and PDE 2019",2019-01-01,"Centro de Investigação em Arquitetura, Urbanismo e Design;Instituto Politécnico de Viana do Castelo",Ceramics ;  Cultural heritage ;  Master’s in design ;  Product design

A pilot study: A case study of design teaching applying the internet crowdsourcing technology for undergraduate design students,"Since the design education system was first established and spread to the public by Bauhaus in Weimar, during 1919, people began to realise the necessity and rationality of design education in various design domains. Currently, design has strongly combined with the new emerged internet technologies (i.e., crowdsourcing technology), and recent research results suggested that crowdsourcing design method (i.e., Crowdsourced Design Framework) provides innovations for design. Consequently, the teaching of crowdsourced design method for the undergraduate design students has become increasingly important. Unfortunately, at present, it was hardly found that this application in the current design course module. In this paper, the authors firstly investigated the application of crowdsourced design method (i.e., Crowdsourced Design Framework) for undergraduate industrial design students. This paper is structured by 5 sections. Section 1 gives a brief introduction of the development of design education, Internet crowdsourcing technology and the latest related research findings on it. Section 2, authors illustrate the Crowdsourcing-based Design Teaching Workflow (CBDTW). Section 3 shows a case study using the CBDTW for the 2nd year undergraduate industrial design students in Sichuan University. Students’ design results are shown and discussed in section 4. This paper ends by section 5 as the conclusion, limitation and the future work. Students applied crowdsourcing technology to generate design concepts, evaluate designs and improve designs. Importantly, it is worth introducing the latest crowdsourced design research results to students, which potentially helps them understand how design research changes the way of design.",Wu H.; Gan J.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Towards a New Innovation Landscape, E and PDE 2019",2019-01-01,Sichuan University,Crowdsourced design ;  Crowdsourcing ;  Crowdsourcing-based design teaching workflow (CBDTW) ;  Design education ;  Internet supported design ;  Undergraduate education
Efficacious prototyping for early stage industrial design: Understanding what matters in prototyping to make prototyping matter more,"Prototypes are integral tools designers, engineers and other creatives utilise for developing solutions. In the broadest sense, the term ‘prototype’ may mean different things, and be the means to different ends. Prototypes play a significant role in idea generation in the early stages of design projects and can act as a catalyst for innovation in a collaborative setting. Successful prototypes are thoughtful about their purpose and context of usage. This makes it important to understand how attributes of the prototype and the prototyping process affect the design process. The landscape of design is evolving– increasingly efficient and sophisticated technology is used in the prototyping process. Multiple stakeholders and end-users are involved throughout the design process, which makes collaborative prototyping and co-creation a valuable activity. The objective of this project is to utilise such an understanding to improve the tools and technologies to better support design teams through their process. Secondary source research and semi-structured interviews with designers have been conducted to understand the challenges faced and to investigate the attributes of prototyping such as modality (physical versus digital), fidelity (high versus low), materials and processes used, effort and time spent, and their effect on the process. Throughout a dynamic design process, prototyping can be a part of different phases of a project, can involve different sets of stakeholders, and can need to perform in different ways. A key theme to the findings has been that ‘economy’ and ‘effectiveness’ are broad needs from the prototyping process, and that specific needs - what is meant by economy and effectiveness - can vary across different scenarios.",Mahtani R.; Umstead K.; Gill C.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Towards a New Innovation Landscape, E and PDE 2019",2019-01-01,NC State University,Collaboration ;  Engineering ;  Industrial design ;  Product design ;  Product development ;  Prototyping ;  Technology

Beyond the healthcare paradigm: Co-creating a new model for collaborative transdisciplinary healthcare design education,"Although healthcare has long been a focus for design research dating from the 1960’s and Bruce Archer’s Industrial Design (Engineering) research unit, there remain very few academic programmes in the field of healthcare design and even fewer that go beyond classic user driven models. This paper reports on a unique collaboration between the Royal College of Art and Imperial College in London to develop an innovative partnership and programme structure between two diverse collaborating institutions. Moreover, the partnership has shown how new design and healthcare research methods have been used for innovative practice-based healthcare design projects. We reflect on the diverse skill sets and approaches that have evolved through collaborative teamwork between healthcare practitioners, designers and diverse disciplinary backgrounds. Our conclusions illustrate how a context driven programme provides evidence of a new ‘post-disciplinary’ mindset and explores implications for research and practice for the future of healthcare design.",Hall A.; Leff D.; Wojdecka A.; Kinross J.; Thompson P.; Darzi A.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Towards a New Innovation Landscape, E and PDE 2019",2019-01-01,Royal College of Art;Imperial College London,Design innovation ;  Future of health ;  Healthcare design ;  Transdisciplinary education
What (and how) to teach designers about humanitarian innovation?,"The Global Innovation Design (GID) master’s programme aims to develop research and teaching collaboration opportunities between international academic institutions, and among a range of international Governmental and Non-Governmental Organisations. A theme of increasing interest is humanitarian innovation, in which many organisations are actively engaged. However, most academic documentation is in engineering and the humanities; there is little scholarly, empirical examination of design-led interdisciplinary methods and practice, spanning this fertile and important intersection, or of educational efforts to equip future designers with appropriate skills and knowledge. This paper outlines the developing educational context of experiential learning applied to innovation for disaster management and humanitarian response. Two examples of student design workshops on the subject of humanitarian or emergency response are described, to illustrate some of the benefits of immersive learning in this subject area (such as increased empathy and contextual understanding) weighed against the challenges (such as risk of physical or emotional harm) involved in first-hand encounter.",Stevens J.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Towards a New Innovation Landscape, E and PDE 2019",2019-01-01,Royal College of Art,Design ;  Disaster ;  Experiential learning ;  Humanitarian ;  Innovation
Leveraging new product innovation through R and D practices in engineering manufacturing sector: A study in Indian context,"This paper presents a framework for scrutinising the interrelationship and impact of constituents of Research &Development (R&D) Practices on new product innovation (PI) success, besides identifying those. Such cited factors, deemed to be critical, are R&D investment, technology, learning, intellectual capital as well as the fuzzy front end (FFE) activities followed by improvisation for innovation. Product innovation has grown into a compelling strategy of manufacturing industries for confronting volatility and rapid changes of market due to globalisation. The aforementioned practices lead to the technological developments of the firm resulting in PI success. An interrelationship framework considering factors of R&D practices and technological improvement is developed, in this work, using structural equation modelling (SEM) approach. The magnitude of the interrelationship, investigated indicates that technology, learning and intellectual capital directly influence R and D effort, which in turn escalates PI.

Product and technology (innovation) diffusion economics' time relation to abandonment,"The pace of business is naturally accelerating due to technology and innovation advancements; as such, to maintain relevance and a competitive advantage an organization must understand and use time wisely. Thus, the exploration of product/technology (innovation) diffusion economics, and its relationship to time has great value to decision makers within an organization. Previous research demonstrated via economic impact that when a technology or innovation has a fast diffusion rate, an organization's decision-makers should endeavor to make quicker decisions when compared to a technology or innovation with a slower diffusion rate. Expanding on this research, the Diffusion Time Value, a standardized economic measure referenced to units of time, is used in this paper to explore the economic importance of understanding a product/technology (innovation) diffusion stages in relation to its abandonment point. This framework provides knowledge for an organization's decision makers to make better decisions in relation to time, for the understanding and use of time within an organization can be used as a competitive advantage for growth.",Parvin A.; Beruvides M.,Conference Proceeding,"2019 International Annual Conference Proceedings of the American Society for Engineering Management and 40th Meeting Celebration: A Systems Approach to Engineering Management Solutions, ASEM 2019",2019-01-01,Texas Tech University;Southwest Research Institute,Diffusion time value ;  Innovation diffusion ;  S-curve ;  Technology ;  Technology and innovation abandonment ;  Technology diffusion
Genetic improvement of wine yeasts,"In recent years, wine market is undergoing a change due to the ever-growing request to improve the sensory features and nutritional properties of the final product. Most wine production is based on the use of starter cultures consisting of selected strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, able to ensure quick and controlled fermentations. However, the reduced number of really different starters can lead to a wine standardization resulting in flattening of taste. Moreover, there is a still growing request of winemaking process innovation of the and, in this sense, yeasts can play a central role. In order to gain innovative characteristics, the research relies on the isolation and selection of new oenological strains of S. cerevisiae and non-Saccharomyces species showing interesting metabolic or technological features, or on the improvement of wine yeasts at genetic level. In the case of the latter approach, examples to obtain both non-Genetically Modified (GM) and GM organisms (GMO) are available in literature. In this chapter we discuss the significant developments of the genetic engineering based on standard homologous integration, the inter and intraspecific hybridization in wine yeasts, the use of random mutagenesis, the foundation of the experimental evolution strategy and we describe the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing approach that has been revolutionizing the field of biotechnology.",Vigentini I.; Gonzalez R.; Tronchoni J.,Book,Yeasts in the Production of Wine,2019-01-01,CSIC-CAR-UR - Instituto de Ciencias de la Vid y del Vino (ICVV);Università degli Studi di Milano,

Bringing computational thinking to nonengineering students through a capstone course,"Although the concept of computational thinking has flourished, little research has explored how to integrate various elements of computational thinking into an undergraduate classroom setting. Clarifying core concepts of computational thinking and providing empirical cases that apply computational thinking practices into a real-world educational setting is crucial to the success of software engineering education. In this article, we describe the development of a curriculum for a social innovation capstone course, using core concepts and elements of computational thinking. The course was designed for undergraduate students of a liberal arts college at a university in Korea.

Intelligent feedback systems in higher education - why and how?,"Universities tend to think that they know their students very well, but in real life conditions, many aspects are being left out of the consideration. This paper has set the main focus on the Information and Communication Technology based feedback systems for collection and analysis of student feedback who are mainly studying engineering sciences about everyday student life issues (such as study content, teachers, class schedule, satisfaction rates, environment, accessibility of resources and other). In the paper, authors propose a model of student feedback system that could intelligently address the gap between what student wants and thinks - what higher education institutions know about their students. Authors also review current offerings of the systems and addresses feedback as a part of quality assurance and demand driven University actions. With simple, but intelligent solution it would be possible to easily obtain and work with the information about neglected courses, personalized schedules, student voting, extracurricular activities, student research and more. Author also elaborates on perspective of social innovation that comes in a shape of new organizational form, where quality, decisions, and activities are bound to the continuous feedback that gets collected from the students. This would help Universities all across the globe to establish indisputable evidence for their actions. Challenge here lies within the responsibility of students to give correct, precise, honest and timely feedback. Findings of the paper are based on the literature review as well as five international expert discussions executed in the period of 2015-2017 in five different countries.",Valtins K.; Muracova N.,Conference Proceeding,eLearning and Software for Education Conference,2019-01-01,Riga Technical University,Feedback ;  Governance ;  Student services

"Rethinking buildings design, construction and management through sustainable technologies and digitization","Atechnological development not threatening natural and human life is one of the core concepts of sustainability. In the construction sector, which is worldwide responsible of a huge consumption of energy and natural resources, thus strongly impacting on climate change, sustainability requires a prompt transition towards ecofriendly, smart and resilient buildings. However, despite the current Forth Industrial Revolution, where many sectors have been able to transform themselves improving productivity while lowering the environmental impact, construction is still suffering from several intrinsic backwardness. A new approach is required. Sustainable product innovation and process digitalization are established roadmaps to reinventing construction throughout the whole building life-cycle: conception and design, planning and execution, operation and maintenance, end-of-life, reuse and recycling. This paper goes back over the major research results achieved by Construction division of the Department of Civil and Building Engineering and Architecture of Università Politecnica delle Marche in this context. It also outlines the emerging challenges and future directions of the research in this long-established sector.",Carbonari A.; Di Giuseppe E.; D’Orazio M.; Giretti A.; Lemma M.; Munafò P.; Naticchia B.; Quagliarini E.; Stazi F.; Vaccarini M.,Book,The First Outstanding 50 Years of “Università Politecnica delle Marche”: Research Achievements in Physical Sciences and Engineering,2019-01-01,Università Politecnica delle Marche,
Factors influencing the adoption of software defined networking by research and educational networks,"Software Defined Networking (SDN) can deliver many benefits to Research and Educational Networks (RENs) and the educational institutions they serve. However, there is limited adoption by the RENs. This paper presents a theoretical model for investigating the SDN adoption by RENs based on the Diffusion of Innovation Theory (DOI) and emphasizes the Technology, Organization, and Environment (TOE) framework. Both theories are widely used in Information Systems adoption research studies at a firm level. The construct components of the study derived from prior literature are 1) Environment (technology support, regulation policies), 2) SDN Technology (advantages, compatibility, complexity, testability, security, observability), 3) Organization (REN size, REN global scope, network user profile), and 4) Human Factor (opinionated leaders, team skills). The model can be used for creating a survey instrument for further researching the adoption process of the SDN paradigm among public and private organizations.",Chergarova V.; Bezerra J.; Ibarra J.; Morgan H.,Conference Proceeding,"25th Americas Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS 2019",2019-01-01,University of Southern California;Florida International University,Adoption ;  Research and education networks ;  Software defined network ;  Technology
Development of an innovative multi-performance system for LWS structures,"Nowadays the key topics of the construction sector are safety and eco-efficiency. In the last decades, the Lightweight Steel (LWS) systems made of Cold Formed Steel (CFS) profiles have shown high structural and environmental performances, joining perfectly the new trend. In this perspective, the University of Naples “Federico II”, in cooperation with Lamieredil S.p.A. Company, has recently started a new research project. The main goal of the project is the development of a new solution with high seismic and environmental performances. From the structural point of view, the innovation consists in a CFS profile wall, equipped with pre-tensioned Ultra High Strength (UHS) steel braces, which are able to limit global displacement of structure and to dissipate seismic energy by its yielding. The effectiveness of the wall system will be proved through several tests carried out at Lab of the Department of Structures for Engineering and Architecture. The experimental activity will include tests on materials and assemblies, monotonic and cyclic tests on full-scale components and shake-table tests on a building mock-up. From the environmental point of view, more appropriate materials for the envelope will be selected and production and erection processes of the system will be analysed, in order to obtain higher acoustic and thermal performances and reduction of waste. As a conclusion, a prototype building will be erected, tested and monitored on the company property. The paper summarizes the research project in detail, the experimental program and the design of the innovative system and prototype.",Campiche A.,Conference Proceeding,SDSS 2019 - International Colloquium on Stability and Ductility of Steel Structures,2019-01-01,Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II,
Social awareness in design & engineer education and practice. The value of ethics in postgraduate education,"This paper describes how the practice of ethics and morality in design and engineering education can foster an industry which is ethically capable of tackling social issues. Through ethically aware design methodologies that postgraduate cross discipline students developed through workshops, this paper outlines and discusses possible directions and methods that design, and engineering education could evolve with further study. What can ethics awareness in postgraduate education trigger and how can it influence future design and engineering practice? For the major role morality and ethics have in ruling social coexistence designers and engineers are called to take responsibility of any action that shapes behaviour between people, products and systems. To respond to the need of a collective ethical etiquette that products and systems can encode, design research at the Royal College of Art has been supporting a practice that acknowledges impacts and people’s responsibilities. A series of workshops will describe the role of collaboration and engagement in drawing ethically aware design and engineering processes; it will be evidenced how these are strategic in modulating relationships and behaviours and in guiding the mapping of the interactions of people with people and machines to acknowledge roles, responsibilities and the ownership of decision making. The intention of this paper is not to draw conclusions on what ethics is and how it should be practiced, but to support the development of guidelines that can engage design and engineering education and industry with debates on responsibilities and decision making across the lifecycle of a product, system, service or infrastructure. This paper intends to be an engaged, collegial and collaborative contribution to the topic of ethics in design/engineering education and practice.",Ferraello L.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Towards a New Innovation Landscape, E and PDE 2019",2019-01-01,Royal College of Art,Collaboration ;  Design methods ;  Engineering ;  Ethics ;  Future of education ;  Future of practice in design ;  Innovation ;  Responsibility
Stakeholder mapping of controlled environment agriculture utilizing the technological innovation system framework,"Year round demand for fresh produce in the US is met by the modern food distribution system. To meet growing consumer demand, engineered solutions must efficiently use material resources and space, and be widely applicable. Controlled environment agriculture (CEA) offers the potential to supplement food production through precision management of plant-growth related factors by increasing resource use efficiencies and product quality. To date, little work has analyzed the role that public and private stakeholders play in CEA innovation and technology diffusion. The goal of this research was to conceptualize CEA from a multidimensional stakeholder perspective and to identify opportunities and challenges that influence technological potential, decision-making, and consumer acceptance. To develop a common engineering focus, a stakeholder needs assessment that included inclusive design and management, site suitability, assembly, acceptability, and utilization was required. A framework was developed to characterize CEA actors by utilizing the technological innovation systems (TIS) framework as an analytical lens. Stakeholder mapping identified relevant actors and groups, analyzed perspectives and interests, and visually represented relationships to missions/objectives and other actors, while prioritizing relevant issues. Results showed that CEA was mostly perceived as a commercial activity as opposed to a social one. Opportunities and barriers linked to CEA were categorized as technical, economic, environmental, and social. The common engineering focus surrounding CEA stakeholders included: food production, product enhancement, materials management, reducing resource consumption, and reducing waste. This work will provide critical empirical data to verify claims associated with CEA as well as a foundation for future studies.",Smith R.; Stwalley R.,Conference Proceeding,2019 ASABE Annual International Meeting,2019-01-01,,Controlled environment agriculture ;  Stakeholder mapping ;  Technological innovation system
Unlocking the full potential: The psychological factors that influence the adoption of new technologies in the upstream oil and gas industry,"Innovation is critical to the future success of the oil and gas industry. Yet, the sector has a reputation for being conservative and reluctant to adopt new technology with companies sometimes referred to as ""fast followers"". Compared to other sectors, O&G has a set of unique characteristics that has the potential to hinder technology adoption. Research in other industries indicates that there is a range of sector, organizational and psychological factors that can hinder the introduction of new technologies. Evidence from O&G industry bodies indicate that the psychological factors play a key role in technology adoption; not surprisingly, as workers, managers, investors and regulators can all have a powerful influence on an organisation's receptivity to new technology. The psychological factors do not appear to be well understood but may include risk aversion (Wood Review, 2014), lack of ownership and leadership around technology (OGTC, 2018), and an attitude of reluctance to change (Oil and Gas Authority, 2018). This new research project is designed to examine how the particular attributes of the upstream oil and gas industry on the United Kingdom Continental Shelf interact with the underlying psychological processes that govern adoption and deployment decisions. The presentation will first outline what can be learned from about the psychological factors that influence technology innovation and adoption from the broader consumer behaviour and human factors literatures. Then the preliminary results of an interview study with stakeholders involved in technology innovation and adoption on the UKCS, will be reported. Roles include senior managers, innovation leads, and end users from a spectrum of established and new comer companies. A summary of the key themes identified will be discussed including personality (e.g. innovativeness), attitude (e.g. risk aversion), cognitive (e.g. risk perception), social (subjective norms) and organisational level factors (e.g. leadership and organisational culture). These results are being used to develop a preliminary framework of the psychological factors that influence technology adoption in O&G and to produce tools and guidelines on how to support the introduction of new technologies.",Roberts R.; Flin R.; Millar D.; Corradi L.,Conference Proceeding,"Society of Petroleum Engineers - SPE Offshore Europe Conference and Exhibition 2019, OE 2019",2019-01-01,Robert Gordon University;Oil and Gas Technology Centre,
Basic research of tissue engineering in China: Bibliometric analysis,"BACKGROUND: The development of tissue engineering is of great social and economic significance. Understanding the current status of basic research in this field can provide reference for developing corresponding development strategies. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate China's basic research current status in the field of tissue engineering. METHODS: A computer-based online search of Pubmed was performed to retrieve basic research papers and top papers in the field of tissue engineering using search terms MESH terms AND free-text word. In the context of global background, China’s ability of basic research in the field of tissue engineering was analyzed based on the number of papers, the growth of the number of papers, the number and proportion of top papers. In addition, the number of papers was used to identify the global research hotspots in the field of tissue engineering. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The top five countries in the field of tissue engineering were the United States, China, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom. The total number of papers in this field published by Chinese scholars reached 17,031, second only to the United States. The compound annual growth rate of the number of papers was 19.9%, and the number of top papers was 195, ranking first and last among the top five countries, respectively. Eight Chinese institutions ranked top 30 in the number of papers in this field, with an average growth rate of 21.2%, far higher than that of all the top 30 institutions in the world (21.2% vs. 14.2, P < 0.001). However, Chinese institutions produced fewer top papers as compared to other top institutions, with the proportion of top papers significantly lower than that of the average level of the top 30 institutions (2.0% vs. 5.2%; P=0.002). There were five Chinese researchers whose total publications entered top 25 of the world. China's research in tissue engineering focuses on the areas of bone and cartilage, nerves, liver, skin, heart and eye tissue engineering, which is consistent with the global status. China's basic research in the field of tissue engineering ranks second in the world and expands rapidly in recent years. A number of academic institutions and individuals with great achievements have emerged. However, China's research quality in this field is relatively low as compared to other top institutions. It is suggested to guide researchers to pay more attention to the quality and transformation of research output, and to support the development of basic subjects such as material science to lay a good foundation for the development of tissue engineering in China.",Juan C.; Yidan W.; Ting Z.; Shu Y.; Tingting W.; Yusheng Y.; Zhaolian O.,Journal,Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research,2019-01-01,"Institute of Medical Information & Library, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College;Peking University Health Science Center",Basic research ;  Bibliometrics ;  Innovation power ;  Medical device ;  Research hotspot ;  Scientific paper ;  Tissue engineering ;  Top paper

Prospects and application of curvilinear distraction osteogenesis,"BACKGROUND: Insufficient development of craniofacial bone and jaw defects are common problems in clinical practice of maxillofacial surgery. How to repair is always a problem. Because distraction osteogenesis has the advantages of small trauma, avoiding bone grafting, and prolonging the synchronization of surrounding soft tissue, it holds critical role in increasing alveolar bone mass, prolonging jaw bone, repairing bone defect, and closing bone gap. OBJECTIVE: To summarize and discuss the technical methods, application, limitations and development trends of various curved distractors. METHODS: Relevant articles published from January 2000 to October 2018 were retrieved from CNKI, WanFang, PubMed and Embase databases and National Intellectual Property Office Patent Search and Analysis Platform. The key words were “distraction osteogenesis, curvilinear distraction, curved distractor, reconstruction, research progress, mandibular, maxilla, defect, customized distractor, finite element method” in Chinese and English, respectively. Fifty-eight eligible articles were included for review. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) The early distraction osteogenesis devices are mostly external unidirectional distractors. With the development of various technologies, various intra-oral distractors, such as spiral distractor, curve distractor, bidirectional distractor, three-focus distractor and automatic distractor. (2) In view of the special anatomical shape of the jaw, there are many arc-faced structures. In order to make the new bone closer to the contour shape of the jaw, curved distraction osteogenesis has gradually become a research hotspot. (3) Although the existing curved distractors provide a reliable technical means for jaw defects, they still have a certain degree of limitation. Due to the existence of problems such as traction and force, the true meaning curve and even the three-dimensional distraction are not completed. The development of individualized stretchers combined with relevant innovations, and towards miniaturization and stabilization development is still the mainstream trend of future research on curvilinear distraction.",Zhou Y.; Zhou L.; Piao Z.,Journal,Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research,2019-01-01,Stomatological Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University,Mandible ;  Maxilla ;  Oral ;  Surgery ;  Tissue Engineering ;  Traction

Crowd engineering - Approach for smart and agile product development in networks,"Product life cycles are getting shorter. Companies are working to shorten development of new products and ramp-up of production. Based on increased customization, the production volume is reduced, too. In view of the magic triangle of production optimization, companies are forced to reduce (1) costs and (2) time while ensuring consistent (3) quality. The introduction of Crowd Engineering can support companies in their task of improving their product development approaches. By integrating professionals as well as nonprofessionals in the product development processes, well-designed products with reduced utilization of human resources are possible. The current research shows major requirements and challenges, which need to be addressed: Whom does the crowd to be addressed consist of? How can development tasks be outsourced to the crowd and how can the results be reintegrated into internal processes of the company? Which areas can be co-worked by the crowd? Companies must identify their core issues in engineering in order to manage efforts sensibly. With the definition of tasks for the community, it is required to identify appropriate interfaces to provide space for open innovation through the crowd. The tasks should focus on areas without relevance for competition, thus avoiding making intellectual property rights publicly available.

Genetic engineering applications to improve cellulase production and efficiency: Part II,"Cellulase production with superior expertise is an immense challenge in biomass deconstruction due to its high cost. The field of enzyme/genetic/biotechnology has now been transformed into a new era of innovations to dichotomize complex practices and mechanisms for a better understanding to achieve superior productivity of cellulase and its efficiency with anticipated features. Traditional approaches utilizing mutagenesis, whether chemical and/or physical, are incompetent and time consuming, hence utilization of rational strategies to amend cellulase production is worth seeking. Consequently, all-inclusive research is challenging metabolic flexibility and the adaptive potential of prokaryotes. Trapping and investigation of genetic architecture of novel microorganisms for cellulolytic enzymes and their expression in heterologous and homologous systems with highly precise activities and superior proficiencies is in progress. Affluent cloning of cellulases encoding genes from microbes and their expression analysis can result in the paramount upsurge in the usage of sustainable natural resources for development of low-cost efficacious industrial applications. Efficient molecular and genetic engineering methods can generate desired alterations in robust genetic circuits and deliver dominant implements for engineering nonnative organisms to produce cellulase.

Deep Learning for Internet of Things Data Analytics,"The recent technological innovations and brisk amalgamation of domains such as sensing and actuating technologies, embedded systems, wireless communication, and data analytics are accelerating the growth of Internet of Things (IoT). The massive number of sensors deployed in IoT generate humongous volumes of data for a broad range of applications such as smart home, smart healthcare, smart manufacturing, smart transportation, smart grid, smart agriculture etc. Analyzing such data in order to facilitate enhanced decision making, increase productivity and accuracy, ameliorate revenue is a critical process that makes IoT a precious idea for businesses and a standard of life improving paradigm. Although deriving concealed information and inferences out of IoT data is promising to improve the standard of our lives, it is a complicated task that cannot be accomplished by conventional paradigms. Deep Learning would play a vital role in creating smarter IoT as it has shown remarkable results in different fields including image recognition, information retrieval, speech recognition, natural language processing, indoor localization, physiological and psychological state detection etc. and these form the foundation services for IoT applications. In this regard, investigating the potential of Deep Learning for IoT data analytics becomes indispensable. Motivated to address this concern, this paper explores the flair of Deep Learning for analyzing data generated from IoT environments. A detailed discussion on various Deep Learning architectures, their role in IoT data analytics and potential use cases is also presented. Finally, open research challenges and future research directions are discussed in order to promote future research in this domain.",Saleem T.; Chishti M.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Computer Science,2019-01-01,National Institute of Technology Srinagar,Data Analytics ;  Deep Learning ;  Internet of Things
Morphology Evolution and Interfacial Design of Conjugated Polymer-Based Photovoltaics,"Organic solar cells (OSCs) are rapidly advancing the pace of third generation photovoltaic research. In the past decade, conjugated polymers have achieved great success as both active layers and interfacial layers in OSCs, due to the innovations in material design and synthesis, morphology control and optimization, and device interfacial engineering. In this chapter, we will focus on the significant advances that have been made recently in understanding and manipulating the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) film morphology and interfacial design of OSCs. Beginning with a general introduction that overviews breakthroughs in OSCs, we place emphasis on the active layer morphologies of several typical material systems, the parameters that dictate the evolution of the morphologies, and describe general techniques to optimize morphology for efficient solar cells. After a discussion of the bulk film morphology, we discuss interface design with conjugated polymers, including the morphology and structure of the interlayers and their influence on device performance. Finally, we conclude with an outlook that describes promising opportunities for conjugated polymers to be used in some other emerging photovoltaic technologies.",Liu Y.; Russell T.,Book,"Conjugated Polymers: Properties, Processing, and Applications",2019-01-01,Beijing University of Chemical Technology;University of Massachusetts Amherst;Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,
Open innovation learning: From concepts to targeted competences,"Open innovation represents a present major strategy for companies aiming a development dynamic based on novelty. Open innovation highlights the concept of networking as enterprises position themselves in an inside and outside double process of knowledge acquisition and diffusion to foster their own new activities development and possibly those of their partners. This co-innovation approach may involve close known partners (customers, suppliers, regular interlocutors among others), entities purposely contacted (this includes academic structures specifically associated to a project, distant companies holding complementary know how and start-ups) and also occasional or fuzzy contributors (members of social networks, specialist mobilized by internet innovation intermediaries among others). Open innovation is associated with some theoretical problematic including the question of the necessary abilities of people in charge of this process. Beyond the technology and business competencies required within any innovation process, this paper focuses on possible complementary skills linked with the plurality of structures involved. The aim is to elaborate a competence’s list of reference dedicated to people piloting open innovation, and, to test this referential through new learning modules. The first step of the research consists in testing the hypothesis of the existence of specific open innovation management abilities. Based on a literature review and considering the work of the standard organization) in the field of innovation management (ISO/TC279), the research focuses on sensing practices that are typical of open innovation dynamics. These practices are then linked with a set of competences (knowledge and know how) thanks experts and company members interviews and according to a bibliographic analysis. Hence a competence referential is proposed for open innovation managers. In a second step, this referential has been valorized to design a new pedagogical module added to the syllabus of the Ecole Nationale Supérieure en Génie des Systèmes et de l’Innovation (ENSGSI) a French engineering school dedicated to innovation and management of technology. The paper gives the results of a two years’ experience about open innovation learning with students at final engineering level (master degree). The module uses the pedagogical concept of formative assessment: five evaluation sequences are integrated to the module. Each associating the students themselves, professors and employees of companies applying open innovation strategies. This transverse assessment is discussed all along the module by these three groups of people involved in order to get a continuous feedback. The outcomes of this evaluation process are detailed and analysed in constructivist terms: do the module gives students new abilities and are the competencies adapted to the launching phase of an open innovation process? In conclusion, the hypothesis of specific abilities relating to open innovation is validated. But the generic status of each of the competencies seems questionable. The wide range of openness situations suggests a necessary contextualization when identifying the pertinent targeted competencies of open innovation managers.",Brunelle M.; Manon E.; Vincent B.,Conference Proceeding,"Managing Technology for Inclusive and Sustainable Growth - 28th International Conference for the International Association of Management of Technology, IAMOT 2019",2019-01-01,Université de Lorraine,Competencies ;  Learning ;  Open Innovation ;  Partnership
Designing business models for augmented reality,"Almost all sectors of the manufacturing industry are affected by a shift in which the traditional product portfolio is being replaced by highly integrated product service systems. This shift–also referred to as “servitization in manufacturing”–is accelerated by innovation potentials that arise from the progress of digitally enabled technologies. A technology with a considerable potential for the digital refinement of the product service business is Augmented Reality (AR). It enables real-world environments to be enriched with additional virtual content. For example, repair instructions can be visualized as a 3D animation superimposed on a physical machine, enabling service technicians to carry out complex tasks more time and cost efficiently. However, the integration of AR into the product service portfolio requires adjustments to the business model: (1) Companies have to identify promising use cases for AR that create value for the customer, thereby defining the value proposition of the business model. (2) The identified use cases need to be translated into products and services, integrated into the existing product service portfolio. (3) Promising business models have to be designed, taking into account the technology-specific challenges posed by AR (e.g. ensuring user acceptance, finding revenue models to cover the investment costs for AR devices). Despite the large variety of potential AR applications, business models successfully exploiting AR are still the exception, indicating that the development of sustainable business models is a significant challenge. With this in mind, in this paper, we present an approach for designing business models for AR. The approach consists of a procedure model providing step-by-step instructions on how to develop business models for AR and additional tools (e.g. catalogue with AR use cases, business model cards), that help to tackle the technology-specific challenges caused by AR. It combines a methodical procedure with technology-specific solution knowledge, allowing companies to utilize the benefits of AR for their product service business. The approach is described using an industrial use case from the joint research project “AcRoSS – Instruments for the Implementation of AR-based Product Service Systems” in which the use of AR is analysed for supporting repair processes in the machine and plant engineering industry.",Röltgen D.; Wortmann F.; Grote E.; Dumitrescu R.,Conference Proceeding,"Managing Technology for Inclusive and Sustainable Growth - 28th International Conference for the International Association of Management of Technology, IAMOT 2019",2019-01-01,Fraunhofer Institute for Mechatronic Systems Design,Augmented Reality ;  Business Model ;  Product Service System ;  Servitization
Industrial competitiveness of solar firms from India: Exploring role of technology management and policy,"India has remarkable achievements in innovation through revolutions such as green, white, mobile and solar. With India leading international partnerships like the International Solar Alliance and targeting an installation of 100 GW of solar power by 2022 under the National Solar Mission, it has set itself on a mission to attain global leadership position in solar energy. However, the mission is compounding the vexing problems such as ‘less sustainable trade deficits’ and ‘slow break-out for competitiveness’. At this juncture, the external competition and slow break-out in internal capabilities (including MoT capabilities) across its solar value chain have added to the burgeoning trade deficit of India. The Economic Survey 2018 identified the renewable energy sector as Champion Sector in Make in India 2.0 which has brought a renewed focus on the manufacturing capabilities of firms of Indian origin (FIOs) in the renewable sector. In this light, this paper explores the twin impact of the policy and technology management to improve the competitiveness of solar FIOs. The study begins with identification of drivers of competitive advantage in the Solar Photovoltaic (SPV) industry and an assessment of the gaps in the government policies. In the next stage, the study focuses on identification of constraints across the solar value chain, especially gaps in Management of Technology (MoT), which have led to decrease in competitiveness of FIOs. Based on the findings, a MoT strategy is devised with an objective to build capabilities and scale-up domestic SPV manufacturers. For this we adopted a mixed-method approach as a research methodology, focusing both on quantitative and qualitative analysis. This is followed by a systematic ‘problem structuring’ method to identify the root cause of low industrial competitiveness among Solar FIOs. The study also explores, which FIOs have resources to sustain competitiveness in solar, as China has done with firms such as Yingli, Jinko Solar, Trina Solar through benchmarking analysis. Our study is verified and supported by experiential insights derived through primary research and personal interviews of private and public policy experts in the solar domain. The paper contributes towards building practical knowledge about gaps in ‘strategy of firms’ and ‘policies of governments’ that hinder the ‘rapid turnaround’ of capable solar FIOs to start competing internationally on relevant parts of ‘solar industry value system’. This is also an exercise of learning lessons from the leaders, to propel India into envisioned leadership position in solar manufacturing.",Chachondia S.; Manthri P.; Momaya K.,Conference Proceeding,"Managing Technology for Inclusive and Sustainable Growth - 28th International Conference for the International Association of Management of Technology, IAMOT 2019",2019-01-01,Shailesh J.

Risk management of emerging biotechnologies,"The World Economic Forum (WEF) has pointed the dual use dilemma of biotechnology innovations through a Global Risks Report and discussed the risk reduction and opportunity capture of biotechnology in relation to the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). Recent emerging biotechnologies, such as synthetic biology, gene editing and nano-biotechnology, as well as open source software and hardware, are concerned about the ease and sophistication of life manipulation and generation at low cost. These explosive synthetic biology and gene editing developments are also concerned with the possibility of dual use with biological weapons, which may be intentional or unintentional. The technological innovation of gene synthesis is rapidly advancing the synthetic biology that can dramatically reduce the costs and increase the accuracy and enable genome synthesis. Synthetic biology can revolutionize the function of living organisms by engineering and synthesizing genes as parts with one unit. The entire genome of the microbial organism was synthesized from small pieces, reaching the level at which other microorganisms were transferred and operated. Synthetic biology can be used to produce microorganisms that produce biofuels, medicines, or organic substances. On the other hand, the possibility of creating new pathogens with various risk characteristics as well as gain of function is increased for dual use. The research objective is to suggest the policy directions for risk management of emerging biotechnologies, including synthetic biology and gene editing and so on. The approach taken in this paper combined with qualitative and quantitative analysis methods, such as bibliographic analysis, peer reviews and in-depth interviews. We analyzed the policy formation, policy implementation and policy coordination for risk management on emerging biotechnologies and suggested science and technology-based policy directions to increase resilience to risk management in these areas. We hope this paper has been helpful to understand and overcome the risks of emerging biotechnologies.",Han S.,Conference Proceeding,"Managing Technology for Inclusive and Sustainable Growth - 28th International Conference for the International Association of Management of Technology, IAMOT 2019",2019-01-01,Korea Institute of S&T Evaluation and Planning,Biosecurity ;  Biotechnology Innovation ;  Dual use ;  Science ;  Synthetic Biology ;  Technology Policy
Crowdsourcing aimed at value innovation,"We aim to relate the theories of the blue ocean [1] and the wisdom of the crowds to answer the research question, ""Can crowdsourcing contribute to the generation of innovation of value?"" For this purpose, we searched the literature and the Internet for information on the four businesses (iStockphoto, Web Junk 20, InnoCentive, and Amazon Mechanical Turk [AMT]) used by Howe [2] to propose the term crowdsourcing. For each business, we identified the characteristics that would allow us to classify it as crowdsourcing at the present time. In this first analysis, we concluded that currently, Web Junk 20 would not be classified as crowdsourcing. In the second analysis, we looked for the four businesses' attributes that were capable of generating innovation of value. We concluded that iStockphoto, InnoCentive, and AMT had common features that generated value innovation and could be grouped into the reduce, eliminate, create, and elevate matrix, according to the blue ocean.",Martins T.; Zambalde A.; de Souza Bermejo P.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,2019-01-01,Universidade de Brasília;University of Lavras,
Performance-based requirements in design-build contracting for highway construction and maintenance,"Design-build contracts with performance-based specifications are believed to raise productivity and the innovation rate. However, performance-based requirements used in specifications for highway and bridge contracts may suffer from being too detailed or too difficult to verify. A Swedish research project has been devoted to this issue. The aims were (i) to develop a definition of performance-based requirements and (ii) to evaluate performance-based requirements used in Swedish design-build contracts. The project consisted of three parts: (i) literature survey, (ii) investigation of current documents produced and used by the Swedish Transport Administration for design-build contracts, and (iii) case studies of six design-build contracts with performance-based requirements, including an analysis of specification documents and interviews with both client and contractor project managers. Current performance-based specifications show different degrees of detail. Measurable requirements are more frequently used on roads, and in particular on road surfaces, than on bridges. Further development is needed to promote technical innovations. Less detailed specifications and a shift to design-build-operate contracts with prolonged maintenance responsibility would also encourage the choice of more durable and long-lasting (=sustainable) solutions. The emphasis on Life Cycle Cost (LCC) in the reformulated contract award criteria in the EU public procurement directive might be insufficient to strengthen the competitive power of concrete pavements as compared to asphalt pavements, unless specifications are supported by Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) and the choice of contract type is reconsidered.",Silfwerbrand J.; Bröchner J.,Conference Proceeding,"FIB 2018 - Proceedings for the 2018 fib Congress: Better, Smarter, Stronger",2019-01-01,The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH);Chalmers University of Technology,Design-build contracting ;  Highway construction ;  Maintenance ;  Performance-based requirements

"Nanobiotechnology for agricultural productivity, food security and environmental sustainability","Achieving sustainable development is one of the key challenges at present and also foremost priority to attain food security for the increasing population. Enormous dependency on agrochemicals has devastated net crop yield and has caused irreparable damage to our ecosystem. A novel and environmentally benign technology that can aid in improved yield and crop protection is a need of hour. Nanobiotechnology offers possible solutions to several key constraints of agricultural production systems, which is evident from the recent research developments. Nanomaterials are often considered to be ‘smart delivery systems’ and exhibit unique and varied functions; therefore, nanoparticle-mediated plant genetic engineering, nanofertilizers, nanopesticides and nanosensors find potential applications in agricultural systems, which could substantially contribute to sustainable agriculture. However, continuous efforts are underway to understand their economic and environment feasibility for wide usage. In this chapter, novel developments and innovations in the nanobiotechnology with relevance to agricultural productivity, food security and environmental sustainability have been broadly outlined.",Sangeetha J.; Mundaragi A.; Thangadurai D.; Maxim S.; Pandhari R.; Alabhai J.,Book,Nanotechnology for Agriculture: Crop Production &amp; Protection,2019-01-01,Davangere University;Central University of Kerala;Karnatak University Dharwad,Agricultural productivity ;  Food security ;  Nanofertilizer ;  Nanomaterials ;  Nanopesticides ;  Nanosensors ;  Nanotechnology ;  Sustainable development

Cyclic bearing capacity model test of suction multi-bucket foundation of offshore wind turbine,"The suction bucket foundation will gradually become one of the basic forms of offshore wind turbines in the future because of its advantages of simple installation, high anti-overturning bearing capacity, material saving and reusability. The current research mainly focuses on the stability analysis of single bucket foundations, and there is little research on the inter-bucket effect and bearing characteristics of multi-bucket foundations. In view of the strength characteristics of the offshore wind turbine foundation, the bearing capacity of horizontal cyclic load is particularly important for the stability of bucket foundation. In this paper, the suction four-bucket foundation was subjected to static bearing capacity model test and series of multi-point cyclic load model experiments under horizontal load, and the foundation failure modes and joint action mechanism of the four-bucket foundation structure on the saturated sand foundation are explored. The innovation of this paper is to carry out model test research on the suction four-bucket wind power foundation, analyze the interaction mechanism and failure mode between the buckets, and explore the influence of multi-point cyclic load on the bearing capacity. So far, few similar studies have been conducted.",Wu J.; Yang Y.; Liu S.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference,2019-01-01,Ocean University of China,Bearing capacity ;  Model test ;  Multi-bucket foundation ;  Multi-point cyclic load ;  Offshore wind power
Educate for technological innovation,"At Polytechnics design & engineering students are taught about state-of-the-art technical knowledge. Students become qualified engineers and learn to innovate artifacts related to their domain. Not taught is how to develop new engineering knowledge within a multidisciplinary context of stakeholders, companies and regulations. In short, students don't learn to innovate technology. What is taught today is the result of a technological innovation of yesterday. This is not sufficient for industry to innovatively deal with society's grand challenges. The paper describes a project that aims to educate all TU Delft graduate students in the verb of innovating technology, that is, the development of new technologies from inventions in the labs to full-fledged application in business. Such along three dimensions: technical, human and business. The educational portfolio consists of three modules in line with growth along Bloom's taxonomy and online materials on theoretical backbones. All modules apply the notion of technological innovation journeys (Tijo's).

External technology searching methods - A literature review,"This paper provides a preliminary assessment of the literature available in the field of External Technology Searching. Many methods exist to enable companies to take advantage of new technologies and apply them to achieve a competitive advantage. This literature review focuses on reducing complexity and providing clarity related to the numerous different terms and methodologies used throughout the literature. The main methods found in the literature include: Technology Foresight, Technology Forecasting, Technology Intelligence, and Technology Scouting. However, many additional terms have also been used to describe similar strategies, leading to inconsistency in the use of the terms, resulting in confusion and missed opportunities to innovate for those trying to navigate the field.

The hidden feat behind development cost escalation - How engineering design enables functional expansion in the aerospace industry,"The aerospace industry experiences a considerable growth in product development costs. Many research works aim at identifying evolution laws characterizing this large-scale phenomenon and at developing design strategies which could help mitigate it. This paper aims to clarify the evolution dynamics governing this phenomenon by studying how the products delivered by these costly projects evolve with time. Increasing complexity is often held responsible for surging costs. If complexity is generally defined as the price to be paid for improving product functionalities, it is rarely specified whether the improvement affects existing functionalities or involves new ones. We aim to identify the patterns of cost growth which can be associated with phenomena of existing functionalities upgrade and new functionalities introduction, and to identify the associated design capabilities that designers need to deploy in order to keep product change and cost growth under control. To that end, we introduce a model which generates curves, each of which featuring a trend of cost growth, specific to a scenario of product evolution and being interpretable as a signature of a strategy used by designers.",Gilain A.; Le Masson P.; Weil B.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the Design Society: International Conference on Engineering Design,2019-01-01,Mines Paris - PSL,Design costing ;  Functional expansion ;  Functional modelling ;  Innovation ;  Product architecture
Perspectives on innovation: The role of engineering design,"The aim of the paper is to foster a discussion in the engineering design community about its understanding of the innovation phenomena and the unique contribution that comes from engineering design. The paper reports on the dialouge originating from a series of workshops with participants from different backgrounds in engineering design, systems engineering, industrial design psychology and business. Definitions of innovation are revisited as used in business, management and engineering design contexts. The role of innovation is then discussed related to product development from (i) the management perspective, (ii) a systems architecture perspective and (iii) in relation to sustainable development as one driver of innovation. It is argued that engineering design has a central role in how to realise the novelty aspect of innovation and often plays a critical role in maturing these into the valuable products, and there is a need to articulate the role of engineering design in innovation to better resonate with the business and management research.",Isaksson O.; Eckert C.; Borgue O.; Hallstedt S.; Hein A.; Gericke K.; Panarotto M.; Reich Y.; Öhrwall Rönnbäck A.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the Design Society: International Conference on Engineering Design,2019-01-01,Université Paris-Saclay;University of Luxembourg;Blekinge Tekniska Högskola;Luleå University of Technology;Tel Aviv University;Chalmers University of Technology;Open University,Design engineering ;  Design management ;  Design process ;  Innovation
Effective innovation implementation of mechatronic product-service systems considering socio-technical aspects,"It is estimated that about half of all innovations, such as innovations in mechatronic product-service systems (PSS), fail to deliver the expected benefits to the adopting organization. Different studies point out that one of the main reasons for this is an ineffective implementation process. In this paper, we argue that, apart from several organizational challenges, insufficient integration of technical and social aspects is one of the reasons for ineffective innovation implementation in the environment of mechatronic PSS. In order to remedy this weakness, this paper builds on the work of interdisciplinary research collaboration. Experts from technical, socio-technical, and management fields integrate their work within a conceptual innovation implementation management system (IIMS). This IIMS is capable of capturing various methods and models that foster the socio-technical integration in mechatronic PSS. The approach is assessed in a lab-scale demonstration case that is representative of industrial environments. The presented approach supports an effective innovation implementation process, while the IIMS facilitates individual alignments for future practitioners.",Koltun G.; Romero Viturro C.; Buchholz J.; Wissel J.; Zaggl M.; Ocker F.; Vogel-Heuser B.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the Design Society: International Conference on Engineering Design,2019-01-01,Universidade de Vigo;Technische Universität München,Design engineering ;  Innovation Implementation ;  Mechatronics ;  Product-Service Systems (PSS) ;  Socio-technial Innovation Design
Innovative design within tradition - Injecting topos structures in C-K theory to model culinary creation heritage,"In ""Grande cuisine” creation and tradition co-evolve in a rich number of ways. Great chefs still use recipes from the 19th century and may also reinvent gastronomy itself. The creation heritage of culinary Art is the paradoxical capacity to both “respect” tradition and “break” its rules. Building on C-K theory, we show that such creative heritage needs multiple and independent layers of knowledge that ""speak"" of basic fixed objects. These properties correspond to general mathematical structures that we find in Topos theory. Thus, C-K/Topos predicts creative design strategies that can respect tradition in different ways. It also proves a form of ""innovation within tradition"" - ""sheafification"" in Topos words- that is not a compromise and builds on tradition itself. These findings fit with the lessons of great books of gastronomy. C-K/Topos has a wide scope of validity: it applies to any innovative design that needs preserving systemic structures, like engineering systems or social and environmental systems. CK/Topos models with a high generality how local and radical innovation can warrant systems incremental change. C-K/Topos will have implications for teaching and research.",Hatchuel A.; Le Masson P.; Weil B.; Carvajal-Perez D.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the Design Society: International Conference on Engineering Design,2019-01-01,Mines Paris - PSL,Creation heritage ;  Design theory ;  Innovation ;  Knowledge management ;  Tradition
A study of a compact high-efficiency zero-emission power plant with oxy-fuel combustion,"This paper discusses the application of global trends in gas cycles technology using oxy-fuel combustion. This is followed by a demonstration of a design solution for a new cycle with two enhanced energy-converting devices, namely a wet combustion chamber and a spray-ejector condenser. The proposed gas and steam cycle unit is contained within a single turbine, whose benefits combine those offered by gas turbines (high inlet temperatures) and steam turbines (full expansion into a vacuum). The efficiency of the oxy-fuel combustion system with carbon dioxide capture was determined based on thermodynamic analyses carried out using in-house codes (COM-GAS). The motivation behind this research paper was provided by calls for diversification in the power generation industry in Poland as well as the need for new solutions in power plants, including compact ones. Compactness can be achieved when the plant is rid of its largest components such as the heat recovery steam generator and the conventional steam condenser. For this, it would be necessary to design non-standard cutting-edge devices, but the counterbalancing pay-off would be in their size, reduced to the point where power plants, in which they are installed, will be able to adequately address the needs of urban users and cater for heat production demand. The concept under consideration is based on the use of shale gas deposits in the place of extraction in a compact, zero-emission gas-steam turbine power system. In our case power plant compactness is achieved by using two new devices, namely: 1) a wet combustion chamber (with oxy-combustion and combustion chamber walls cooling by thermal transpiration); 2) a condenser spray-ejector (using a bulk condensation of vapor-gas). The main aim of the spray-ejector condenser is simultaneously condensing steam and compressing CO2 from the condensation pressure to about 1 bar. Hence, the most important innovation of this steam-gas cycle emerges as the enhanced condensation, which is based on the nano-injection of cold water and a jet-powered compression of CO2 performed in the spray-ejector condenser.",Ziółkowski P.; Badur J.,Conference Proceeding,"ECOS 2019 - Proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems",2019-01-01,"Polskiej Akademii Nauk, Instytut Maszyn Przepływowych im.

Natural disaster-Environmental health preparedness,"This article will summarize a short, simple and comprehensive description of natural disaster preparedness and response, focusing on: • What they are in terms of qualitative and quantitative perspectives; • How they can be addressed in terms of prevention and management; • Innovations that may be piloted, evaluated, adopted, and diffused if appropriate. Public health agencies have a responsibility to prevent, prepare, and respond to incidents causing widespread population exposure to extreme events including disasters. Progress in disaster risk reduction (DRR) research has shown that it is often not the hazard that determines a disaster, but the vulnerability, exposure, and ability of the population to anticipate, respond to, and recover from its effects. When faced with an environmental health disaster, the following must be taken into account: - Preparedness is vital in addition to response; - The main aim must be prevention of disasters in the first place (i.e., DRR); - There are a range of available and innovative tools that can be used by the public health practitioners and researchers in this field; and - Effective prevention, preparedness, and response efforts require interdisciplinary collaborations, such as public health, healthcare, science, engineering, law, architecture, economy, journalism, sociology, psychology, and the arts.",Lauriola P.; Leonardi G.; Righi E.; Bayleyegn T.; Schnall A.; Malilay J.; Louca S.; Behbod B.,Book,Encyclopedia of Environmental Health,2019-01-01,Public Health Wales;Public Health England;University of Nicosia;Cardiff University School of Medicine;Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche;National Center for Environmental Health;Università degli Studi di Modena e Reggio Emilia,Blockchain ;  CASPER ;  Cluster sampling ;  Disaster ;  Environmental health ;  Environmental health public tracking ;  Epidemiology ;  Health register ;  Preparedness ;  Rapid needs assessment ;  Response ;  Surveillance
A project based learning tool for industry 4.0 manufacturing engineering education,"Project based learning (PBL) is an educational technique where learners gain subject knowledge and learn by investigating and responding while busy doing a project or challenge. It implies learner's active involvement in a real world problem where s/he can apply, investigate, respond, and reapply the theoretical knowledge to find appropriate solutions. This paper presents some significant insights about a teaching innovation project conducted on project based learning for better understanding the manufacturing engineering module contents. First project based learning (PBL) is introduced which is followed by some review of past research work conducted on PBL, then formulation of a project problem for the students of manufacturing engineering is discussed and it ends with the analysis of the students response on the effectiveness of PBL for them to understand and learn the module contents. A majority of the students realized the effectiveness of PBL technique, and accepted better understanding of the manufacturing processes and learning enhancement. It is worth mentioning that the University of Johannesburg is a forerunner institution globally to implement, follow and encourage the fourth industrial revolution activities in teaching and research.

Development of an innovative multi-performance system for LWS structures,"Nowadays the key topics of the construction sector are safety and eco-efficiency. In the last decades, the Lightweight Steel (LWS) systems made of Cold Formed Steel (CFS) profiles have shown high structural and environmental performances, joining perfectly the new trend. In this perspective, the University of Naples “Federico II”, in cooperation with Lamieredil S.p.A. Company, has recently started a new research project. The main goal of the project is the development of a new solution with high seismic and environmental performances. From the structural point of view, the innovation consists in a CFS profile wall, equipped with pre-tensioned Ultra High Strength (UHS) steel braces, which are able to limit global displacement of structure and to dissipate seismic energy by its yielding. The effectiveness of the wall system will be proved through several tests carried out at Lab of the Department of Structures for Engineering and Architecture. The experimental activity will include tests on materials and assemblies, monotonic and cyclic tests on full-scale components and shake-table tests on a building mock-up. From the environmental point of view, more appropriate materials for the envelope will be selected and production and erection processes of the system will be analysed, in order to obtain higher acoustic and thermal performances and reduction of waste. As a conclusion, a prototype building will be erected, tested and monitored on the company property. The paper summarizes the research project in detail, the experimental program and the design of the innovative system and prototype.",Campiche A.,Conference Proceeding,"Stability and Ductility of Steel Structures - Proceedings of the International Colloquia on Stability and Ductility of Steel Structures, 2019",2019-01-01,Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II,
The design and development of a 100 km two-stage electromechanical parachute recovery system,"Recovery systems for amateur and university-class rocket projects are notoriously unreliable and tend to be adhoc systems without much engineering analysis. This paper demonstrates the design, development, and testing of an electromechanical recovery system for a 100km capable university-class amateur rocket. Traditional recovery concepts such as pyrotechnics and gas cartridges were studied, as well as recent innovations such as shape memory alloy wire, in an effort to create a repeatable, robust, and testable high-altitude rocket recovery system. This paper discusses the initial research, engineering analysis, design decisions, prototype development, and validation testing of the system. Validation testing includes reliability metrics gathered from extensive ground testing, a complete system test deployed from a helicopter, and finally the system's use on a roughly half-scale rocket.",House M.; Hurley A.; Goodenough G.; Stickrod N.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2019-01-01,,
The 2019 analog Mars mission season at the Desert Mars analog Ramon Station,"With NASA's announcement in 2019 of going back to the moon with the Artemis program, and the plan of building a Moon base in 2028 as a milestone for Mars colonization, there is an urgent need in providing methods to sustain a human crew on the Moon and Mars for substantially long periods. The Beresheet spacecraft hard landing on the Moon, April 2019, has inspired the Israeli public, children and adults alike, and the Desert Mars Analog Ramon Station (D-MARS) non profit organization was established during Beresheet developmental stages. It is dedicated for establishing an international planetary analog research center in the Negev desert, Israel. D-MARS aims to promote space-related education, science and technological innovation via space simulation or analog mission infrastructure. The Ramon Crater in the Negev desert was chosen for its Mars-like geomorphology and geology, isolation and hyper arid climate conditions allowing for a Mars simulated environment. The D-MARS habitat is a scalable deployed portable structure. It can support six analog astronauts (“Ramonauts”) living in isolation during few weeks of an analog mission. The habitat has a science lab that includes a biological safety cabinet and additional equipment to perform geo-biological experiments internally, a single hydroponic tray, a common room, six wood encased sleeping pods, kitchenette, a small restroom. D-MARS members have performed Mars analog missions during 2018-2019. During the 2019 field campaign (February - March 2019), several analog Mars missions were performed: An 11-day main analog mission; a three-day”Landing on Mars” simulation mission to prepare and put into operation the infrastructure and technological equipment, simulating a crew in a landing phase on Mars; a two-day medical analog mission that included several medical emergency simulated events; a dedicated high school student group performed a three-day analog missions as part of the Young Astronaut Academy (YAA). The YAA program promotes STEM and the love of space and science. During all missions, all simulated extravehicular activities (EVAs) were done in a dedicated sim spacesuit, when operating outside of the habitat. The Ramonauts were in fairly complete isolation and communicated only with Mission Support Center (MSC), via text/image, in a dedicated webserver, with a 10-minute delay, each way. During the main 11-day mission various scientific experiments included soil analysis, environmental microorganisms metagenomics, isolation and characterization, rover utilization for external mapping and situational exploration, various psychological analyses of crew's wellness and more.

Building foundations for international collaboration through educational outreach initiatives,"As human space exploration pursues journeying to the Moon and Mars, international and intercultural collaboration is key for the success of such ambitious goals. Since 2014, NASA's Johnson Space Center (JSC) Hispanic Employee Resource Group (HERG) has established relationships and participated in outreach events with emerging space organizations in Latin America with educational and public outreach as a common goal. Such efforts align with strategic goals to empower the next generation of innovators and explorers and to champion the development of space exploration capabilities. This paper discusses the partnerships developed to introduce Spanish speaking populations to science, space technology, aeronautics, research and development through television, webcasts and social media. The authors share accomplishments, challenges, and lessons learned to build foundations for international collaboration to ignite research and innovation and propel human space exploration. The methodology makes use of Space Act Agreements to leverage existing outreach materials and programs and translate the content into Spanish for the benefit of students, educational organizations and the public in general. The plan is to apply the same model in other regions and countries to create a Latin American network of language translation and diffusion of science and space technology content targeting emerging space sectors. This model could be used to reach out to other international communities to provide cultural and educational outreach for space exploration and research.",Fontanot C.; López E.; López J.; Olvera A.; Castro G.; Viñas M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2019-01-01,National Aeronautics and Space Administration;NASA Johnson Space Center;Dirección General de Televisión Educativa (DGTVE);Agencia Espacial Mexicana (AEM),Cultural Outreach ;  Engineering ;  Hispanic ;  International Collaboration ;  Math (STEM) ;  Science ;  Space Act Agreement ;  Spanish Language ;  Technology

Additive manufacturing in low earth orbit within a 1u cube satellite,"Three-Dimensional printing in space is one of the most promising technologies advancing current capabilities for on-orbit space manufacturing and assembly. Additive Manufacturing(AM) contributes the reduction the cost of per kilogram and number of launches, while facilitating colonization and deep space exploration. The current state of the art indicates advancing efforts inside the International Space Station (ISS). However, the ISS is a controlled environment, and to the best of our knowledge, no spacecraft or satellite has performed additive manufacturing tasks in the extreme environment of outer space. In this work, a 1U small satellite, nicknamed Orbital Factory 2 (OF-2) will perform a technological demonstration featuring a 1-DOF gantry table mechanism that will deposit conductive ink, repairing a simulated solar cell. Leveraging the world-class additive manufacturing capabilities of the W.M. Keck Center for 3D Innovation at UTEP, a number of payload parts in OF-2 have been manufactured using DSM Somos® ProtoTherm™ and ULTEM™ 9085. As a secondary payload, OF-2 includes an experimental, additively manufactured S-band patch antenna designed and built by Lockheed Martin Space Systems (LMS). OF-2 will be launched on the Northrop Grumman Antares rocket scheduled for November 6, 2019 and deployed from the CRS2 NG-12 (Cygnus) spacecraft February 2020.",Quintana J.; Flores A.; Khan A.; Choudhuri A.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2019-01-01,The University of Texas at El Paso,
Hosted payload design and systems engineering for the UN-SNC DrEam Chaser mission collaboratively developed by international academia and industry,"As part of a collaboration between the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs and Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), hosted payload spaceflight opportunities are made available in particular to developing and emerging countries. Thus, the University of Cape Town, the University of Stuttgart, Airbus Defence and Space (DS) GmbH Germany and additional partners collaborate on a hosted payload system to be flown as an external payload on-board of the SNC's Dream Chaser spacecraft. This payload aims to meet Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations (UN) in the field of Quality Education, Industry, Innovation and Partnerships by fostering international education and collaboration. This is realized by conducting research in remote sensing, in-situ measurement investigations and technology demonstration. The scientific objectives are diverse and include experiments i) to determine and to record sprite-type lightning phenomena from space, ii) to verify the functional efficiency of a sub-scaled intake demonstrator for Atmosphere Breathing Electric Propulsion, iii) to establish a sensor system for measuring the total particle flux density in the Thermosphere and iv) to perform and to evaluate cosmic dust measurements of an impact ionization dust detector in low Earth orbit. Within this framework, the avionics core based on the Flexible LEO Platform 2 on-board computer architecture developed by Airbus DS Germany is to be verified for hosted payload systems. Special demands on space systems engineering is required due to specific requirements of the multiple subsystems in order to guarantee the functionality of the system itself and to enable promising research conditions. A detailed preliminary engineering design solution of the payload is derived from an initial mission analysis and mission definition by applying the methods of a space systems engineering approach. This comprises the elaboration of mission objectives; the identification, compilation and assessment of requirements and constraints; a feasibility study; and a first design iteration of all scientific experiments. In addition, an overall payload consideration regarding electrical interfaces, software sequences, power consumption, data rates and potentially occurring risks has been performed. The mission aims to strengthen international collaboration and to foster education and research. In this paper, the space systems engineering process of this phase 0 study is outlined including relevant methods and solutions. Subsequently, the preliminary design of the collaborative hosted payload is presented.",Hertel V.; Laufer R.; Herdrich G.; Srama R.; Eickhoff J.; Martinez P.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2019-01-01,Airbus Defence and Space;Universität Stuttgart;Baylor University;University of Cape Town;Secure World Foundation,Dream Chaser ;  Hosted Payload ;  Sierra Nevada Corporation ;  Sustainable Development Goals ;  Systems Engineering ;  United Nations

Fostering creativity and innovation within science and technology teams,"The Defence Science and Technology (DST) Group is a medium-sized Australian Government research organisation, performing science and technology (S&T) research for Australian Defence and National Security across a wide range of domains including Space. Creative solutions are required to ensure the ADF is at the forefront of technology to ensure the safety and security of Australia and its national interests. In Space research, as in many other S&T fields, the need for individuals and teams to tap into creative processes to produce innovative solutions and long-term visions is essential. However, there are many barriers that hinder the creative process, particularly when in a team environment or in larger organisations with entrenched culture and business practices. Consequently, a qualitative preliminary investigation was performed at DST, to better understand how creativity is perceived to apply to its science and engineering teams and the key factors and activities at team and organisational levels that could be addressed to foster creativity. These key factors and activities are determined from the views of a limited selection of middle-senior level employees, team-leaders and management, and are intended to inform further studies and efforts at DST and other research organisations. The preliminary study utilised: review of literature, interviews with staff, and creativity audit questionnaires. The responses showed that participants see creativity as an intrinsic part of their work in a research organisation; however, highly creative ideas are not always proposed due to local and organisational barriers. According to the limited number of participants, and consistent with literature, creativity is hindered when where there is pressure to meet the expectations of stakeholders within a tight timeframe, and when there are high levels of administration and risk avoidance. Additionally, cultural and personal factors can hinder creativity such as the fear of being judged or ridiculed for proposing ideas and the fear of failure. The participants identified that the primary requirements for creativity in teams was found to be 'having the personal freedom to be creative (this includes time and supervisory support)', and 'ensuring the correct, safe and healthy group dynamics'. This paper discusses the findings of the preliminary study including the key focus areas for increasing creativity in teams as viewed by a limited selection of mid-senior level staff and management at DST. A series of recommendations is also suggested, which may be utilised to support and foster creativity within the research organisation.",Forrester C.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2019-01-01,Defence Science and Technology Group,
"The new global governance in the aerospace industry: New technological capabilities in Brazil, China and Canada","The aerospace industry has two industrial subsectors: Aeronautics and Space. The leading countries in this global value chain (GVC) present a holistic perception of this indissoluble binomial. However, there are learner countries which have been integrated in an unprecedented way into Aeronautics. Therefore, this paradigm break is the reason why this investigation was conducted. The “technological capability” concept builds an architecture that fully supports the relation between technological and governance development in Politics, Commerce and Society. Therefore, on this research, a theoretical approach of Science and Technology in the field of Social Sciences and International Relations was developed with the purpose of generating an adequate analysis framework based on the Governance Theory, Open Innovation and Technological Capabilities literature. This framework served to analyze three case studies, such as Brazil, Canada and China. As intermediate industrial leaders in the manufacture of regional aircraft, despite having a different technological trajectory, their technical capabilities impacted on the GVC, thus generating a new governance in local institutions and international organizations. In these three cases, not only favorable conditions have emerged, but also, they faced a poor management regarding public policies. As a result, it was found that this atmosphere is called as a National Innovation System (NIS) and it is a methodological turning point to analyze the technological transfer, adoption and assimilation in developing countries, which could lead to finished products for the space sector. In the three case studies, the main interest was a military, political and industrial integration. However, considering the Industry 4.0 and a global technological convergence, it is concluded that the aerospace industry has become a multicausal and multisectoral phenomenon when integrating new advanced functionalities such as Blockchain, Big Data, Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Analytics. This technological enablement has led to industry good practices in Aeronautics regarding discrete manufacturing and B2B2C services; as for the space sector concerning Remote Sensing for disaster management, public health, communications and climate change studies. All the previous based on an open innovation economy, which is nourished not only by an inter-business dynamic, but also by external data sources. Now the challenges of this reformulation will revolve around integration, global standards, systems interoperability and data security (GDPR). The NIS will then have to be able to manage these factors to achieve both commercial competitiveness and the guarantee of a social benefit.",Ramírez S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2019-01-01,Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México,Brazil ;  Canada ;  China ;  Governance ;  Open innovation ;  Technological capabilities
Artificial intelligence as behavioural countermeasure,"The requirements of space medical technology and devices build on the level of care (from 1 to 5), which are based on the duration of the mission and its objectives. For example, Lunar and planetary surface crewed missions have a level of care equal to 4, as long-term missions lasting hundreds of days, like one of the most dangerous and complex scenarios of medical assistance and treatment. In contrast to specialised medical devices, future medical systems are expected to be used in diagnosis and treatment accounting of data from different domains (as emotions and environmental conditions). These systems shall actively assist the crew in decision making and in the management of their health and safety. Intelligent inflight medical systems are thought to be the most appropriate solution for integrating multidomain data. However, the use of AI in aerospace medicine may be questionable as AI builds on large data about known medical conditions, while there is little data about long-term missions in space and only a reference population, the astronaut population. Commercial crewed and space tourists might have inferior physical and mental performance than current formal astronauts. Therefore, astronaut-based AI might not be directly applicable to commercial astronauts, as this is population is exposed to a higher risk undergoing medical conditions in space. There is a need for addressing the use of AI from the phase-design to guarantee integration of AI-types when space flights will be opened to commercial astronauts. Thus, the innovation shall be addressed to a different end-user, which, in turn, may lead to a revision of standards and safety requirements. This work presents the development of an in-flight AI medical system built by design for allowing its application to both formal and commercial astronauts. The purpose of this project aims at establishing an autonomous bioelectric treatment for Terrestrial and in-flight brain medical care for counteracting hazards of human behavioural and mental health. Here, AI builds on multiple databases which include brain mapping of multi-domain data for the identification and recognition of functional and structural alterations of the brain at multiscale. The platform aims at controlling setting parameters of transcranial brain stimulation, as the neuromodulation technique through which a non-invasive painless treatment can be provided. The significance of this work is in its translational potential and applicability to both Terrestrial and space medicine.",Cinelli I.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2019-01-01,Aerospace Medical Association,Artificial intelligence ;  Neuromodulation ;  Space medical capabilities ;  TDCS
Interdisciplinary space lab: Undergraduate curriculum innovation utilising astronaut health and wellbeing requirements for long duration space missions (LDMs),"This paper presents innovative curriculum for an Australian undergraduate industrial design program “Interdisciplinary Space Lab” that focuses on discovery and experiential learning in planning for future complex work in dynamic practice environments through concept development, iterative prototyping processes, and collaborative multiple discipline viewpoints. Universities seek to introduce undergraduate students to the importance of entering interdisciplinary practice environments despite there being limited information on how to proceed. A long duration mission (LDM) project based learning 'design for space' studio focusing on astronaut health and wellbeing has been developed for students who have completed 1.5 years of university study in any disciplinary area. This envisioned practice environment seeks to expand diffusion of space studies and importantly stimulate motivational strategies that are inclusive across discipline boundaries toward the merits of multi-modal ways of seeing, developing and collaborating through an iterative design process from concept to prototype embracing design thinking in diverse projects. The interdisciplinary space studio's framework acknowledges discipline-based specialisations and the intersection potential of synergistic team approaches through heightened understanding of cross-disciplinary vocabularies. The action-learning lab captures positive general public sentiment toward space discoveries and educative insights of past space exploration and space education with the view that experiencing novel and impactful nature of a wider variety of disciplinary skills and in complementing one's own field can stimulate a continued interest in the promise of the future. Reaching out to disciplines beyond engineering professions including medicine, sports science, psychology, economics, neuroscience, ICT, management, health sciences, construction, education, industrial design, architecture, materials science, nursing, and cultural studies has resulted in challenges in preparing for collaborations and project assessment procedures against shared subject learning outcomes. New 'cross-disciplinary equitable', concise and transparent team charters and an innovative 'patience-to-listen discipline respect framework' has presented a signature undergraduate experience and provided an often discipline absent life-long learning case model fulfilling needs for enriched interdisciplinary experiential learning as an innovation accelerator and responsive practice roadmap across disciplines. ISLab results support preparation for open professional mindsets, heightened confidence and keenness to adopt co-creative action-oriented practice for future work environments. Impacts include university-wide new-to-engagement space futures; student-led reflective activities discussing cross-disciplinary integrative approaches and responses; qualitative measures for prospective positive life impacts both project-based and personal; wider career outlook; and meaningful team goals targeted towards projects with new discovery frontiers of global or inter-global focus - space.",Alexander S.; Bannova O.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2019-01-01,Cullen College of Engineering;Western Sydney University;University of Houston,Design ;  Experiential learning ;  Future work ;  Interdisciplinary ;  Spaceflight
Preparing students for the international new space economy,"Firefly Academy, Inc. is a Private Operating Foundations dedicated to giving students practical experience in the commercial space industry. As the space industry becomes more commercialized, students entering the workforce are going to have increasing opportunities to enjoy careers in commercial space companies. However, recent graduates of undergraduate programs often lack the hands-on skills and experience to let them excel in commercial space companies. To better prepare students to succeed in the commercial space companies, and to help them becomes drivers of innovation and change, incorporating non-traditional, practical programs into traditional education courses is necessary. This paper looks at the approach taken by the flagship company-university partnership initiative undertaken by Firefly Academy, in partnership with Firefly Aerospace, Inc. and the University of Texas. to illustrate the benefits of an interdisciplinary, project-based approach to educating students which combines initiates from the schools of engineering, law, policy, and business as a model for future curriculum enrichment initiatives for other undergraduate students. The flagship program is designed around a corporate-university collaboration facilitated by a non-profit entity. First, the students are given a practical, commercially applicable goal of launching a student-made rocket above the Karman line (100km). Working on this project, whether successful or not, provides real world experience of the technical problems and issues many space start-ups face in the design and development of new technology. Second, the initiate utilizes corporate resources from a private company to provide mentorship, expertise, facilities, and funding to provide the resources the students need to work on and complete the project. The project will span multiple years and involve students from many engineering disciplines. Students can engage in the project either as a class or as a club. The curriculum of both covers a broad range of topics and practical problems faced by commercial companies in the Research & Development process, including engineering, business, compliance, and regulatory issues faced by companies. At first the education will be focuses primarily on technical concepts necessary for the design and building of a rocket but will eventually include compliance and business curriculum as well as students from other disciplines. By giving students a problem to solve which mirrors the issues face by commercial space corporations, and combining an interdisciplinary curriculum with commercial partnerships, students can be better prepared working in the commercial space industry. The success of the program will be measured by the achievement of project goals, the number of students involved, and the percentage of students who matriculate to successful employment post-graduation. As the program proceeds, Firefly Academy will expand its partnerships to other universities, using lessons learned from the flagship program.",Woodford N.; Motiwala I.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2019-01-01,"Firefly Aerospace, Inc.",

Results of space initiatives in piemonte region supporting innovation and internationalization of SME's,"Piemonte Region in Italy is supporting the local SME's in their international business in the Space sector that is evolving in a so called Space 4.0 configuration where, beside the traditional Space Agencies and Institutions, other private and public actors are more and more active. Also the technologies of the Space systems and products are deeply changing through new paradigms based on innovation and sustainability and a New Space Economy era is now in front of us. This both in traditional markets e.g. low cost satellites constellation for TLC applications and in new emerging sectors e.g. Space Exploration Tourism. The space sector SME's, in order to face new opportunities emerging from this evolving situation, have to invest in innovation and internationalization. To support the local SME's in the Internationalization growth, the Piemonte Region is acting through its Agency called Piemonte Agency for Investments and Export (Centro Estero per l'Internazionalizzazione - CEIPIEMONTE) that is involved in these activities since more than 40 years by means of dedicated Integrated Project teams using specifically allocated budgets and methodologies oriented to promote among other objectives the aggregation of the companies. The Aerospace sector in Piemonte is in fact a strategic axis of the regional policy, it accounts about 15000 employees and 4 BEuro of turnover. The presence of 6 big players, more than 300 SME's, 3 Universities and several Research centers confirms the Piemonte as one of the most important Aerospace districts in Europe. Recent Piemonte Agency Space initiatives have been preliminary presented at IAC 2018 in Bremen in their methodology and first steps (see IAC-18.E6.2.12) including in particular dedicated Space Workshops and Working Groups on innovative products. In the first Space Workshop 4 regional space key players were able to propose 8 innovative product ideas having possible application in market commercial projects by next 3 or 4 years. Following a well consolidated CEIPIEMONTE approach 8 Working Groups have been originated including the companies proposing the idea and those partners which were interested in the development of the new product on the basis of relevant competencies. The product technical and programmatic feasibility has been investigated in order to issue a proposal to some supporting Organizations (e.g. Piemonte Regional Government, ESA, ASI, EC, private entities) willing to co-finance the Product development non-recurring activities. In line with CEIPIEMONTE well consolidated practice, some SME's teams investigated the possibility to originate a cluster that is essential to improve their critical mass in front of the global competition. Such clusters are conceived with proper governance scheme that ensures win-win approach for the partners and flexible low cost organization. Other two Space Workshops have been organized in 2018 focusing respectively on the evaluation of the first 8 initiatives results and on the spatialization of 28 Environmental and Thermal Control equipment's coming from other sectors. Today some of these initiatives have reached significant achievements in terms of results for the involved SME's and other are in progress targeting interesting results in the next coming years. The paper after an introduction on the Space market and regional background, will detail above results and will describe possible perspectives.",Giorgini D.; Resce M.; Messidoro P.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2019-01-01,Piemonte Agency for Export and Investments,Innovation and Internationalization ;  New Space Market ;  Piedmont Region Aerospace District ;  Piemonte Agency ;  SME's ;  Space Clusters
Creative connectivity project – A network based approach to understand correlations between interdisciplinary group dynamics and creative performance,"Creativity, technology and innovation are fundamental driving forces that often trigger behavioural and cultural changes in our societies. Several studies on creative collaborations emphasise the interconnection between the creation of innovation and interdisciplinarity. Studying the interdisciplinary processes through which innovation is generated is thus of fundamental importance. The Creative Connectivity project investigates the links between group dynamics and interdisciplinary creative processes in the attempt to identify the emergence of meaningful behavioural patterns. Taking the Innovation Design Engineering (IDE) programme at the Royal College of Art as a case study, the research addresses the need to develop a more rigorous understanding of the creation of innovation fostered by diversity, a risk-taking culture and acceptance of failure. A novel approach combining data science and network theory has been developed to monitor, quantify and analyse specific dynamics of interdisciplinary groups of students at the IDE programme. The focus was to investigate the network contribution to the performance of a team in an environment that is naturally interdisciplinary by using data respectively from a bespoke developed web application and a conversation activity monitoring system. Initial findings have shown the potential of this approach to unveiling the hidden mechanisms behind creativity and the production of innovation through interdisciplinary approaches. The results of this research could be of interest for universities, research centres, start-ups incubators, and policymakers who want to foster creativity and trigger innovative processes.",Torrisi V.; Manfredi S.; Iacopini I.; Latora V.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Towards a New Innovation Landscape, E and PDE 2019",2019-01-01,The Alan Turing Institute;Royal College of Art;Queen Mary University of London;Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II;Università degli Studi di Catania,Connectivity ;  Group dynamics ;  Innovation ;  Interdisciplinary process ;  Network theory
Building a local curricular diffusion model based on a gamified homework platform in first year engineering: A case study,"Implementation of educational innovations on a local scale requires consideration of a variety of different factors including stakeholders, curriculum design, classroom context, and culture. Although theories exist for dimensions of scale and diffusion of educational innovations across multiple institutions, they do not focus on the elements necessary to achieve a successful diffusion of a curricular innovation in a local context. This work leverages Actor Network Theory (ANT) and other theories on dimensions of scale to develop a framework for the local diffusion of a digital gamified homework platform called 3D GameLab. As a case study, we offer research findings around the key actors in the local curricula scale-up network and explore the relationships between these actors and how they work together to ensure an effective implementation. This model can be used as a guide for engineering education practitioners when seeking to expand the reach of their local educational innovations.",Streiner S.; Bodnar C.,Journal,Advances in Engineering Education,2019-01-01,Rowan University,Diffusion ;  Educational software ;  First-year Curriculum

Screencasts are screen captures of learning materials, broken into detailed steps with narration and synchronized captions provided by an instructor. With screencasts, students are able to follow the instructor's elaboration of the problem step-by-step to understand the underlying principles. Our screencasts approach is targeted at upper level technical courses in Civil Engineering and focuses on inclusive Civil Engineering classroom with deaf students. A bank of thirty eight screencasts was developed in 2012 and has been applied to supplement a Civil Engineering undergraduate core course: Structural Analysis. The screencasts are posted on the instructor's teaching website, and are open to all students and interpreters participating in this course. The final calculated grades of the hearing students and the deaf students were collected for five consecutive academic years from 2011 to 2015. The grades of the hearing students and the deaf students were analyzed and compared before and after the screencasts were introduced. Another comparable Civil Engineering course without screencasts, Elementary Structures, was selected as a benchmark to evaluate the effects of screencasts on students' learning. Surveys were performed to gather students' feedback about their experience in using screencasts. The research results show that implementing screencasts to supplement traditional Civil Engineering lectures may enhance both deaf and hearing students' learning effectiveness.",Bao A.,Journal,Advances in Engineering Education,2019-01-01,Rochester Institute of Technology,Civil engineering ;  Performance ;  Streaming video
Exploring liberatory makerspaces: Preliminary results and future directions,"Since the mid-2000s, the U.S. maker movement has heralded the 'democratization' of tools and skills needed for innovation (Autodesk 2012; Cavalcanti 2013; Deloitte 2015; Dubrow 2015b; Kalil, Patel, and Miller 2014; SBS Viceland 2017; Obama White House 2014, 2016). Considering its involvement of old and new technologies (e.g., blacksmithing, 3D printing), various settings (e.g., urban, rural, educational, community), and identity groups (e.g., class, race), the maker movement is well poised to engage historically and systematically minoritized groups in engineering. However, maker communities perpetuate exclusionary practices, replicating power dynamics often seen in engineering and catering more to white, male, cisgender, heterosexual, middle-class, abled hobbyists (Chachra 2015; Foster 2017; Masters 2018; Vossoughi, Hooper, and Escude 2016). Still, some makerspaces engage individuals who are homeless (Make: 2015), low-income (CSW 2014; Station North Tool Library n.d.), LGBTQ+ (DeCusatis, Horacek, and Harihareswara n.d.; Liberating Ourselves Locally 2012), people of color (Craddock 2015; Open Works n.d.), from rural communities (CSW 2014; Floyd CFA n.d.), and disabled (Dubrow 2015a; McGinnis 2014). This project considers how diverse makerspaces are conceived, constructed, and operated to actively involve groups traditionally minoritized in STEM. Using participatory action research (PAR), we seek to identify practices to inform the design and implementation of makerspaces yet to achieve diversity.",Masters A.; Foster E.; Groen-Mccall C.; Mcnair L.; Riley D.,Journal,Advances in Engineering Education,2019-01-01,Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University;Purdue University,Diversity concerns ;  Ethnography ;  Makerspace
STEM education in the United Arab Emirates: Challenges and possibilities,"Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education has become a popular learning approach globally in the 21st century. This is because the world is on the brink of a technological revolution which has its roots in these fields. The present study takes an in-depth look into the United Arab Emirates (UAE) economy as a model that has exemplified the drive towards innovation and a knowledge-driven economy to meet up with current realities. The present study was framed as a theoretical review to address the topic under consideration, relying on evidence from relevant literature. A total of 63 articles were reviewed and they include government reports, news publications, primary research studies, and theoretical analysis. These materials were utilized to comprehensively synthesize research on the current stance of STEM education in the UAE, as well as the challenges faced, and projected possibilities. Findings revealed that the UAE has made better progress but is limited by challenges such as lack of interest in STEM fields by UAE nationals and, the inaccessibility of STEM education across all age groups and income earners. In the face of opportunities such as the development of collaborative learning, a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) boost of at least 12% and, the preparation of Emiratis for the future workplace, recommendations were made. This present study recommends that still there is need for intensification of effort on personal and professional development for teachers of STEM which will consequently affect the interest of students in STEM fields. Also, STEM education should be made accessible across all age groups and all citizens, regardless of their financial status. Further research should focus on expanding the scale of this research to include a participant pool in order to elicit responses and reflections from a group of students, schools, or instructors, using more in-depth qualitative research methods.",Al Murshidi G.,Journal,"International Journal of Learning, Teaching and Educational Research",2019-01-01,United Arab Emirates University,Artificial Intelligence ;  Fourth Industrial Revolution ;  STEM ;  United Arab Emirates
Preservice teachers' adoption of a makerspace,"Innovation includes new inventions, new ideas, or new methods. Everett Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations framework, however, suggests not all are willing to adopt innovation. Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) indicates that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use influence one's choice to use available technology. Since the nature of work is rapidly changing, the future workforce needs to be prepared to innovate or adopt innovation. This means that educators also need to be innovators or early adopters. In this study, education majors in an instructional technology class in the United States were introduced to the idea of a makerspace. When they were given choices, some participants tried new tools or methods without the instructor's assistance, and some tried with the assistance. However, there was also a group of education majors who chose not to try out new tools or methods, even they knew that the help was available. This finding implies that Rogers' theory about people's aptitude of adopting innovation and TAM are applicable to future educators.",Yamamoto J.,Conference Proceeding,"16th International Conference on Cognition and Exploratory Learning in Digital Age, CELDA 2019",2019-01-01,Slippery Rock University,Adoption ;  Diffusion of Innovation ;  Makerspace ;  Teacher Education ;  Technology Acceptance Model
Smart engineering modeling for smart industrial products,"Automation of industrial and consumer products has reached the level on which systems provide for the capability to supervise decisions on physical actions and execution of these actions. Development of these industrial products proceed during their full lifecycle requiring lifecycle integration of innovation, manufacturing, and application as well as utilization the recently emerged methodology of continuous engineering. Engineering in the above level of industrial technology requires contextually integrated model system which serves all research, development, production, and operational activities during the integrated life cycle of product. Smart product requires smart model system which has the capability to recognize situation and apply it at decision on values of relevant product object parameters in virtual to control physical operation of product. This paper introduces recent contributions in modeling for smart engineering. It starts with a novel general model of integrated smart engineering system. Considering this model, smart engineering specific upgrade of formerly published concept of virtual engineering space (VES) is introduced. VES upgrade concentrates on research as key issue in giving smart characteristics for contexts in VES model system. Following this, contextual driving of object parameters is outlined for integrated smart engineering system.

Learning smart through REKBEN tube for basic electric and electronic subjects,"Technology is one of the factors that influences innovation in supporting learning activities as well as having the potential to help deliver meaningful learning to students. Electrical and electronic subjects are important subjects in technical and vocational schools as well as in the daily school divisions. It is difficult to understand the concept of how electric current flows. For example, a verbalized description of a printed reference may not give a person a clear image of the exact theory or concept that is intended to be conveyed. The problem that contributes to limiting the minds of young people in engineering is the lack of media technology in terms of helping students to understand the concept of electricity and electronics. The lack of tool kits in education that provide the technical characteristics that can illustrate the conditions of electricity and electronics made this research work. Therefore, this research proposal is to design, move, develop, and test the effectiveness of Augmented Reality (AR) technology focusing on electrical and electronic subjects as a teaching aid as well as reference materials to technical and vocational students. The results of this research will make technology increasingly in demand by researchers and educators. This will provide more attention to the emergence of technology to further integrate this matter so that teaching and learning will become more effective and helpful in the STEM field in the future.",Zulkifli C.; Hassan N.; Hassan H.; Sedon M.; Noerhartati E.; Andjarwati T.; Sustiyatik E.; Ridwan A.; Susilo K.,Journal,"International Journal of Innovation, Creativity and Change",2019-01-01,Universitas 17 Agustus 1945 Surabaya;Narotama University;Universitas Wijaya Kusuma Surabaya;Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris;Universitas Kadiri,Augmented reality ;  Education tool kit ;  Electric and electronic subject
The knowledge body of requirement engineering in IST innovations: An ontological analysis,"Requirement Engineering is considered a key factor for Information Systems and Technology (IST) success in innovation. After roughly 40 years, important questions about the impact of RE in innovations remains. Literature review and bibliometric reports are well-known techniques for describing the state of the art; however, both can cover what has been done, but fail to identify the less developed areas. An alternative method is used to describe the whole knowledge body of RE (KBoRE) for IST innovations, and then systematically identify the most, less and uncovered areas. This paper proposes an Ontological framework of the KBoRE for IST innovations, by decomposing it through the identification of taxonomies and concepts that represent the field. Then, we apply the ontology to map articles from SCOPUS and WoS databases. Results reveal emphases that help to design research agendas and feed the KBoRE for IST Innovations to fill the gaps between the academic curiosity and the industry progress.",Vásquez J.; La Paz A.,Journal,Journal of Technology Management and Innovation,2019-01-01,Universidad de Chile;Universidad de Valparaiso,Digital Transformation ;  Information System ;  Innovation ;  Ontological Analysis ;  Requirement Engineering

Library and student innovation center: MakerSpace!,"— In May 2012, Governor Mead, the State legislature, and the Wyoming Governor’s Energy, Engineering, and STEM Integration Taskforce articulated a vision to propel the College of Engineering and Applied Science (CEAS) and the University of Wyoming to the realms of “excellence in instruction, research, and service.” Part of this initiative included development of a network of Student Innovation Centers (SIC) on the University of Wyoming campus. The initiative began with the development of the Coe Library Student Innovation Center (CSIC) makerspace, in order to spark student innovation, creativity, and design skills. This was a cooperative effort of the College of Engineering and Applied Science together with the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Education, and the University of Wyoming Libraries. The initiative also included development of another active learning “makerspace” in the new Engineering Education and Research Building (EERBSIC). Makerspaces employ technology along with hands-on education to spark student innovation, creativity, design, and entrepreneurship. This paper describes the importance of makerspaces to education, the step-by-step approach used to develop and launch a makerspace, lessons learned and used in the development of the EERBSIC, and a sample of programs conducted within the makerspace. This paper serves as a useful guide for other institutions that are considering setting up a makerspace.",Barrett S.; Dousay T.; Kerr T.; Schmidt L.; Gellis B.; Ballard J.,Journal,Computers in Education Journal,2019-01-01,University of Wyoming,Active learning ;  Constructionism ;  Constructivism ;  DIY ;  Entrepreneurial ;  Index Terms—makerspace ;  Innovation ;  Problem-based learning ;  STEAM
Developing devices for people with disabilities: Challenges and gains of project-based service learning,"The development of a product according to specific requirements is the engineers’ core mission. Therefore, engineering programs need to equip their graduates with the tools to deal with the entire cycle of product development. Project-Based Service Learning (PBSL) is a hands-on pedagogical approach that involves the development of a product for the benefit of society. PBSL provides students with opportunities to design and develop innovative solutions for real clients with real needs. The study focuses on the perceptions of 13 mechanical engineering graduates who participated in a one-semester Rehabilitation Biomechanics course that includes development of tailor-made and low-cost assistive devices for people with special needs. The study aims to evaluate the long-term impact of PBSL on graduates, after several years of employment in industry. The course is a part of an ORT Braude College of Engineering flagship project: ‘‘Engineers on Behalf of People with Disabilities’’. The study uses the Grounded Theory qualitative research methodology that allows revealing ideas that could not be foreseen. Interviews with the graduates exposed the challenges they experienced during the course as well as the gains. They have developed an awareness of the roles of engineering solutions in assisting people with special needs. The direct and challenging interaction with disabled customers changed their attitudes towards people with special needs, and developed in them an empathetic Client-Centered Design approach. The PBSL experience influenced graduates’ interests, careers, and personal development, and the skills they brought to their workplaces. Research shows how PBSL may bridge the gap between theory and practice, looking at the community as a legitimate partner in the development of innovations. An outcome of the flagship project is the founding of an online ‘‘Knowledge Base for Daily Life Activities (DLA) Solutions’’ resource, which is available to the public.",Muller O.; Dangur V.; Benyamin O.,Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2019-01-01,ORT Braude - College of Engineering,Engineering education ;  People with disabilities ;  Project-based service learning ;  Rehabilitation biomechanics
Considering capstone team member roles with a shared leadership framework,"Managing student roles and responsibilities in team-based courses often presents challenges for both faculty and students. At the 2018 Capstone Design Conference, a panel discussion specifically addressed the impact of roles and responsibilities on teams in capstone design. This paper summarizes the main discussion points of that panel session and relates these topics to a model of shared leadership and distributed influence in the innovation process. The shared leadership model addressed in this study combines an Input-Process-Output (IPO) model from research on teams with existing leadership behavior literature to link team characteristics and leadership practices to team responses and team effectiveness. The students and faculty that comprised the panel represented diverse areas: engineering practice, military teams, academia, and undergraduate design. Detailed notes from the panel session were analyzed by panel members to identify themes and current practices that emerged from the discussion. These themes and practices were mapped to the existing shared leadership model to situate the phenomena in the larger IPO model and positions the phenomena in current organizational leadership literature. The result of this study is a capstone design-specific adaptation of the existing shared leadership model. This model provides capstone faculty and students a more comprehensive framework in which to consider how team roles and responsibilities may affect team response and effectiveness. Conclusions from this study stress the criticality of capstone design faculty in team formation to foster shared leadership. The framework suggests that shared leadership within the team may elicit positive team response through accountability and responsibility and will lead to greater team effectiveness. Specific recommendations for capstone design courses are offered and recommendations for future research are addressed.",Novoselich B.; Kotys-Schwartz D.; Demoret K.; Nunez M.; Brackin P.,Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2019-01-01,Penn State Behrend;The U.S. Military Academy at West Point;Rose Hulman Institute Technology;Florida Institute of Technology;University of Colorado Boulder,Shared leadership ;  Team roles ;  Teamwork
Using relative tie strength to identify core teams of scientific research,"In China, it has long become imperative for the management of education, science and technology to build up high-level teams of scientific and technological innovation. Scientifically and accurately identifying core scientific research teams is an important prerequisite for cultivating and building such teams. The absolute threshold method (e.g., c-level clique at, n- clique, kcore) is the prevailing means of identifying core teams and their core members. Multiple factors such as ""the preference-dependent effect"", ""the apostle effect"" and ""the star effect"", and the cooperative relationship between the researchers could be considered. This study, based on the co-authorship network, found that not choosing the absolute threshold properly could easily lead to poor identification of core members of some teams. Even worse, when the absolute threshold is too large, this ""uniform"" evaluation criterion of tie strength results in the elimination of some core teams in some disciplines. This paper uses the relative tie strength to identify core scientific research teams from a new perspective, which can effectively avoid the situation of some core team members being ignored because of the mandatory requirements of the absolute tie strength among members, and can also solve the challenge of threshold selections for identifying different teams.",Zhang M.; Jia Y.; Wang N.; Ge S.,Journal,International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning,2019-01-01,Jiangsu University of Science and Technology,Relative strength of cooperative relationship ;  Science of science ;  Scientific cooperation ;  Scientific research team ;  Team core members ;  Team leaders
Experimental Study on Performance of Fiber Concrete-filled Tube Columns under Axial Loading,"There have been great developments in the area of civil engineering in the recent few decades and among these, construction and material innovation are quite prominent. Steel-concrete composite construction has emerged as one of the fastest methods of construction. Even though considerable research efforts on conventional reinforced concrete columns have been executed prior to now, concrete filled steel tube (CFST) composite columns however have received limited attention. This work aims to study the experimental behavior of steel tubular specimens. Plastic and steel specimens are considered with circular and square sections filled with the concrete with the steel fiber and as well, plain concrete. Four parameters are considered in this study which are sectional designs (circular and square), tube thickness (2 and 5 mm), tube material (plastic and steel) and content of steel fiber (0 and 5%). Ten concrete filled steel tubular columns were cast and tested. Two circular columns were made from plastic and the other made from steel. The main purpose of this work are study the effect of steel fiber and cross section on the ultimate load capacity of columns. It was discovered the utilization of steel fiber reinforced concrete filled steel tubular columns have comparatively substantial stiffness in comparison with plain concrete filled columns.",Mohammed A.; Khalaf R.; Mohammedali T.; Hussin A.,Journal,"International Journal of Engineering, Transactions B: Applications",2019-01-01,University Of Diyala,Axial Loading ;  Columns ;  Composite ;  Concrete ;  Steel Fiber ;  Steel Tube
Development and implementation of a mobile application for the measurement of temperature and relative humidity in greenhouse crops,"The tendency in recent years to improve worldwide agricultural production has opened the door to innovative research techniques to prevent diseases, pests, and negative consequences due to climate variations in crops. This study aims to develop an acquisition system using the embedded BeagleBone Black and the DHT 22 sensor, which allow measuring the physical parameters of temperature and relative humidity; these were registered in a database that was created in MySQL. The system was implemented within a greenhouse crop; additionally, a mobile application was developed, written in Kotlin language, to facilitate monitoring the physical parameters of temperature and relative humidity remotely, so that farmers can collect valuable information about their crops wherever they are. This development was carried out using a client-server structure, making use of free software and hardware, which makes for a low-cost, easily-implemented system for farmers. The monitoring system worked as expected, and the information obtained was reliable. The results show that the implementation is useful in greenhouse agriculture and that, through digital innovation, effective agricultural practices can be improved which could increase production and decrease costs, making use of modern technologies.",Rodríguez-Soto L.; Martínez A.; Arellano-Ramírez I.,Journal,INMATEH - Agricultural Engineering,2019-01-01,Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira,Agriculture innovation ;  Greenhouse crop ;  Mobile application ;  Monitoring system ;  Rural engineering

Prospects of low-pressure cold spray for superhydrophobic coatings,"A major challenge in materials engineering is the development of new materials and methods and/or novel combination of existing ones, all fostering innovation. For that reason, this study aims at the synergy between low-pressure cold spray (LPCS) as a tool for coating deposition and sol-gel technique for fabrication of the feedstock powder. The complementarity of both methods is important for the examined topic. On one side, the LPCS being automized and quick mean provides the solid-state of feedstock material in nondestructive conditions and hence the hydrophobicity imparted on the sol-gel route is preserved. On the other side, the sol-gel synthesis enables the production of oxide materials with enhanced deformability due to amorphous form which supports the anchoring while LPCS spraying. In the paper, several aspects including optimal fluoroalkylsilane (FOTS) concentration or substrate roughness are examined initially for altering the superhydrophobicity of produced coatings. Further, it is shown that the appropriate optimization of feedstock powder, being submicron silica matrices covered with two-layer FOTS sheath, may facilitate the anchoring process, support roughening the substrate or cause enhancement the coating hydrophobicity. All the discussion is supported by the characteristics including surface morphology, wettability and thermal behaviour examined by electron microscopy, water contact angle measurements and thermal analysis (TGA/DSC), respectively. The coatings presented in the paper are characterized by an uneven thickness of up to a few silica particles, but final hydrophobicity is provided uniformly on the surface by the formation of multi-level roughness by a detachment of outer layer from the SiO2 particles. Thus, the presented approach constitutes a simple and fast solution for the fabrication of functionalized coatings using LPCS including industrial potential and fundamental research character.",Gibas A.; Baszczuk A.; Jasiorski M.; Winnicki M.,Journal,Coatings,2019-01-01,Politechnika Wrocławska,Hydrophobic coatings ;  Low-pressure cold spray ;  Multi-level roughness ;  Silica modification with FOTS ;  Thin SiO  cold sprayed coatings 2
Considerations for a contemporary 3D cadastre for our times,"A significant number of studies has been carried out to establish 3D cadastre solutions to improve the registration of multi-level property. Since the inception of research on 3D cadastres (about 20 years ago), the world around us has changed significantly and this also partly changes the context regarding 3D cadastre: technology (e.g. visualisation of 3D information), acquisition techniques and BIM data availability, and policy and organisational structures. This paper aims to explore the implications of these changes on 3D cadastre research with a view to discussing considerations for a contemporary 3D cadastre for our times. The paper draws on social and technical trends, challenges, and gaps around 3D cadastre practices from three jurisdictions: the Australian state of Victoria, the Netherlands, and Singapore. The cases have been selected as examples of well-functioning and highly trusted cadastres and land registries committed to innovation in this area, and whose practitioners and researchers are leading the research in this domain. This set provides a breadth of insight that informs our discussion. However, we acknowledge the limitations of the findings as the research undertaken in these jurisdictions is not complicated by other issues with registration or cadastres as they may occur in other countries.",Stoter J.; Ho S.; Biljecki F.,Conference Proceeding,"International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives",2019-01-01,National University of Singapore;RMIT University;Delft University of Technology,3D Cadastre ;  3D Land Administration ;  Singapore ;  The Netherlands ;  Victoria (Australia)

Through international imitation, emerging countries have the opportunity to adopt clean techniques of developed countries. Because of different industrial structures, it is unachievable to learn the green technology across all fields. Previous studies consider that innovations could create green production models to improve the production capacity that reduces energy input and waste discharge. However, while evaluating emerging countries' economic growth, the environment indicators were often neglected. Empirical investigation of the role of innovation in green economy's growth is still rare. The first objective of this study is to adopt an integrated framework to investigate emerging countries' green economy by considering environmental factors. Secondly, environmentally sensitive productivity growth index was employed to decompose the productivity progress of green economy into catch-up effect, innovation effect, and technical leadership to examine the role of innovation. Thirdly, implications were provided for the policy makers in relation to green growth. Thirty-nine emerging countries were chosen as samples, which were divided into America, Asia, and Europe according to their locations. We found that America is still an imitator in developing green economy. In contrast, Asia starts to transition to innovation, which has become another critical promoter for green growth. Europe was found to lead on the technology frontier because of proper industrial planning and technology accumulation. The progress to innovation and technical leadership could ensure a stable green growth in the future. This research could be a route to open up the possibility of extending current study of green economy.",Lin B.; Wang S.,Journal,Mathematical Problems in Engineering,2019-01-01,Guangdong University of Finance & Economics;Taizhou Vocational College of Science and Technology,

Flipped classroom: A renewal opportunity or a pedagogical Cul-De-Sac?,"Flipped classroom (FC) has gained significant recognition in higher education as a way to fundamentally alter the course structure and revolutionize the teaching and learning experience. FC entails assigning digitally mediated instructional content as preparation before class, and thus free up class time to cultivate higher-order thinking skills, problem solving, threshold concepts and engage in collaborative learning. Despite a predominantly large interest in this educational innovation, there are a number of pedagogical challenges that need to be highlighted. This paper examines the educational implications of using FC in a higher education context, which emerged from my own experiences with the systematic use of FC in teaching a course in Change Management (CM). Based on recent literature within the use of FC, I discuss both the pedagogical rationale and the critical points that I have become aware of in my teaching. I thus extend the argument to question the adherence to any particular model or delivery modes, as in the case of FC, which risks reinforcing various content transmission paradigms. Rather, the attention should at all times be on the underlying pedagogy, focused on developing, delivering, and evaluating learning experiences that promote effective and significant improvements in student achievement. Using technology to enhance learning requires a more radical redesign of the teaching and learning experience, which takes advantage of the technological affordances for creating hybrid, flexible learning and enabling new ways of knowing, working and becoming within and across various disciplinary and professional fields. Based on recent literature regarding FC, I identify the pedagogical challenges that exist, despite the popularity of FC as educational innovation. I compare some of the critical points with my own experience with adopting FC in a course in Change Management (CM). I discuss the pros and cons with FC in the light of a written student evaluation of experienced learning from the CM-course as FC. The discussion will lean against research in university pedagogy and learning design.",Gnaur D.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the European Conference on e-Learning, ECEL",2019-01-01,Aalborg University,Flipped classroom ;  Learning design ;  Technology enhanced learning ;  University pedagogy
Aluminum-Based Nano-energetic Materials: State of the Art and Future Perspectives,"Technological innovations are indeed driven by enhanced abilities to understand and manipulate matter at molecular and atomic scale. Engineering energetic nanocomposites with tailored and tunable combustion characteristics is indispensable for their deployment in both civilian and defense applications. Specifically, a heterogeneous mixture of fuel [aluminum (Al), boron, magnesium, silicon, etc.] and oxidizer [cupric oxide, bismuth trioxide (Bi2O3), ferric oxide, etc.] with both the constituents having nanoscale dimensions constitutes a class of energetic material known as nanothermites. Among various fuels employed in nano-energetic formulations, the number of theoretical and experimental investigations on the utilization of Al outweighs that of any other metallic fuel. Knowledge on the physical and chemical characteristics of the constituents and their impact on combustion performance are fundamental to accelerate the pace of research and development in nano-energetic composites. Efforts to develop comprehensive understanding of the oxidation behavior are discussed in this article. Furthermore, the organization, intimacy, and dimensions of discrete fuels and oxidizers apart from their chemistry largely dictate the combustion kinetics exhibited by nanothermites. For a given nanocomposite, increasing the interfacial contact area between fuel and oxidizer improves its reaction rate by 3–5 orders of magnitude as a result of drastic reduction in mass and heat transport lengths. The bottom-up self-assembly process offers the most realistic solution to enhance the interfacial contacts between nanoscale constituents employing different approaches. This review summarizes the key findings in this area of research and lists the key challenges and opportunities for furthering the application aspects. Enhancement of combustion characteristics of energetic liquids through the utilization of Al and metal oxide nanoparticles as additives is another area of related research that continues to receive increasing attention (Sundaram et al. 2017). Energetic liquids possess unique characteristics such as lower activation temperature, higher pressure, and better volume expansion. Experimental research efforts have demonstrated ample promise for overcoming the inherent problems such as lower energy density and slow burn kinetics associated with energetic liquids. In gist, the central theme of this chapter is devoted to highlight and analyze the recent advancements on aluminum-based nano-energetic materials besides presenting the challenges and opportunities in the domain of nano-energetic materials development.",Thiruvengadathan R.,Book Series,"Energy, Environment, and Sustainability",2019-01-01,"Amrita School of Engineering, Coimbatore",Aluminum ;  Combustion ;  Energetic fuels ;  Nano-energetic materials ;  Oxidation ;  Surface passivation
Reflection of literature on using lean innovation models for Start-Up ventures,"This paper discusses lean innovations and lean startup methods for the engineering management field. The aim of the literature review is to explain the methods and processes used in a lean startup. First, we discuss the concept of the startup and the impact that innovation has on startups and organizations seeking to implement lean innovations models. The assumption made in the hypothesis is that lean startup can be applied to areas outside of high-tech entrepreneurship. This hypothesis is further explored in the research. The findings in this paper suggest that innovation and entrepreneurship are highly influenced by innovation and company cultures. We find that technology transfer plays a key role in fostering innovation. However, there are barriers to public-private innovation partnerships, which are discussed in this paper.",Galli B.,Journal,Journal of Modern Project Management,2019-01-01,Hofstra University,Entrepreneurship ;  Lean innovations ;  Lean startup ;  Startup
Pedagogical engineering to the teaching of the practical experiments of chemistry: Development of an application of three-dimensional digital modelling of crystalline structures,"Technological innovation in science provides complementary tools for exploring new teaching strategies within a pedagogical framework that promotes interaction between the teacher and the learner.

The student’s stance on transversal competencies: A multivariable analysis,"INTRODUCTION. Quality training is one that matches the social and labour needs of the moment. Transversal competences are part of the university curriculum and its relevance lies in its ability to be generalizable and transferable to the different contexts and activities in the current volatile and complex labour market. METHOD. The methodological design of this research is descriptive and transversal and aims to assess the training in transversal competences of undergraduate students. In order to do this, an analysis of the discrepancies between the development of competences, the student's domain and the importance granted to professional development is established. A multivariable procedure on professional development provides information on satisfaction, effectiveness, functionality and the adequacy of the training. The research involves 1.137 final year students of the five areas of knowledge of the University of Murcia, through an ad hoc designed questionnaire. RESULTS. The data show a degree of medium-low satisfaction with the training received especially in the Experimental Sciences; the effectiveness of the university is different in the areas of knowledge, in the same way as the perception of usefulness of training for professional development. Engineering students obtain the highest scores on both variables. In addition, there is an imbalance between development, domain and relevance that can be extended to all degrees. However, despite the discrepancies detected, it shows a positive trend towards the adaptation of university training to professional requirements. DISCUSSION. The results show priority lines of action in the direction of current trends in innovation and research to reorient the university system towards a project of excellence and connection with the social and labour market.",Clares P.; Morga Y.,Journal,Bordon.

"Specimen size and shape effects on the concrete properties, thermal conductivity and heat generation from hydration for different concrete types","The environmental impact, manufacture and the application of concrete have many influences, some of which are influential and complex. Construction engineers are looking for modern ideas and methods that make the building more efficient in terms of functionality, cost, high strength, reduced overloads and increased efficiency of unlimited geometric shapes. The main factor in the improvement and development of concrete structures rely on the engineering characteristics of the substances. The developments in the construction materials, mix proportions, dimensions, mixing, and conditions (temperature) used to enhance the concrete technology, have important impacts on characteristics of concrete strength and heat development manner. The heat generation from concrete reveals the components of concrete materials and mix balances as well as the innovations in structure and environmental circumstances. This research presented an experimental investigation of the significance of the specimen’s shape and the size of the concrete properties durability, thermal conductivity and heat generation. Cylinders, prisms, and cubes of different sizes and shapes will be used. This research concluded that the effect of molds shape and size decreased when the (strength in compression, splitting tensile strength, flexural strength, and concrete density) increasing, that’s mean for ultra-high-strength concrete the difference is much smaller. The concrete hydration due to heat increases with increasing of the concrete strength and size, and the difference in heat transfer with the increasing of specimen’s size decreasing with increasing of concrete size. It is completely identified that the deformation and intensity of reinforced concrete beams depend on the size of the beam. Effect of concrete types (normal 26 MPa, high 46 MPa, and ultra-high-strength concrete 61 MPa) on the design of reinforced concrete beam was studied with three different depth (170, 155 and 150 mm). Results revealed that high strength and ultra-high-strength concrete was able to substitute for the reduction in beams size with the same strength. For concrete that is high or ultra-high-strength a reduction in the beam depth of about (8.82%) and (11.76%) compared to the normal concrete beam where achieved.",Qasim O.,Journal,Journal of Computational and Theoretical Nanoscience,2019-01-01,Al-Mansour University College,Beam ;  Concrete Properties ;  Heat of Hydration ;  Shape ;  Size ;  Thermal Conductivity

Creating innovative products with reference system elements - A case study on approaches in practice,"As any other human being development engineers preferably act based on experience. Hence it is comprehensible that even for a product that initially appears revolutionary usually one or more references can be found. This enhances, for example, the comparability or the availability of a products subsystems so that they are more easily to deal with. Especially during the development of a new product, which means the start of a new product line, the use of reference system elements helps to reduce development efforts. Reference system elements are, for example, physical products whose functions or components are relevant for one’s own product. By scanning the system of objectives for smaller subsystems one may find those functions or components just mentioned. For this scientific work a development process of a technology rollout was examined. The objective pursued was to gain insights on possibilities and challenges of deriving knowledge from such reference system elements in this specific case. A suitable research environment was offered by a medium sized machine manufacturer. A new technology to process foam particles using radio frequency is being developed there. The established process using steam is already in the high-end range, which is why only a small development potential is left. From the findings in this case study in synthesis with the state of the art on innovation management and knowledge management a descriptive process model is derived. The focus of the process model is to support the search for relevant reference system elements. For the examined machine, for example, the common microwave was used as a reference element. The elements found can be evaluated for their suitability using previously elaborated validation criteria. This facilitates the adoption of existing solutions or the development of new solutions based on reference system elements.",Richter T.; Rapp S.; Kurtz V.; Romanov V.; Albers A.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2019-01-01,Karlsruher Institut für Technologie;Kurtz GmbH,Innovation Management ;  Knowledge Management ;  New Product Development – NPD ;  Product Generation Engineering – PGE ;  Reference System

On the Benefits of Corporate Hackathons for Software Ecosystems – A Systematic Mapping Study,"Software companies have increasingly organised hackathons since the early 2010s. These time-bounded, intensive, collaborative and solution-oriented events enable companies to generate several ideas, some of which can be used to evolve their products and services. Hackathons are means to gather feedback from outside to innovate. Companies also follow such open innovation trend by raising software ecosystems via a platformisation process. They create platforms so that third parties can develop new software solutions and in doing so extend the current product portfolio. In this scenario, a hackathon can be seen as a strategy to support ecosystem evolution. Therefore, we decided to conduct a systematic mapping study to investigate the benefits that hackathons can provide to software ecosystems. This paper presents our analysis of twenty-seven papers on corporate hackathons in the software industry. As main findings, we (i) describe a set of fourteen social, technical and business benefits; as well as (ii) discuss how companies can leverage ecosystem health by conducting hackathons. We address the scarcity of research around the outcomes of corporate hackathons. Besides, we conclude that hackathons are alternative modes of production and innovation, which can catalyse a software ecosystem.",Valença G.; Lacerda N.; Rebelo M.; Alves C.; de Souza C.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2019-01-01,Universidade Federal de Pernambuco;Universidade Federal do Pará;Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco,Corporate hackathons ;  Open innovation ;  Software ecosystems ;  Systematic mapping study
Engineering design concept generation: The effect of concept combination and classification,"World economic forum reported that creativity is one of the most sought after skills by employers globally. Preliminary research lead to multiple initiatives on enhancing creativity and innovation. To contribute in this field, we investigated the effect of two interventions on the creativity of undergraduate engineering students, particularly on engineering design concept generation. The primary focus of this investigation was on assessing the effect of two interventions, combining and classifying concepts, on the originality and quantity of the concepts produced. In this research, we used the Decision Tree for Originality Assessment in Design (DTOAD) as a measure of concept originality. Statistical analysis showed that both the combine and the classify interventions lead to concept generation with higher originality. We also found that students produced higher number of the radically different concept, i.e. concepts with originality score 7.5 and above, however this effect was observed in all the test groups. These interventions made improvements and thus can be encouraged as a part of an ideation or an engineering problem solving task in the undergraduate engineering education to help the students develop creative skills.",Deo S.; Hölttä-Otto K.; Bhalerao Y.; Malge A.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference,2019-01-01,MIT Academy of Engineering;Aalto University,Creativity ;  DTOAD ;  Originality ;  Quantitative
Prototype design in agile product development processes for technical systems,"Agile development processes such as Scrum have been successfully applied in the software industry for many years. Based on experience, industrial practitioners indicate three predominant benefits of agile development processes compared to traditional software development processes. First of all, development results better fit customers’ and other stakeholders’ needs. That is because they are intensively involved in the development process by receiving, applying and assessing functional software increments in a defined cadence throughout the development process. Secondly, agile development processes better cope with unexpected changes in the development process due to the built-in process flexibility. Lastly, development speed has significantly increased in most of the agile software development projects, resulting in a shorter time-to-market. Especially in the context of radical innovations for technical systems, manufacturing companies are striving for approaches to optimize their development processes in a similar direction. Traditional plan-oriented development approaches such as VDI 2221 or Cooper’s Stage-Gate Process turn out to be insufficiently customer oriented, too inflexible and project duration is usually too long to reach an adequate time-to-market. For that reason, a large community in academia and industrial practice is developing and implementing approaches to adapt agile software development practices for the development of technical systems. However, a current study in industrial practice reveals that out of 23 objectives, that are expected when introducing agile development processes to technical systems, the three objectives mentioned above, show the largest negative deviations from expected benefit to realized benefit. Therefore, the overall goal of this research is to address these gaps by developing an explicit methodological approach for an agile development of technical systems. It turns out, that mainly the role of prototyping and the way product specifications are handled during the development process change significantly in the course of introducing agility to development of technical systems. Agile practitioners strive to not necessarily define product specifications comprehensively upfront, as it is postulated in plan-oriented development processes. In contrast, product specifications, which are of major importance to the overall development project, are specified and validated with customers and other stakeholders in early prototypes. Therefore, prototypes are realized in a defined cadence throughout the development process to gradually specify and validate the product. However, the way product specifications are prioritized and selected in the development of technical systems has to differ substantially from the general way Scrum or other existing agile development processes propose. That is because technical systems are characterized by multiple technical interrelations, resulting in informational dependencies for the development process. For that reason, a prioritization along criteria such as customer value, development effort and risk seems too narrow in the context of technical systems. In fact, the prioritization of product specifications has to consider both, the value being generated by their realization as well as the informational dependencies towards other specifications. Furthermore, when designing a prototype, time constraints need to be particularly considered due to lead times in parts delivery and prototype production. Therefore, this paper introduces a methodology to prioritize and select technical design parameters in agile development processes. The methodology can be applied in the cyclical sprint planning that aims at defining the scope of the next prototype to be developed. As outlined above, the major paradigms of value generation, informational dependencies as well as lead-time and effort are crucial when adapting agile for technical systems and are consequently implemented in the methodology. These paradigms are operationalized to explicitly address the mentioned major objectives of agile development processes, which are currently showing are large gap between expected benefit and realized benefit in industrial practice. The methodology is applied to the real development process of an RGB laser light source for digital cinema projectors, which is summarized as a case study in the paper. Insights from this application are equally discussed as the resulting next steps in further developing and aligning the methodology to the needs of industrial practice.",Riesener M.; Doelle C.; Schloesser S.; Schuh G.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference,2019-01-01,Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen,
Investigating usability of an innovation management decision aid,"Initial usability testing was used to identify and fix usability concerns within a recently developed absorptive capacity assessment tool. The tool was designed to aid innovation management decision making by helping firms understand their processing of external knowledge within the context of a collaborative innovation network. Part of the recent development of the tool involved the implementation of Simos-Roy-Figueira’s revised method for eliciting subjective importance weights. However, the method, as it was applied within the tool, suffered from poor usability that could not be fully addressed. This paper presents a study on the usability of the tool further by conducting additional think-aloud studies to better understand its nature. Five common attributes of usability (efficiency, effectiveness, satisfaction, learnability, and usefulness) were characterized based on the findings from the think-aloud studies in order to develop a list of recommendations for improving usability. The goal of these recommendations is to help future academic developers of decision aid tools to better consider usability in their own work to maximize the impact and dissemination of their research.",Gendreau E.; Summers J.; Benhayoun-Sadafiyine L.; Le Dain M.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference,2019-01-01,International University of Rabat;Clemson University;INP Grenoble,
Exploring the application of network analytics in characterizing a conceptual design space,"The ability to effectively analyse design concepts is essential for making early stage design decisions. Human evaluations, the most common assessment method, describe individual design concepts on a variety of ideation metrics. However, this approach falls short in creating a holistic representation of the design space as a whole that informs the underlying relations between concepts. Motivated by this shortcoming, this work leverages network theory to visualize and characterize features of a conceptual design space. To illustrate the utility of network theory for these purposes, a network composed of a corpus of solutions to a design problem and their semantic similarity is derived, and its design properties (e.g., uniqueness and innovation potential) are studied. This network-based approach not only characterizes features of individual designs themselves, but also uncovers more nuanced properties of the design space through studying emerging clusters of concepts. Overall, this work expands on developing research in design, demonstrating the value in applying network analytics to a conceptual design space as an engineering support tool to aid design decision-making.",Gyory J.; Goucher-Lambert K.; Kotovsky K.; Cagan J.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the Design Society: International Conference on Engineering Design,2019-01-01,Carnegie Mellon University,Conceptual design ;  Design methods ;  Evaluation
Social sustainability and innovations in tourism: Cases from Slovenia,"This chapter describes the first step in the long-term goal of assessing the sustainable development and tourism innovation potentials of the Adriatic Region and the Balkans (ARB), and the intertwining of both aspects from a longitudinal perspective. The methodological starting point is the EDIT model (Experiences through Design, Innovation and Touchpoints), which was originally developed as a tourism and hospitality development framework, and was later applied to engineering and experience design in tourism. Following theoretical overview, further methodological upgrade of the EDIT model is elaborated, focusing on the fields of tourism sustainability and innovation, and their intersection at tourism products’ touchpoints, i.e. interaction points between the tourism providers and customers. The application of the model is described through a pilot study, conducted in Slovenia in 2017. A secondary source analysis of the ARB region is then used in the development of the research agenda for an EDIT assessment of the ARB. The agenda incorporates current development indicators of the region, their specifics, weaknesses and competitive advantages as they relate to sustainable development and tourism innovations.",Krizaj D.; Sasidharan V.,Book,Sustainable Tourism Practices in the Mediterranean,2019-01-01,San Diego State University;University of Primorska,
Industry 4.0 and Competitiveness,"Industry 4.0 has come to be the beginning of a new era for humanity along with rapidly-progressive technology. Whereas this new era has favourably created fresh opportunities for governments, businesses, and individuals, it is seemingly a problematic step to swiftly integrate these new forthcoming technologies in society in order to sustain economic welfare. First having appeared in the 17th century, the industrial revolutions then prioritised manpower only as a physical force whilst Industry 4.0, last of the industrial revolutions, gives precedence to brainpower as the most prominent element in creating added value. Thus, such circumstances have led to the withdrawal of the foreign direct investments to the countries that have been drawing in these investments owing to their low-cost labour, and therefore caused vital problems within global economy and competitiveness. Industry 4.0 has changed not only the structure of labour but also significant factors that affect competitiveness such as institutions, the financial system, the infrastructure, innovation skills, health, education, and macroeconomic variables. Considerable changes can be observed regarding the competitiveness factors and creating competitive quality and advantages in this ever-changing and-developing world economy. This study evaluates these innovations and changes that have appeared after Industry 4.0 and interprets the statistics and the data. The effects of the emerging innovations on the countries' competitiveness have been investigated after which the positive and negative effects were discussed comparatively.",Bal H.; Erkan Ç.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Computer Science,2019-01-01,Istanbul Üniversitesi;Karadeniz Technical University,Competitiveness ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Labour force

Emotional design: The development of a process to envision emotion-centric new product ideas,"There is ample evidence, in many sectors, of the crucial importance of the emotional experiences in the interaction between users and products. Generating products with richer and significant emotional features is a complex challenge. In order to better face this challenge, professionals responsible for designing and developing new products could be facilitated with techniques and tools to understand emotions and to convey specific emotions in the new products. This paper presents the development of a process to support product design teams to envision emotion-focused new product ideas-Emotion-Driven Innovation (E-DI). We have adopted the process research methodology proposed by Platts, which encompasses four main steps: 1) state-of-the-art review, 2) process creation, 3) process development, and 4) process validation. This paper presents the results of the three first steps. The state-of-the-art literature review has been the foundation of the process creation step, which resulted in a three-phase workshop-based process: Emotion Knowledge Acquisition, Emotion Goal Definition, and Idea Generation. In the third step of the research methodology, the feasibility, usability, and utility have been tested through four studies which have involved master design students from Portugal and Italy. The results of these four tests show that Emotion-Driven Innovation process supports designers 1) to identify the occurrence of emotions in certain category of products present in the market, 2) to apply this information to make strategic decisions when defining the emotional intentions for the new product, and 3) to focus their creative thinking to develop strong and meaningful emotion-centric ideas.",Alaniz T.; Biazzo S.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Computer Science,2019-01-01,Università degli Studi di Padova,Emotion-driven ;  Innovation ;  Product design

The Contribution of Participation Banks to the International Trade in Turkey: A Panel Data Analysis,"Innovations in the financial sector contribute to development of money and capital markets. When the financial sector expands, the real sector is also affected positively. Country economies can grow faster with driving force of financial markets. In fact, if the real sector extends abroad and foreign exchange flows into the country, the pressure on exchange rates can be alleviated. The emergence and development of Islamic finance can be considered as one of the financial innovations. A large amount of Islamic funds which are under the mattress, enter to financial markets through Islamic products and services. Participation banks which are the representative of Islamic finance in Turkey meet the funds needs of the real sector with the supply of funds. The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of Islamic banks on real sector and international trade. In this context, export was defined as a proxy of international trade and the impact of provided funds by participation banks on export was examined by panel data analysis. The dataset contains in 44 quarterly period over the years of 2008-2018. According to the results, the funds canalized into real sector by participation banks increase the export in Turkey. Even if there are numerous studies on the relationship between Islamic banks and economic growth, the studies about the effects of Islamic banks on international trade is limited availability.

The Mediating Roles of Solidarity and Intellectual Capital on the Relationship between Resource Dependency Sub-dimensions and Innovation Performance,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the mediator role of solidarity and intellectual capital elements within technocities on the relationship between resource dependency sub-dimensions and innovation performance. Research data's obtained from 234 participants who work in technocities were tested with structural equation model. Resource dependency dimensions, which are independent variables, were evaluated in two sub-dimensions; the importance of the resource (RIMP) and the availability of alternatives (AA). Uncertainty scale was evaluated in three sub-dimensions; ability to be a resource (AbiR), resource scarcity (RS) and resource interconnectedness (RINT). Mediating variables were planned as solidarity (SOL) and intellectual capital-human capital (H-C), social capital (S-C) and organizational capital (O-C)-The results of the analysis emphasized the importance of solidarity and intellectual capital in terms of dependency and uncertainty. In analyzing the mediation effects, three different models were tested and were determined to be parallel. The SOL and O-C dependents found to have a direct effect on the innovation performance (INP). According to Model 1; it can be stated that the RIMP has a direct and positive effect on INP, O-C and SOL. In the model 2; AA has a direct and positive effect on INP, O-C and SOL. In Model 3, the RINT has a direct effect on the INP, O-C and SOL.

Forecasting of innovation in the light of semantic networks,"The subject of this study is a strategic and competitive global innovation management. In this frame, a study was carried to reveal the dynamics of innovations from idea to product in three steps. In the first step, semantic network analysis was used in 400 papers with the highest citations published in 20 journals with the highest h5-index in the health field from 2013 to 2015. Web scraping and text mining tools based on R language were used to create semantic network structures. Semantic network analysis revealed that the focus of the articles was on cancer. The analysis carried out using the Sankey diagram revealed that scientists who work in cancer are most frequently involved in the lung, however, the scientists who related with the lung are not focused on treatment, and heart. The experts' comments are due to challenges in the treatment of the lung cancer scientist may be focused on areas like diagnosis and phases of cancer. In the second step, 260,000 rows of Clinical Trials cases were analyzed. In the third step, an analysis was made on a total of 1000 patent documents selected from the lens.org site, which contains the databases in global patent offices. Methods used in the analysis of the articles in the first step were carried out in these documents. According to this, diagnosis, treatment and therapy words the most common pass with lung cancer through the documents. In addition, the most cited authors in the field of lung cancer were searched in patent documents. These authors are considered as academic backgrounds that feed new technologies. According to this, it has been found that there are no major matches among the most cited authors of 400 papers and most cited authors in the patent documents in the field of lung cancer. It has been found that patents feed on more specific journals rather than major medical journals. In addition, it was also found that the most cited authors of 400 papers were different from the patent owners.",Baskici C.; Atan S.; Ercil Y.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Computer Science,2019-01-01,Başkent Üniversitesi;Agriculture and Rural Development Support Institution,Artificial intelligence ;  Socio-technological systems ;  Strategic technology forecasting ;  Text mining
What ecosystem model to support the creation of social innovation technopoles?,"Many innovative initiatives driven by young entrepreneurs engaged in the creation of high societal impact start-ups emerge. Benefiting from the exponential development of new technologies for social and environmental purposes leads to a reinvention of existing practices and working methods on several levels such as governance, management and entrepreneurship. Indeed, improving the life quality of citizens through efficient services that revolve around innovative digital devices would not happen without the development of a favorable environment to social innovation that would promote the creation of innovative startups and group them thereafter in technological clusters. Providing innovative solutions to the fundamental needs of the populations is the common goal between the social innovation technopoles. They represent an engine of growth for their economies as their business performance is based on social, environmental and economic development. The establishment of such ambitious projects would not success without a proper support on several levels as a qualified human resources, the investment funds, powerful universities, consulting firms, training organizations, management and regulation as well as a legal framework. The orderly conduct of the rise of social innovation technopoles implies the emergence of a social entrepreneurship ecosystem that combines knowledge and skills in order to face the institutional, financial and technical obstacles they may experience. Success factors of the social innovation technopoles are based on the level of the stakeholders' involvement on the ecosystem, the effectiveness of the implemented governance, the alignment with national vision and goals as well as the level of the international attractiveness of the technopoles. Taking into account that social innovation should be integrated at all social entrepreneurship ecosystem levels, how can we define the structure of the ecosystem and the possible relations between its stakeholders for the promotion, governance and support of the social innovation technopoles?",Znagui Z.; Rahmouni B.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Computer Science,2019-01-01,Université Hassan 1er;Faculty of Juridical,High societal impact start-ups ;  Social entrepreneurship ;  Social innovation technopoles

Strategic Entrepreneurial Awareness and Business Performance: Empirical Evidence from Small and Medium-sized Enterprises in Thailand,"Thailand 4.0 is the economic development model recently adopted by the government of Thailand. The model is based on the notion of industry 4.0 focusing on adding values to economic products and commodities using creativity and new innovation. Considering the Thailand 4.0 concept, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Thailand are facing a new challenge on exploiting changes and opportunities determining their business and survival. This paper studies characteristics of business entrepreneurship of these SMEs involving with the combination of taking risk and adopting new innovation. It theoretically employs the concept of strategic entrepreneurship awareness discussed in previous studies and literature on its essence in helping firms promote their entrepreneurial capability and business innovation. However, the substantial understanding and evidences of this strategic concept empirically employed in the Thailand context are still limited. This paper therefore fills in the gap by employing the concept for investigating strategic entrepreneurship awareness in Thai SMEs. Using quantitative research instruments, a conceptual model was developed to form research hypotheses involving elements of strategic entrepreneurship awareness. Given the model, there was a theoretical testing of firms' competitiveness, superior organizational innovation and outstanding business creativity and their relationships with the business performance. The population of this research is 3 million Thai SMEs. Mail-questionnaires were distributed to 1,805 registered Thai SMEs requesting a response from their managing director or managing partner. With 21.44% response rate, 387 completed questionnaires were used in the analysis using statistic techniques including VIFs, correlation analysis, and OLS regression analysis. The data analysis eventually delivered the examinations of the postulated hypotheses. By presenting the findings, this paper provides a new insight into the ways in which Thai SMEs are able to enhance their entrepreneurial orientation, perspectives and characteristics in order to achieve the higher-level performance, greater financial return and newer business innovation.",Sriboonlue P.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Computer Science,2019-01-01,Mahasarakham University,Business innovation ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Organizational Innovation ;  Strategic Entrepreneurship Awareness ;  Thailand 4.0
Towards Innovative SMEs: An Empirical Study of Regional Small and Medium Enterprises in Thailand,"This paper presents an empirical study of a Thai public university delivering its academic services to help regional SMEs in Thailand to move towards innovative entrepreneurship. This challenge of Thai SMEs is concerned with the current national development model known as Thailand 4.0. This development model is constructed following the industry 4.0 concept. The model has increased concerns among small firms required to enhance their creativity and innovation to create value-added businesses. This paper looks into the influence of the Thailand 4.0 concept on the development of regional small and medium enterprises (SMEs). It presents an empirical study of regional SMEs in the North-east region of Thailand trying to move towards innovative SME. The study employed mixed research methods. First, it employed strategic entrepreneurship concept to form a theoretical framework and research hypotheses. At this step, there was theoretical testing involving firm competitiveness, superior organizational innovation, and outstanding business creativity and their relationship with business performance. The researchers analyzed the quantitative data using statistic techniques, including VIFs, correlation analysis, and OLS regression analysis. At this step, the study was able to identify two essential components for SMEs performance and innovation, namely integrative new idea generation and market-leadership orientation. Given the initial results, the study then investigated the roles of universities in the promotion of regional SMEs performance and innovation. It focused on their contributions to integrative new idea generation and market-leadership orientation in the regional SMEs in particular. At this step, the research employed a qualitative case study using in-depth interviews for the data collection.

Avocado and Coffee Supply Chains Specialization in Colombia,"The specialization approach, understood as the process through which firms create specific knowledge and capabilities through learning, is an important factor to understand the voluntary effort they make to acquire the necessary capabilities to compete in a supply chain (SC). From this perspective, specialization is a complex phenomenon that emerges along with learning. Modelling and simulation have proven to be an appropriate methodology for the analysis of such phenomena. Nevertheless, existing models have limitations related to the characterization of their agents and market forces. To overcome these limitations, a characterization of supply chain agents related to coffee and avocado has been proposed based on their innovation capabilities. The objective was to diagnose the capabilities of the actors who compete and collaborate through interaction. The conclusion about the findings understood of how the actors specialize and learn in these supply chains and what their dynamics and behaviours are. It also served as a guide for the policies and strategies to improve the economic and innovative performance of these chains. In addition, through the analysis of the patterns of specialization in SC, it's shown that they have not accumulated their TCI and, as a result, there is a lack of competitiveness due to the limited adaptation to a competitive environment and satisfaction of market needs.",Ramirez S.; Sánchez B.; Jimenez S.; Castañeda W.; Ramirez D.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Computer Science,2019-01-01,Universidad Nacional de Colombia Medellin;Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana,Learning ;  Specialization ;  Suply Chains ;  Technological Capabilities for Innovation
An Investigation on the Volatility of Cryptocurrencies by means of Heterogeneous Panel Data Analysis,"Cryptocurrencies have emerged about ten years ago as a new form of currency and have attracted much attention since they depend on a fully decentralized system, and so their transactions are very fast and have zero transaction cost. Therefore, character of cryptocurrencies and their volatility have been discussed widely by investors, policymakers and economists in recent years. From this point of view, this study aims to explain the price volatility of cryptocurrencies with macro-financial indicators, and thereby, the effects of S&P 500 stock market index, gold price, oil price, 2-year benchmark US Bond interest rate and US Dollar index on the prices of four major cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Ripple, are investigated. The study comprises a panel data analysis applied to daily data over the period of August 2016-April 2019, and analysis results show that increases in gold price, oil price and S&P 500 index raise the prices of cryptocurrencies, while increases in 2-year benchmark US Bond interest rate and US Dollar index cause to a fall. This adverse effects of the US Dollar index and US Bond interest rate on the prices of cryptocurrencies indicates that when the value of US Dollar and US Bond yield decrease investors prefer to invest in cryptocurrencies as alternative investment instruments. On the other hand, cryptocurrencies move with a similar trend of stock market index, gold price and oil price which are overall market indicators. Thereby, findings of this study show that cryptocurrencies behave more like an investment instrument than a currency, and prices of these financial assets interact with significant macro-financial indicators.",İçellioǧlu C.; Öner S.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Computer Science,2019-01-01,Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa,Bitcoin ;  Cryptocurrency ;  Financial indicators ;  Financial innovation ;  Market volatility

Some Critical Issues in Innovation and Economic Development: Lessons from the Recent Turkish Experience,"In this article, selected critical characteristics of innovation based development are analyzed. In this context, some inputs of innovation, including R&D and education and strategic approaches are analyzed with the view of ""innovation based development."" The Turkish experience reveals that simply increasing the expenditures on inputs of innovation per se may not return as improvements in innovation. Particularly, making the necessary adjustments and management of details (fine-tuning effect) and components that feed innovation, as well as the general policies, such as, improving effectiveness of R&D expenditures and supports are key determinants of achieving innovation goals.

An empirical study to explore the interplay of Managerial and Operational capabilities to infuse organizational innovation in SMEs,"This study aims to explore and examine the relationship of managerial capability and operational capability to infuse organizational innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises by proposing and empirically validating a rigorous capability-based model. This study conceptualized managerial capability by considering decision making, management style, and people development whereas operational capability is conceptualized by considering process management and performance management under the umbrella of Resource-based view theory, dynamic capability and organizational capability perspective. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) is employed to test the model hypotheses and importance-performance map analysis (IPMA) provides information about the significance and relevance of the key dimensions of managerial and operational capability which explain and help to infuse organizational innovation. The empirical data is gathered through questionnaires distributed across 210 SMEs. The results exhibit strong and significant relationships among managerial capability, operational capability and organizational innovation where majority of the hypothesis are supported by the empirical results. The results are practical in nature as they may help SMEs to gain a holistic view of the relationship between managerial and operational capability and their influence on organizational innovation.",Ali Z.; Zwetsloot I.; Nada N.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Computer Science,2019-01-01,City University of Hong Kong;Ainovia,Managerial capability ;  Operational capability ;  Organizational innovation ;  PLS-SEM ;  SMEs
Research and Development Approaches and Implementation Issues in Agricultural Machinery Sector; Konya Case,"In Turkey, agricultural manufacturing plays a big role in industry as a sector and can produce almost all categories of agricultural equipment. When considered agricultural machinery sector, it is ranked as the 5th biggest machinery sector in Turkey, covering 7% of the total exports and in domestic market, agricultural machinery sector is ranked as 4th sector. From a regional point of view, it can be stated that İstanbul, Ankara, İzmir, Konya, AydIn, Manisa and BalIkesir regions are prominent in the sector in terms of both manufacturing volume and number of employments. However, when it comes to contribute and implement new technological developments, Turkey cannot perform adequately considering export-import balance. Most of the imports are especially the equipment possessing high technology. The lack of following trend technologies becomes a potential threat on the sector. A demand analysis questionnaire was conducted to understand the demands of SME's in agricultural machinery sector, which is the target group of 'Smart Technologies, Development, Design and Prototyping Center' that is planned to establish within our university. In this study, results of the survey that was implemented to capture current state of the overall approach to R&D applications and demand analysis in agricultural machinery sector in Konya, Turkey. In addition to the current picture, main impediments in process of technological transformation are confirmed by the results of demand analysis survey for the region. The demand analysis clearly revealed that almost 60% of the companies participating in the survey believe that there are problems in the current state of the sector; whereas another additional 10% considers the future of the sector being in jeopardy. Main problems are defined as Lack of skilled labour, Insufficient R&D activities by considering low awareness of R&D and SMEs' inability to develop and conduct R&D projects and Lack of effective University-Industry Collaboration.",Eryürük Ş.; Nesimioǧlu B.; Altun H.; Açikgöz H.; Yumusąk S.; Yildiz H.; Cąlik A.; Ethem Baǧriyanik O.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Computer Science,2019-01-01,Karatay Üniversitesi,Agricultural Machinery ;  Demand Analysis ;  Innovation ;  R&D ;  Smart Technologies Center
"The causal relationship between innovation, competitiveness and foreign trade in developed and developing countries","In this paper, we examine the causal relations between competitiveness, innovation and foreign trade for 31 developed and 26 developing countries using panel causality analysis between 2007 and 2017. Global competitiveness, global innovation, information and communication technologies, development indices and annual export rates of countries are selected as variables for analysis. We first test for cross sectional dependence, the result of which proves that there is cross sectional dependence. Following this, we apply the Dumitrescu and Hurlin panel causality analysis, which takes into account the correlation between cross sections. According to the results of the Dumitrescu and Hurlin panel causality test, unidirectional causality is detected from export to innovation and information-communication technology, from information-communication technology to competitiveness in both developed and developing countries. Unlike the developed country group results, the developing country group findings show unidirectional causality from competitiveness to export and from innovation to competitiveness. These findings suggest that foreign trade dynamics are different in developed and developing countries.",Sener S.; Delican D.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Computer Science,2019-01-01,Istanbul Üniversitesi,Export ;  Foreign trade ;  Global competitiveness ;  Innovation
Evaluation of Data Sharing in Production Firms and Innovation Orientation in the Effect of Management Capability on Operational Performance,"The aim of this study is to investigate and analyze the effects of information sharing on the operational performance of technology companies in the competitive environment in the management skills and innovative focus of the firms in the technology sector. Due to the limitations of the research, only the technology firms formed our sample group and we can give the analysis results only through the technology companies. The sample population of the research should also be considered in terms of the intensive technology-oriented industrial firms. A research model has been developed to examine the relationships between variables and to test hypotheses. The data obtained from the collected 312 questionnaires were responded by the engineers working in 28 technology companies. In particular, because of the fact that the sample population is engineers, they have taken part in our research because they assume important duties and responsibilities in both the operational part and in the innovation orientation.

Crowdfunding Awareness in Turkey,"There are many obstacles to innovation in today's world. To find required financial resource for carrying out an innovative project is probably at the top of these obstacles. Conventional financial institutions such as banks, venture capital firms and investment banks accept innovative projects as very risky and they are unwilling to fund innovative projects. As a result of this reality, crowdfunding has been growing rapidly in the world as an alternative way to support innovative projects based on the development of communication technologies. Crowdfunding is an alternative financial tool, which enables project owners to fund their projects without needing banks or other conventional financial institutions. Crowdfunding platforms have been transformed into an area where innovative approaches and products are able to be exhibited worldwide. Therefore, it is important to know and use the crowdfunding model directly or indirectly in implementation of innovative projects. By following this motivation, we conduct a quantitative research to measure level of crowdfunding awareness and to analyze the potential relationship between innovativeness and crowdfunding in Turkey. Our survey results indicate that level of crowdfunding awareness is still low in Turkey. Results of our logit models also prove a significant positive relationship between being innovative and intention to use crowdfunding approach. Innovative people are eager to support projects offered on crowdfunding platforms in Turkey. For the crowdfunding field, understanding this strong relationship would lead policy makers to place special emphasis on innovativeness.",Sirma İ.; Ekici O.; Aytürk Y.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Computer Science,2019-01-01,Istanbul Üniversitesi,Awareness ;  Crowdfunding ;  Innovation ;  Innovativeness ;  Turkey
An Innovative Technology: Augmented Reality Based Information Systems,"In our generation the information systems evolve with new technologies: Augmented reality (AR), IoT, artificial intelligence, blockchain etc. Anymore they perform information exchange by sensors. It is estimated that the systems will be in a state of extreme interaction and reach 50 billion devices connected in Internet in 2020. We know that everything around us will be in interaction and they will do everything without any need of human interference. For example, when our dishwasher is full, it will start to wash automatically, or when the run out of the gasoline, our car will drive to the nearest station, or even when a burglar is entered to our house, it will automatically be detected and be announced to the police office. In business life, the processes will be automatical in maximum level and this technology will increase productivity and efficiency. Next to mobile technology, it is thought that these new generation information systems (IS) will take the biggest place in our lives. AR also will be integrated to these systems to augment the information in real world. Humanity will augment its habitat in an innovative way thanks to these AR based IS. This paper surveys the current state-of-the-art AR systems related with aerospace & defense, industry, education, medical and gaming sectors.

"Innovative strategies, monitoring and analysis of the coastal erosion risk: The stimare project","Coastal erosion processes are often due to inappropriate coastal defense strategies. The construction of infrastructures that interfere with the coastal circulation and the sediment transport along the coast (piers, docks, etc.), the destruction of the dunes and other anthropogenic modifications to the beach, are some of the factors that limit the adaptability of the beach system and amplify the risk of erosion and flooding of the coastal land. Coastal defense interventions have historically been based on the construction of rigid works (seawalls, groins, breakwaters, jetties, etc.), which, while protecting the territory, have often shifted the problem of erosion to the neighboring coasts. The paper will present the contents and the first findings of the research project STIMARE (Innovative strategies, monitoring and analysis of the coastal erosion risk), financed by the Italian Ministry of the Environment and the Sea (MATTM), aimed to define strategies for coastal management, based on a strong involvement of the stakeholders, and on the use of innovative or low-costs technologies for coastal monitoring. Methodology is based on data acquisition, numerical modelling, laboratory tests, physical and ecological monitoring. All the information and results will be discussed with the local stakeholders, in order to provide a comprehensive strategy for coastal protection, following the European Marine Strategy framework. The Project involves researchers from two important Universities in Italy (University of Bologna and Politecnico di Bari) and has a strong interdisciplinary approach, involving coastal engineers, urban planners, geologists, ecologists and mechanical engineers.",Archetti R.; Damiani L.; Bianchini A.; Romagnoli C.; Abbiati M.; Addona F.; Airoldi L.; Cantelli L.; Gaeta M.; Guerrero M.; Pellegrini M.; Saccani C.; Barbanente A.; Saponieri A.; Simeone V.; Tarantino E.; Bruno M.; Doglioni A.; Motta Zanin G.; Pratola L.; Molfetta M.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference,2019-01-01,Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna;Politecnico di Bari,Coastal management ;  Harbour siltation ;  Innovation ;  Monitoring ;  Unconventional coastal structures
Does biotechnology pose new catastrophic risks?,"Advances in biotechnology in the twenty-first century, fueled in large part by the field of synthetic biology, have greatly accelerated capabilities to manipulate and re-program bacteria, viruses, and other organisms. These genetic engineering capabilities are driving innovation and progress in drug manufacturing, bioremediation, and tissue engineering, as well as biosecurity preparedness. However, biotechnology is largely dual use, holding the potential of misuse for deliberate harm along with positive applications; defenses against those threats need to be anticipated and prepared. This chapter describes the challenges of managing dual-use capabilities enabled by modern biotechnology and synthetic biology and highlights a framework tool developed by a National Academies committee to aid analysis of the security effects of new scientific discoveries and prioritization of concerns. The positive aspects of synthetic biology in preparedness are also detailed, and policy directions are highlighted for taking advantage of the positive aspects of these emerging technologies while minimizing risks.",DiEuliis D.; Ellington A.; Gronvall G.; Imperiale M.,Book Series,Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology,2019-01-01,"National Defense University;University of Michigan, Ann Arbor;The University of Texas at Austin;Johns Hopkins University",
Impact of Individual's Cooperative Behaviors on Innovation: Evidence from China,"This paper explores individual's role in the innovation process of firms by determining staff members' openness to engage in cooperative behaviors with their peers in the Chinese context, and subsequently, the impact of those interactions on the perceptions of trust among colleagues, and how those links influence the innovation capability of firms. Also, we size the extent to which employees' years of experience can moderate those relations. Questionnaire responses derived from employees in Chinese technology-driven firms were used to perform the statistical analysis and test the hypotheses drawn in this study. The individual's engagement in cooperative behaviors was proven to be rather unbiased among colleagues. Likewise, those dynamics led to positive perceptions of trust among them and added to the innovation capability of firms while an individual's years of experience didn't influence those dynamics. The present article examined two knowledge-sharing approaches used to ease cooperative behaviors among staff members. However, it is also necessary to examine the influence of other approaches in order to generate more precise comparisons of the frameworks that can yield better results. It is suggested that Chinese firms adopt a more reflexive learning approach that would facilitate individual's engagement in cooperative behavior that lead to innovation. These results can be useful for managers in industries such as software-engineering and product-design which depend heavily on the effective transmission of knowledge among staff.",Torres O.; Liang D.,Journal,Journal of Integrated Design and Process Science,2019-01-01,Harbin Institute of Technology,China ;  Cooperative behaviors ;  innovation capability ;  knowledge sharing ;  oswaldojim@gmail.com

Software architecture solutions for the internet of things: A taxonomy of existing solutions and vision for the emerging research,"Recently, Internet of Thing (IoT) systems enable an interconnection between systems, humans, and services to create an (autonomous) ecosystem of various computation-intensive things. Software architecture supports an effective modeling, specification, implementation, deployment, and maintenance of software-intensive things to engineer and operationalize IoT systems. In order to conceptualize and optimize the role of software architectures for IoTs, there is a dire need for research efforts to analyse the existing research and solutions to formulate the vision for futuristic research and development. In this research, we propose to empirically analyse and taxonomically classify the impacts of research on designing, architecting, and developing IoT-driven software systems. We have conducted a survey-based study of the existing research - investigating challenges, solutions and required futuristic efforts - on architecting IoT systems. The results of survey highlight that software architecture solutions support various research themes for IoT systems such as (i) cloud-based ecosystems, (ii) reference architectures, (ii) autonomous systems, and (iv) agent-based systems for IoT-based software. The results also indicate that any futuristic vision to architect IoT software should incorporate architectural processes, patterns, models and languages to support reusable, automated, and efficient development of IoTs.

"Nanotechnology in orthodontics-1: The past, present, and a perspective of the future","Nanotechnology continues to influence new developments within numerous engineering and medical disciplines and its adaptation into the future advancements of orthodontics has already begun. For example, nanoindentation studies with atomic force microscope are being utilized to effectively image and analyze the surface properties and changes taking place on orthodontic wires and brackets during treatment at the nanoscale dimension. Nanoparticle coatings on orthodontic archwires have been evaluated to reduce friction and, if further developed, could influence the speed and/or efficiency of tooth movement. In other research, orthodontic adhesives with nanoparticles have been shown to have improved material characteristics over the conventional adhesives. While some initial studies have evaluated the use of fluoride delivery via orthodontic elastomeric ligatures, additional studies on nanoparticle delivery of anticariogenic, antiinflammatory, and antimicrobial medicaments using orthodontic elastomeric ligatures could provide valuable innovations in the field of orthodontics. This chapter discusses recent studies over the past decade on applications of nanoparticles, nanoscale imaging techniques, and their applications in orthodontics. Future directions on research about shape-memory polymers for orthodontic wires, biological microelectromechanical systems/nanoelectromechanical systems, temporary anchorage devices, and nanorobots for orthodontic applications are discussed.",Subramani K.; Subbiah U.; Huja S.,Book,Nanobiomaterials in Clinical Dentistry,2019-01-01,Sree Balaji Dental College & Hospital;Roseman University of Health Sciences;College of Medicine,Archwires ;  Brackets ;  Nanocoatings ;  Nanomaterials ;  Orthodontics
Undertaking: A business game for 21<sup>st</sup>-century undergraduate skills,"The purpose of this research was to assess students’ perceptions of learning effectiveness of a board game having synergy with a business simulator. The game teaches students how to integrate interdisciplinary knowledge while developing “21st-century skills” like collaboration, communication, information literacy, decision-making, and problem-solving. “Interactive cognitive complexity theory” suggests that interactive games are more effective than other instructional methods because they simultaneously engage students' affective and cognitive processes. (Tennyson & Jorczak, 2008). Board games are enjoyable and promote team collaboration and communication. On one hand, board game scenarios and premises are very dissimilar to business realities, on the other hand, business simulators are useful in developing decision-making, problem-solving, and information literacy skills, but their formats on computer screens may seem cold and distant. This project extracts the best features of both board games and business simulators to create an exci ting learning experience in a new game called “Undertaking.” Qualitative research was conducted using post-game interviews with 130 students. Then, a pre-game and post-game surveys were designed and tested based on validated scales for 21st-century skills (Chai et al., 2015; Cevik, 2019; Soh, Osman & Arsad, 2012). The quantitative data will be gathered with pre-game and post-game surveys applied to 150 students during November 2019. The participants of the research are business undergraduate freshmen students at the Guadalajara campus of Tecnologico de Monterrey (ITESM) in Mexico. The qualitative and first quantitative data demonstrated the positive impact of Undertaking on the students’ perceptions of their 21st-century competencies. After the game, students reported a better understanding of how to solve problems, make decisions, communicate and, work collaboratively among others.",Camacho C.; Sahu S.; Esteva E.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the European Conference on Games-based Learning,2019-01-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,21st century skills ;  Board games ;  Business simulations ;  Educational innovation ;  Game-based learning ;  Higher education
Enterprise Architecture Oriented Requirements Engineering for Open Data Usage in Schools,"Open Data has been considered as a key to scientific innovations. These openly licensed data-sets can be accessed, used, rebuild, and shared by anyone and anywhere. Mostly, Open Data is discussed in relation to its production, storage, licensing and accessibility, but less often - in relation to its practical subsequent uses, e.g. as an educational resource. In general, Open Data can be used as an open educational resource to develop transversal skills among school students. This paper presents an Enterprise Architecture Oriented Requirements Engineering (EAORE) approach for Open Data usage as an educational resource in Danish public schools. The aim of this research work is to identify requirements of Danish public schools for the development of an Open Data interface. The EAORE approach represents how Enterprise Architecture (EA) models guide overall Requirements Engineering (RE) process for Open Data usage in Danish public schools.",Saddiqa M.; Kirikova M.; Pedersen J.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing,2019-01-01,Riga Technical University;Aalborg University,Educational resource ;  Enterprise architecture ;  Open Data ;  Open Data interface ;  Requirements engineering
A study on the application of additional acoustic for improving of the electric fan function,"Electric fans, which are only used in summer, are now demanding a new paradigm.

Recent advances in developing and applying biosensors for synthetic biology,"Biosensors are an indispensable component of the synthetic biologist’s toolbox. Informed by biology and customized through rational design and evolutionary methods, these molecular protein scaffolds translate input signals into tractable outputs. By using biosensors to introduce synthetic gene circuits and cellular signaling pathways into host organisms, naturally-occurring biological processes can be harnessed and tailored for a wide range of applications. In this review, we have compiled recent innovations and advancements that have led to the generation of robust, reliable, and flexible biosensors for utility across basic biological research and synthetic biology tools, including biological engineering efforts and clinical applications.",Jones K.; Zinkus-Boltz J.; Dickinson B.,Journal,Nano Futures,2019-01-01,The University of Chicago,Biosensors ;  Chemical biology ;  Directed evolution ;  Synthetic biology
Multiphoton Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of astrocytes with genetically encoded indicators delivered by a viral approach,"Decades of research have unraveled the complex functioning of neurons in the central nervous system. Our knowledge of the second main player of the brain – the non-excitable glial cells – clearly lags behind that of neurons. Pioneering work in the 1990s provided evidence that star-shaped glial cells – astrocytes – sense and modulate neuronal activity by intracellular Ca2+ signals. However, the precise roles of astrocytic Ca2+ signaling in brain physiology and pathophysiology are still highly controversial, largely due to technical limitations of previous Ca2+ imaging tools. With recent innovations in laser microscopy and engineering of molecular probes, the field of glioscience is undergoing a revolution. This chapter describes the application of multiphoton microscopy and genetically encoded fluorescent Ca2+ indicators to reveal astrocytic Ca2+ signals in acute brain slices and in vivo, both in anesthetized and in awake behaving animals.",Enger R.; Sprengel R.; Nagelhus E.; Tang W.,Book Series,Neuromethods,2019-01-01,Oslo Universitetssykehus;Universität Heidelberg;Universitetet i Oslo,Astrocytes ;  Ca  signaling 2+ ;  GCaMP6 ;  GECI ;  Genetically encoded calcium indicator ;  Glia ;  Raav gene transduction ;  Two-photon microscopy
Sand filled geotextile containers in Australia - Is there a future?,"Australia was an early adopter of sand filled geotextile/geosynthetics containers (SFGC) for coastal structures and has been a global leader in application and the R&D of the technology. Large engineered “sandbags” were a natural progression from the small sandbags used, and still used, very effectively despite their low mass, for emergency wave erosion. The SFGC technology has optimum applications and positive drivers for their use include: • Increasing shortage and increasing cost of good quality rock. • Suitability for emergency and temporary protection works. • Providing soft, user friendly and safer structures for longer term works in high recreational use areas. • Suitability for low crested structures. • Environmental benefits as the geotextile provides a good substrate for marine growth. Up to the early 2000's the technology evolved rapidly facilitating innovative projects. However, the use of SFGC in Australia appears to be declining due to a number of issues including: • Design; Being “soft” and flexible structures, they are more difficult to design for stability compared to traditional materials. • The R&D and monitoring to date has provided a good understanding of failure modes and product-specific guidelines but there are still no comprehensive and widely accepted design guidelines such as the Rock Manual for rock. • Construction; Contractors have tried, often unsuccessfully, to apply rock construction methods to SFGC structures resulting in construction delays, cost escalations and structural failures. • Durability; Being relatively thin skinned and vulnerable to UV exposure, the life of the units and structure can be short, if not well designed, protected and maintained. Research into materials continues but the last significant improvement in material durability was in 2000 for Narrowneck reef. Conclusion: The future widespread use of SFGC technology will depend on improved guidelines for design and construction as well as innovative development of more durable materials.",Jackson L.; Corbett B.,Conference Proceeding,Australasian Coasts and Ports 2019 Conference,2019-01-01,International Coastal Management,Climate change ;  Coastal structures ;  Durability ;  Geotextile ;  Innovation

The Future Exchange of Digital Engineering Data and Models: An Enterprise Systems Analysis,"In the process of the Defense Department's Digital Engineering transformation, a series of innovation programs and challenges will need to be sponsored that lead to an evolutionary transformation of the defense engineering and acquisition enterprise. The DoD should pursue a set of development/investment opportunities in the areas that have the most impact on short and long term transformative change. A critical innovation impact area is the process of digital information exchange. In a study to address this transformation process, we used the systemigram method to create a conceptual model of a likely future digital information exchange process emerging from the department's strategy. The systemigram process creates a holistic view of the outcomes of enterprise change for the stakeholders, who usually only have a small part of the system in their mental models. The systemigram was presented and validated at a Digital Information Exchange Working Group meeting attended by a broad group of government and industry stakeholders. The meeting and accompanying discussions started a process of community agreement on terminology and innovation needs surrounding the exchange of digital system information. This paper presents that systemigram model and discusses the outcomes of the community discussion. For those interested in the future information exchange process, the systemigram provides a first look at the end-to-end business process that should emerge from DoD Digital Engineering initiatives and strategy. For innovators, the systemigram provides a number of opportunity spaces that might be pursued.",McDermott T.; Collopy P.; Nadolski M.; Paredis C.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Computer Science,2019-01-01,Stevens Institute of Technology;Clemson University;The University of Alabama in Huntsville;Georgia Institute of Technology,Digital Engineering ;  Digital information exchange ;  Enterprise Transformation ;  Systemigram
Trello as virtual learning environment and active learning organiser for PBL classes: An analysis under Bloom's Taxonomy,"Trello is a cloud app based on Kanban concept and also available for desktop mobile devices. The app has plenty of boards that help projects' development under SCRUM concept. Trello is not originally designed as a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) but it is recurrently adopted by one of the paper authors as a VLE for Project-Based Learning (PBL) classes development. It is also used as a formative assessment platform. The present research brings a case study under Trello point of view about a PBL class from a specialisation program named Creativity & Innovation where students chose to develop a project related to a vegan pizza bike entrepreneur in a Brazilian Applied Science Institute. The students from this PBL class came from distinct study areas like Graphic Design, Business Administration, Social Communication, and Journalism as well as Production Engineering since the program has an interdisciplinary character. Active Learning was the core learning approach taking PBL as a framework for it. According to the methodology, the students collaboratively identified the steps for project development from the “pizza bike” to the business areas related to it. For instance: visual identity, digital marketing, financial and accountability, manufacturing, etc. After that, the students supported by a tutor proposed teams for each areas identifying team tasks. From the beginning until the last activity, Trello as a VLE was disruptively essential for project organisation as well as their project success. A model based on Bloom's Taxonomy and other authors were proposed for the results analysis and it was possible to conclude that Trello as an innovative VLE and PBL organiser seemed to be positive from the author´s/tutor´s perception to the students' feedback and project results.",Uebe Mansur A.; Alves A.; Torres R.,Conference Proceeding,International Symposium on Project Approaches in Engineering Education,2019-01-01,"Instituto Federal de Educação, Ciência e Tecnologia Fluminense – IFFluminense;Universidade do Minho",Active Learning ;  Bloom's Taxonomy ;  Cloud Education ;  PBL ;  Trello ;  Virtual Learning Environment

Readiness of technical university students to entrepreneurship activity,"The article raises the problem of the formation of entrepreneurial competencies in response to the current situation in the country's economy, which arose due to the lack of specialists capable of organizing innovation and technology business in the Territories of advanced socio-economic development (TOSED). The authors have analyzed the professional preferences of graduates of the National Research Tomsk Polytechnic University (Russia), the University of Zagreb (Croatia), and the University of Lyon (France) and identified the reasons why graduates do not create their own business. In order to determine the necessary cluster of entrepreneurial competencies of university graduates with basic technical education, a survey involving the representatives of Russian and foreign companies working in Russia, including TOSED residents, was conducted. As a result, the authors have received a list of key entrepreneurial competencies necessary for entrepreneurial activities and the formation of graduate competence in the field of management and business. The authors believe that for the formation of entrepreneurial competence, certain conditions must be created in the educational process for preparing a student for entrepreneurial activities, in particular a number of disciplines (entrepreneurship, technological entrepreneurship, project management, business planning) should be included in the curricula; interactive design training methods aimed to develop graduate's readiness to create their own business should be applied.

More is less - The integral mass timber bridge,"Today, few new bridges are made of timber. Since the industrialization, timber bridges have increasingly lost ground to steel and later concrete bridges. In addition, timber bridges developed a reputation of high maintenance and low durability from many crossings built between the 1970s and 1990s. Interest in timber bridges has recently grown due to new motivations in design, including an increased focus on sustainability. Efforts in research and engineering to reexamine timber bridges have led to the development of the “Integral mass-timber bridge”. The bridges will be a first: timber integral bridges without any movement joints or bearings between the superstructure and the concrete abutments. These structures were developed taking into account the efficient use of natural resources as well as the carbon-emissions during the entire life span of the bridge: from the design and manufacturing to maintenance and operation. The body of the bridge is made of block-laminated timber beams and articulates the guiding principle of mass timber: the sequestration of carbon within the massive timber construction. Currently, the first three of these bridges are being constructed in Germany, with completion in May 2019. The concept has been awarded with the German Timber Construction Award 2017.",Helbig T.; Riederer J.; Meier F.; Rieser C.,Conference Proceeding,"20th Congress of IABSE, New York City 2019: The Evolving Metropolis - Report",2019-01-01,Knippershelbig GmbH,Bridge ;  Fiber reinforced concrete ;  Glued laminated timber ;  Innovation ;  Mass timber ;  Pedestrian bridge ;  Sustainability ;  Textile reinforced concrete ;  Timber ;  Timber bridge
Effects of problem formulation on engineering innovativeness,"Any building project requires the formulation of boundary conditions and expectations, the so-called problem formulation. Hereby, quality and scope of the problem formulation significantly set the frame for innovative and sustainable solutions by structural engineers. While recent problem formulation research scrutinized strategic organizational issues, this paper focuses on problem formulation influencing the work of structural engineers from two aspects: (1) who is responsible for the problem formulation and (2) what is the quality and scope of the problem formulation (does it describe qualities of the expected result or define the structure quantitatively?). Depending on these aspects, the problem formulation restricts the solution space of the engineer to a greater or lesser degree, opening the question whether an optimal degree of freedom to foster engineering innovativeness exists. Three explorative case studies are examined for this purpose: (1) the Elbphilharmonie, an architectural icon, characterized through strong interplay between client and architect; (2) the European Central Bank premises, a high-rise with an integral architecture-engineering-concept that emerged from an extensive competition; (3) the Gänsebachtalbrücke, an engineering structure, influenced significantly by an audit authority. After a brief introduction to problem formulation research and a description of the methodology, a storyline for each case is presented. The initial problem formulations, the problem formulators, the approaches to solve the problem as well as the solution space are analyzed. The cases indicate that to develop innovative structural designs, the structural engineers should be integrated early in the project to be able to shape and participate in the problem formulation process. A functional problem formulation and a collaborative approach of all designing actors to solve it can spur innovativeness. However, more research on this topic is recommended to confirm the findings of this exploratory paper.",Ruge J.; Fahnenmueller L.; Boegle A.,Conference Proceeding,"20th Congress of IABSE, New York City 2019: The Evolving Metropolis - Report",2019-01-01,HafenCity University Hamburg;Hamburg University of Technology,Innovation ;  Large-Scale Projects ;  Problem Formulation ;  Qualitative Research ;  Structural Design

Flame retardant epoxy composites on the road of innovation: An analysis with flame retardancy index for future development,"Nowadays, epoxy composites are elements of engineering materials and systems. Although they are known as versatile materials, epoxy resins suffer from high flammability. In this sense, flame retardancy analysis has been recognized as an undeniable requirement for developing future generations of epoxy-based systems. A considerable proportion of the literature on epoxy composites has been devoted to the use of phosphorus-based additives. Nevertheless, innovative flame retardants have coincidentally been under investigation to meet market requirements. This review paper attempts to give an overview of the research on flame retardant epoxy composites by classification of literature in terms of phosphorus (P), non-phosphorus (NP), and combinations of P/NP additives. A comprehensive set of data on cone calorimetry measurements applied on P-, NP-, and P/NP-incorporated epoxy systems was collected and treated. The performance of epoxy composites was qualitatively discussed as Poor, Good, and Excellent cases identified and distinguished by the use of the universal Flame Retardancy Index (FRI). Moreover, evaluations were rechecked by considering the UL-94 test data in four groups as V0, V1, V2, and nonrated (NR). The dimensionless FRI allowed for comparison between flame retardancy performances of epoxy composites. The results of this survey can pave the way for future innovations in developing flame-retardant additives for epoxy.",Movahedifar E.; Vahabi H.; Saeb M.; Thomas S.,Journal,Molecules,2019-01-01,Université Paris-Saclay;Université de Lorraine;Mahatma Gandhi University;Institute for Color Science and Technology;Amirkabir University of Technology,Cone calorimetry ;  Epoxy ;  Fire retardancy ;  Flame Retardancy Index (FRI)
"Embedded fiber-optic sensing for low-cost, high resolution monitoring in bridges and critical structures","Under a collaboration led and funded by VicTrack, VicRoads, and other Victorian State agencies with funding from the Victoria Public Sector Innovation Fund (PSIF) in Australia, the Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) and University of Melbourne (UoM) are developing Fibridge (overseen by a Project Governance Board chaired by VicTrack), a fiber-optic (FO) smart monitoring system for bridges to enable predictive maintenance using the industrial internet of things (IIoT). The system uses FO sensors attached to bridge structures to accurately measure and estimate parameters indicative of bridge state online, such as structural strain, thermal response, bending moments, shear/impact loads, and corrosion. Fibridge leverages PARC's low-cost, high-resolution, compact wavelength-shift detection technology and intelligent algorithms in combination with UoM and the stakeholder team's structural engineering know-how to enable effective real-time monitoring, performance management, better reliability, improved safety, and optimized bridge design. While Fibridge is initially targeting road and rail bridges, it will be extendable to other structures with similar maintenance/monitoring pain points. Here we present an overview of the project, enabling technologies, and summarize key results on vehicle load and structural response features detectable, bridge state estimation algorithm development, low-cost optical readout development, and validation test results. An initial proof-of-concept demonstration on a VicRoads highway bridge in Melbourne being monitored with FO sensors has shown promise thus far. At this stage, the technology is being scaled up towards an extended pilot trial on multiple rail, road, and transit bridges in Victoria. A business case for Fibridge to enable cost-effective maintenance is also summarized.",Raghavan A.; Arakaki K.; Hong Y.; Kiesel P.; Nguyen T.; Tuan N.; Stojkovic D.,Conference Proceeding,Structural Health Monitoring 2019: Enabling Intelligent Life-Cycle Health Management for Industry Internet of Things (IIOT) - Proceedings of the 12th International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring,2019-01-01,Palo Alto Research Center Incorporated;University of Melbourne;VicTrack,
Structural health monitoring (SHM) innovation or novelty-the move to fleet level SHM,"Is the time now? When will SHM transition from a novelty to a decision support platform for Bridge Asset Management. Structural Health Monitoring has been used on major bridges and as a research tool for over 50 years. The instances of its application for long term continuous monitoring are in the 100's. During this period the condition of the world's inventory of bridges has steadily declined. Many industry experts are citing the need for better information to manage bridges in a more productive manner. The industry needs to transition to fact based decision making from engineering judgement based on visual inspection. Do those conditions exist now? How will the industry need to adapt to allow for mainstream implementation of measured performance and a timeline for this innovation. This talk will address the technical, organizational and economic requirements for SHM to become a true innovation and be put into successful and practical use as a tool for managing a bridge fleet over their life cycle. The technological state of SHM as of a couple of years ago and the application of internet of things (IoT) technology to structural health monitoring will be discussed. The minimization of required hardware and decentralized data management are some of the major innovations IoT brings to SHM. A case study involving the continuous monitoring of a fleet of 20 bridges is presented. Field data examples using live loads from traffic to estimate load distribution factors are shown. In addition histograms of traffic induced strains on simply supported short and medium span bridge are presented. Examples are presented of timber, prestressed concrete and steel girder bridges. In summary, continuous monitoring a fleet of bridges is now economically and technologically viable.

Developing innovation technology capacities in large manufacturing firms from Mexico,"In Mexico, innovation has developed disproportionately among its states. For its part, the state of Nuevo Leon has carried out activities in favor of innovation which have been differentiated as an innovative state in comparison with the other entities that make up our country. However, several experts with a greater number of research centers and a high budget devoted to science, technology and innovation activities have paid less attention to human resources. The present investigation seeks to demonstrate that factors have a positive impact on the technological innovation capacity of human capital. The above, based on the premise that the level of innovation, both of nations and industries, is directly related to the ability of human resources to innovate. It is important to clarify that when referring to the term technological innovation, it is limited to the development of new or improved products or processes.

Reducing the impact of transport machinery and equipment on the environment during reforestation: An innovative approach,"The use of innovations in forest landscape restoration is necessary for the engineers and researchers collaboration. The integration of scientific and technical research and engineering design contributes to the early achievement of stringent environmental requirements for the engines of transport vehicles and tools. An example of cooperation between the Voronezh State University of Forestry and Technologies with LLC SPA â€œTALISâ€, St. Petersburg is one of the possible solutions in the field of rational reduction of energy costs in soil cultivation and sowing of forest seeds. The cooling system of the power plant is improved by intelligent control taking into account the thermal and aerodynamic characteristics of the thermal media. Improvement of energy and ecological parameters of the gun is carried out due to application in a design of an innovative wave disk. The use of an innovative approach to reduce the negative impact on the environment with fast reforestation will reduce the time spent in the design of modern tools, to carry out rational planning of works on the site preparation, to compensate for financial costs of maintenance of tools and overspending of fuels and lubricants, to accelerate the withdrawal to the international market of competitive products with a sparing impact on forest ecosystems. However, some questions remain unresolved: what is the impact on the energy balance of the process of sowing the rheological properties of the soil?

Assessment of the market and economic potential of a rotary steerable system,"In the context of external economic restrictions, Russia intensified state support of domestic developments for the drilling market. In this area there are both research projects and technological start-ups focused on the implementation of innovative technologies in production and treatment of raw hydrocarbon materials. This fact favorably influences prospects of development of the domestic rotary steerable system (RSS) market. The RSS has advantages such as oil production at the bottom of the sea, exclusion of negative impact on the environment and others. The results obtained during the tests of Gazpromneft wells are really impressive. During the construction of wells using the new technology, it was possible to reduce the drilling cycle by an average of 2-3 days, thereby significantly reducing the total cost of drilling. The specialists of Gazpromneft predict a decrease in the time for drilling by 10-15%, reducing energy consumption by 5-10%, reducing the number of used drilling mud and chemicals by 15-20%.This paper presents an analysis of RSS as a segment of the oilfield services market. The tendencies in the market of engineering support for horizontal and directional drilling and related segments of the market of oilfield services and equipment production are indicated in the research. Implementation of innovations requires competent decisions of investors such as the state and large industrial partners. In this connection, the qualitative analysis of the market and determination of economic potential of such projects come to the forefront. Usually, the results of evaluation of economic effectiveness of a project are expressed in a calculated net present value (NPV). Risk assessment of innovative products becomes a significant problem in conditions of heightened uncertainty. The authors show mathematical tools and confirm the reliability of planned results on the basis of Monte Carlo method. Outputs of simulation and data analysis with descriptive statistics allowed creating more realistic forecasts for investment decisions for the horizontal drilling market and RSS.",Akhmetova M.; Turbakov M.; Elokhova I.; Krutova A.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 33rd International Business Information Management Association Conference, IBIMA 2019: Education Excellence and Innovation Management through Vision 2020",2019-01-01,Perm National Research Polytechnic University,Drilling ;  Energy strategy ;  Investment ;  Monte Carlo Method ;  Net Present Value ;  Rotary Steerable System
"Challenges, approaches and solutions in data integration for research and innovation","In order to be implemented by policy makers, science, technology, and innovation (science, technology, and innovation (STI)) policies and indicator building need data. Whenever we need data, we need a method for data management, and in the era of big data big data, a crucial role is played by data integration big dataintegration. Therefore, STI policies and indicator development need data integration. Two main approaches to data integration exist, namely procedural and declarative. In this chapter, we follow the latter approach and focus our attention on the ontology-based data integration (ontology-based dataintegration (OBDI)) paradigm. The main principles of OBDI are: (i)Leave the data where they are.(ii)Build a conceptual specification of the domain of interest (ontology), in terms of knowledge structures.(iii)Map such knowledge structures to concrete data sources.(iv)Express all services over the abstract representation.(v)Automatically translate knowledge services to data services. We introduce the main challenges of data integration for research and innovation (researchand innovation (R&I)) and show that reasoning over an ontology connected to data may be very helpful for the study of R&I. We also provide examples by using Sapientia, an ontology specifically defined for multidimensional research assessment.",Lenzerini M.; Daraio C.,Book Series,Springer Handbooks,2019-01-01,Sapienza Università di Roma,data integration ;  knowledge representation and reasoning ;  ontology engineering ;  ontology languages ;  research and innovation

Why do academics engage locally? Insights from the University of Stavanger,"The role of individual actors in knowledge-exchange collaborations has been accorded much importance. Through their involvement with industry, innovation is especially enacted in their regions. Motivations for academic engagement have been fairly researched but academics’ motivations for local collaborations remain to be properly understood. The aim of this paper is therefore, to explore the motivations of academics for regional engagement. This exploration is done by drawing on empirical data collected through interviews with 16 academics in the Engineering Faculty of the University of Stavanger (UiS), Norway. It is evident that in addition to personal motivations to collaborate, academics are driven to engage locally by certain incentives that may be embedded in regionally ‘non-constructed’ advantages. In general, the presence of regional advantages that are relevant for advancing the academic’s research provide the motivation to engage locally.",Ahoba-Sam R.,Journal,"Regional Studies, Regional Science",2019-01-01,Lincoln International Business School,collaboration ;  local academic engagement ;  motivations ;  regional advantages ;  University of Stavanger ;  university–industry linkages

Enhanced function-means modeling supporting design space exploration,"One problem in incremental product development is that geometric models are limited in their ability to explore radical alternative design variants. In this publication, a function modeling approach is suggested to increase the amount and variety of explored alternatives, since function models (FM) provide greater model flexibility. An enhanced function-means (EF-M) model capable of representing the constraints of the design space as well as alternative designs is created through a reverse engineering process. This model is then used as a basis for the development of a new product variant. This work describes the EF-M model's capabilities for representing the design space and integrating novel solutions into the existing product structure and explains how these capabilities support the exploration of alternative design variants. First-order analyses are executed, and the EF-M model is used to capture and represent already existing design information for further analyses. Based on these findings, a design space exploration approach is developed. It positions the FM as a connection between legacy and novel designs and, through this, allows for the exploration of more diverse product concepts. This approach is based on three steps-decomposition, design, and embodiment-and builds on the capabilities of EF-M to model alternative solutions for different requirements. While the embodiment step of creating the novel product's geometry is still a topic for future research, the design space exploration concept can be used to enable wider, more methodological, and potentially automated design space exploration.",Müller J.; Isaksson O.; Landahl J.; Raja V.; Panarotto M.; Levandowski C.; Raudberget D.,Journal,"Artificial Intelligence for Engineering Design, Analysis and Manufacturing: AIEDAM",2019-01-01,GKN Aerospace;Chalmers University of Technology,Concept design ;  design space exploration ;  DSM ;  enhanced function-means modeling ;  function modeling ;  radical innovation
Building and construction research in Malaysia: A bibliometric analysis,"This paper presents a bibliometric analysis of building and construction research authored by researchers reporting an affiliation to institutions in Malaysia from years 2000 to 2015. The objectives are to identify the most productive research institutions and researchers, the research themes at these institutions, the output and impact of the research carried out and the most prolific authors. A search on the Scopus database identified 1,668 articles published during this period. The results indicate that research output was primarily from the five public research universities reflecting their privileged funding model and that output had increased rapidly in recent years. Topics of research were broad ranging from materials and structures in the engineering field, to the more conventional construction management and building science topics. Although numerous authors from Malaysia have high citation counts and h-indices, the overall impact of the research was low with many articles either published in low impact journals or received few citations. There is evidence of publication inflation where the increase in publication counts have not been matched by a comparable increase in citation counts.

Multi-modelling and Co-simulation in the Engineering of Cyber-Physical Systems: Towards the Digital Twin,"Ensuring the dependability of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) poses challenges for model-based engineering, stemming from the semantic heterogeneity of the models of computational, physical and human processes, and from the range of stakeholders involved. We argue that delivering such dependability requires a marriage of multi-disciplinary models developed during design with models derived from real operational data. Assets developed during design thus become the basis of a learning digital twin, able to support decision making both in redesign and in responsive operation. Starting from an open integrated toolchain leveraging formal models for CPS design, we consider the extension of this concept towards digital twins. A small example inspired by agricultural robotics illustrates some of the opportunities for research and innovation in delivering digital twins that contribute to dependability.",Fitzgerald J.; Larsen P.; Pierce K.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2019-01-01,Aarhus Universitet;Newcastle University,

Fast experimentations with virtual technologies pave the way for experience economy,"The ongoing revolution in people's behavior, involving emphasized personal experiences, means that a product plays a decreasing role in competition, and creating an experience is becoming more important. This leads to new kinds of value chains and new kinds of networking, which will create challenges for companies. Cognitive infocomminacations (CogInfoCom) provide fast infocommunications links to extend our cognitive capabilities. Virtual technologies, such as virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR), will increase value creation by combining the strengths of humans and machines. The aim of this paper is to present an approach through which VR/AR with game programming tools can be utilized to boost business and enable new value creation in a world that is developing towards an experience economy. Our design methodology is based on agile innovation principles with fast experimentations that are carried out in co-creation with companies. The practical implementations are considered as multiple case studies. After introducing the current trends in VR/AR, we present our experiences of how these virtual technologies can be applied for CogInfoCom Aided Engineering tasks in various application fields. Despite the increasing popularity of virtual and augmented reality and game technologies, only a small amount of research has examined how they can be utilized professionally in the design processes of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, they provide effective tools for increasing user involvement in new product development and marketing. Based on the case studies, we present our experiences of how SMEs can benefit from virtual technologies by increasing their business agility and flexibility, reducing product design risk, shortening product development time, and enabling new business models.

Application example: Assessment of the technological maturity of Brazilian innovation institutes,"The advancing globalisation and simultaneous liberalisation of the markets not only have a tremendous influence on companies in the manufacturing industry, but also lead to new challenges for the research sector. Especially Research and Technology Organisations (RTOs) as bridges of basic research and the industry favour technological change on the one hand and increase the competitiveness of the industry through innovative solutions on the other. (Arnold, Clark, Jávorka 2010; Breznik 2015). The resulting high need for technological innovation pushes RTOs to intensify competition for technology leadership in order to sustain market competiveness. In this regard, RTOs must be able to develop technological solutions that translate results from research and science into state-of-the-art products and services. This can only be achieved when technological resources and competences are effectively and efficiently used to build up competitive advantages. (Kröll 2007; Figueiredo 2014; Zehnder 1997) Therefore, the assessment of technological maturity can provide RTOs with information on strengths and weaknesses in their specific technology areas (Kelessidis 2000), on the basis of which technology strategies can be derived to contribute to the development and training of substantial (core) competences (Klappert, Schuh, Aghassi 2011), which in turn improve the quality of unique and differentiating products and services (EARTO 2005). In this context, the aim of this paper is to give an application example of a technological maturity assessment of a Brazilian institutes of innovation within the framework of a technology audit. The organization SENAI (National Service of Industrial Training), which is mainly responsible for vocational training and education with more than 1.000 units spread all over Brazil, started to create a network of 26 applied research units (the SENAI Innovation Institutes - ISIs) in 2012. After the first years of operation and ramping-up these institutes, the headquarter of SENAI and the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, under the leadership of the Fraunhofer IPK, jointly started in 2017 to evaluate the technological maturity of the SENAI Innovation Institutes. Within this paper, the methodology as well as the results of selected technology audits that were executed in different ISIs in 2019 will be described.",Hecklau F.; Kidschun F.; Will M.; Kohl H.; Prim M.; Pavim A.; Oliveira J.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE",2019-01-01,Serviço Nacional de Aprendizagem Industrial;Instituto Tecnologico de Aeronautica;Technische Universität Berlin;Fraunhofer Institute for Production Systems and Design Technology IPK,Assessment Method ;  Research and Technology Organisations ;  RTO ;  Technological Capability ;  Technological Maturity

How different are engineering design projects? An analysis of middle school lessons and units,"Engineering education has gained momentum in K-12 education in recent years. However, available curricula and teaching materials take a variety of approaches, guided by limited research identifying or comparing these approaches. Using content analysis, I analysed, classroom-tested and published engineering lessons used in middle school grades (ages 13-15). The evaluation resulted in five types of implementation: design-build-test projects, experimentation tasks that highlight engineering science principles, contextualised problem solving through integrated STEM units, innovation projects where students identify a need and pursue their own projects, and optimization tasks with a focus on improving a suboptimal system. These implementation methods differ based on their goals, what part of the design process they engage, and the activities they emphasize. The variations in teaching models suggest differences need to be well-understood by educators and curriculum designers. Future research is necessary examining differences in student learning outcomes associated with the differences in the implementation models.",Purzer S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 46th SEFI Annual Conference 2018: Creativity, Innovation and Entrepreneurship for Engineering Education Excellence",2019-01-01,Purdue University,Design ;  K-12 education
On some open-ended challenges in model-based fault management for aerospace systems: A look backwards and forwards,"Aerospace has always been a powerful engine of innovation. When we look to the future, it is not obvious to predict where the things are going but there is no doubt that the vector is pointed toward more autonomy and intelligence and that aerospace systems are becoming more distributed and more connected. Nevertheless, the maturity of technologies remains overriding and new unconventional technologies are only adopted if there is a proven need that cannot adequately addressed through conventional employed techniques. Yet, regulatory standards evolve as the industry matures and thanks to new innovative and disruptive technologies and digital transformation, a greater period of innovation is being opened to shape the future of aerospace. The talk will start with the current situation and a look backwards: about a half-century after the early academic works in model-based / data-driven fault management, there exists today a widening gap between advanced academic methods and real-world aerospace applications. The talk will attempt to highlight some of the main reasons for this situation. Next, the talk will argue that for the foreseeable future and given the predicted demands on aviation and aerospace industry, new distributed/cooperative model-based fault management methodologies will be required to enable paradigm shifts in future flight operational issues management. Solutions will arise from cross-domain research at the interface between system & control theory and computer science. Finally, the talk will discuss a future paradigm shift in civil aviation operations toward more autonomy in the cockpit, and some related challenges and opportunities.",Zolghadri A.,Conference Proceeding,"ICINCO 2019 - Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Informatics in Control, Automation and Robotics",2019-01-01,Université de Bordeaux,Aerospace Systems ;  Flight-critical Systems ;  Model-based Fault Management
The Teaching of Engineers Focused on Innovative Entrepreneurship,"Engineering schools have a traditional way of teaching based on a sequence of subjects, beginning with fundamental sciences, mathematics, technologies and finally exploring practice and technics. This kind of program allows to deepen each subject, however, hinders the perception of the connections among the parts of a problem. Some schools changed their course aiming to turn the program more attractive to the students and, at the same time, more focused on the solution of actual problems the professionals face. For that, they used an innovative entrepreneurship approach changing the teaching-learning process. This article aims to identify the factors necessary to implement an innovative entrepreneurial engineering education, as well as explain such factors through literature review. As a result, two major categories of factors are observed, the teaching-learning process and university management. The first one encompasses the role of teachers, students, curriculum, and extracurricular activities. The literature suggests an open speech among students and teachers where they can explore multiple and critical perspectives. The PBL (Project-Based Learning) is recommended as a teaching-learning process. Extracurricular activities like scientific initiation, Incubators, and patents are other factors that contribute to this type of teaching. In university management, the incentive to innovation in engineering education is strongly recommended, besides providing students and teachers with an infrastructure that supports research and development and deployment of organizational culture and structure focusing on innovative entrepreneurship.",Miquilim D.; Terra da Silva M.,Book Series,IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2019-01-01,Universidade Paulista,Entrepreneurship ;  Professional service management ;  University management engineering education
Systematic Creation of Cumulative Design Science Research Knowledge with a Case Study in the Field of Automatic Speech Recognition,"This paper proposes a method for the systematic build-up of incremental Information Systems Design Science Research knowledge using tight linkage with a process model for digital innovation. This results in the enhanced presentation of a new design science approach to the engineering of digital innovation that systematically builds up information systems design theories. We evaluate this combined new method artifact in a case study for an innovative conversational interface of an interactive voice response system that was developed in a university-industry innovation lab, trained on a gender and age specific speech database and offering automatically tailored services for each identified user group.

Crowd Engineering: Manage Crowd Contributions for Design and Manufacture of Innovative Products,"The increasing complexity of designing and manufacturing products as well as the growing speed required for their innovation is pushing large and medium-small companies to an ever-broader search for new ideas and for a wide availability of experts, able to provide timely contributions. Existing approaches mainly address the early phases of the product lifecycle in the frame of “open innovation”. The crowd engineering approach is to organize an efficient and effective utilization of the “crowd”, i.e. a wide set of persons, from students to private experts, and to start-ups and smart SMEs, which could be involved in the creation of innovative products. The first purpose of the paper is to give a presentation of Crowd Engineering in terms of a logical frame where crowd-workers will contribute into an informal collaborative network to fulfill technical and social needs. Then a schematic model based on an analogy between Crowd Engineering and Supply Relationship Management, will be outlined thus offering, on one hand, suggestions for a real implementation, on the other, some hints for a research agenda.",Villa A.; Taurino T.,Book Series,IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2019-01-01,Politecnico di Torino,Combinatorial optimization model ;  Crowd Engineering
"Engineering-Business: The Co-production of Institutions, Skills and Engineering Challenges","The long-lived and widely held political imagination surrounding innovation is that of a process by which new developments in science and technology are transformed into new business applications. As a result higher education and professions are eager to impose their expertises onto, and claim authority within, the domain of innovation. In recent decades, universities and other engineering institutions that are typically associated with technology development, or ‘technology push’, have expanded their research and teaching activities toward the business end of innovation – also known as the ‘demand’ or ‘pull’ side. The chapter investigates the new emergent trend in academic institution building where business or demand-oriented competencies are incorporated to engineering curricula. Drawing on the theoretical frameworks of co-production and sociotechnical imaginaries developed by Sheila Jasanoff and others, we analyze how social scientists at the Technical University of Denmark, in response to new demands for autonomous economy within Danish universities, invented the ‘Design and Innovation’ engineering program. Despite its controversial curricular composition, Design and Innovation entailed a revised status for engineering that brought together: creativity; social awareness; and product innovation. The successful implementation of Design & Innovation can be seen as a result of its unique capacity to bring together emphasis on application with new ‘holistic’ visions for higher education. The chapter contributes to contemporary discussions of transformations within the university system and implies that we should look more closely at the interplay between engineering, business and the surrounding society, and how engineering and business are valued, in order to understand the meaning of the engineering-business nexus.",Juhl J.; Buch A.,Book Series,Philosophy of Engineering and Technology,2019-01-01,Aalborg University,Co-production ;  Engineering education ;  Higher education ;  Innovation ;  Reform ;  Sociotechnical imaginaries
Application of the digital innovation and transformation process in zoo gardening facilities,"In many industrial domains and service sectors, digitalization efforts show first results. New kinds of products and services were introduced, which would not have been possible without end-to-end digitalization of operational processes, continuous collection and evaluation of data about product use and evaluation of customer data or activities. Facing the challenge of customer satisfaction in terms of leisure activities, zoos are in need to modernize their tours and attendances. Therefore, this paper describes the application of the Digital Innovation and Transformation Process (DITP) in animal-gardening facilities, as it collects, analyzes and structures information of 19 facilities within the “Landeszooverband Mecklenburg-Vorpommern e.V.” and combines them with qualitative studies. The research aims to analyze and focus the companies’ intention for the digitization of zoos by using the first phase of the DITP.

Applying big data technologies to high tech manufacturing,"The systematic analysis of ever-increasing data collection presents companies with ever-greater challenges. Many manufacturing organizations simply lack the know-how to handle Big Data projects and the corresponding data analysis right. Therefore one simply follows the current trends and buzz words and adopts approaches which are currently en vogue. This approach often leads to less successful projects and several regularly reoccurring patterns of misconceptions can be identified. This paper highlights some of these unsuccessful patterns and introduces some of the work done in the PRO-OPT SMART-DATA research project. The innovation in this data analysis approach is the combination of traditional statistical methods with new Big Data and AI analysis techniques applied to high tech manufacturing. Being able to align process data with the complete metrology data provides amazing new insights into the manufacturing. Furthermore, we will introduce a new visualization technique specifically suited for domains with high amounts of categorical data like semiconductor, photovoltaics, electronics and such. This paper will show how the combination of the statistical data analysis system Cornerstone in conjunction with Apache Spark1 and Apache Cassandra2 provides a good basis for engineering analytics of massive data amounts. By properly nesting the solid mathematical methods in Cornerstone with big data-appropriate infrastructure such as Apache Spark and, in our case, Apache Cassandra, many new analytics issues can be addressed. Analyzes that used to be inefficient due to the sheer volume of data in classically modeled schema's can now be performed through appropriate big-table modeling and provide the ability to provide completely new insights into production data. Those directly impacted the manufacturing procedures and improved the products quality and reliability. Experiences gained in the project impacted the upcoming VDI/VDE guideline 37143 to be published later in the year 2019.",Ortloff D.; Knoblauch N.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,2019-01-01,,Analytics ;  Artificial Intelligence ;  Automotiv ;  Big Data ;  Manufacturing ;  MultiCategory Chart ;  Random Forest
Ethics In Innovation Management As Meta-responsibility: The practice of responsible research and innovation in human brain simulation,"The concept and practice of responsible research and innovation (RRI) are subjects of intense academic scrutiny (Timmermans, 2015). This high level of attention is at least partly due to the support of RRI by research funders such as the European Union, the UK Engineering and Science Research Council (EPSRC), the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) and others. Much research is being undertaken to clarify conceptual underpinnings and to describe current and future practice. Despite these activities, it is currently not clear how theoretical accounts of RRI can be put into practice to achieve RRI’s promise to contribute to the social acceptability and desirability of R&I activities.",Stahl B.; Timmermans J.; Rainey S.; Shaw M.,Book,The Routledge Companion to Innovation Management,2019-01-01,"Faculteit Techniek, Bestuur en Management, TU Delft;De Montfort University",
"International faculty, knowledge transfer, and innovation in higher education: A human resource development perspective","In the field of international human resource management, a widely held assumption identifies expatriation as a completely enriching experience which provides employees with knowledge of high value and contributes to enhancing general management capacity [24]. This research investigates the effect of expatriation on knowledge transfer as a driver for innovation and performance. The study uses the case of international faculty in a higher education institution to shed light on the interplay between sharing international experiences, facilitating knowledge transfer, and generating value. Following a thorough literature review, research on knowledge transfer processes within the education sector remains limited. We still have little guidance on the mechanisms enabling knowledge transfer inside universities, particularly when promoting faculty mobility or hiring international faculty and researchers. This research adopts a single case study method while using Al Akhawayn University in Ifrane, an international higher education institution, as a context of investigation. The study involved international faculty from the schools of engineering, business, and humanities and also Moroccan faculty who received their education abroad to explore the processes of experience and knowledge sharing among diverse workforce and how such processes could lead to creating a space for knowledge transfer that enables in turn better innovation and performance. The findings of this research show the limited knowledge transfer dynamics inside internationally-oriented higher education institutions and demonstrate the importance of adopting human resource development practices as facilitating mechanisms to support knowledge transfer while involving and benefitting various stakeholders. The study suggests different developmental venues for universities to support knowledge transfer from international faculty including teamwork, training and faculty orientation, collaborative research projects, resources and incentives, and industry-oriented educational and consulting programs. This research has the potential to lay the foundations of a theoretical framework integrating knowledge transfer and value generation dynamics within the context of higher education.",Djikhy S.; Moustaghfir K.,Journal,Human Systems Management,2019-01-01,Al Akhawayn University,Expatriation ;  innovation ;  international faculty ;  knowledge transfer ;  performance ;  workforce diversity
The development of the Canadian research and development classification,"I describe the development of a new research and development taxonomy to facilitate the reporting of granting agency investments in research and the organization of effective peer review processes in Canada, which represents a kind of classification designed to support the administrative management of research. The development of the Canadian Research and Development Classification (CRDQ is being led by the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI), the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERQ and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRQ, in close collaboration with Statistics Canada. This collaboration represents an unprecedented effort by the federal research funding agencies and Statistics Canada to develop a common standard for the classification of research and development activities in Canada, and is intended to meet different needs within the broader research ecosystem. The CRDC, intended to align the way research and development is categorized in Canada, is the result of months of reviews, consultations, analysis and negotiations among the agencies and the Canadian research community. Notably, the CRDC was designed to include all sectors of research and development, represent the current research landscape in Canada, support a wide range of needs within the research and development ecosystem, and increase computability with international standards.",Legendre A.,Journal,Knowledge Organization,2019-01-01,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council,Canadian ;  Classification ;  Fields of research and development ;  Research classification
Microbial metabolomics: Innovations and applications,"Over the past few years, metabolomics has been employed in a broad range of applications in different research fields. Microbial metabolomics has been applied in several microbiological areas, such as identification of microorganisms, cell mutations, functional gene approach, identification of unique metabolic pathways and microbial engineering, leading to a better understanding of the global metabolism and metabolic regulation of certain systems. Metabolites produced by microorganisms constitute a large promising group with diverse applications; however, most of these systems are still unknown and underexplored. In this context, the overall analysis of metabolites involved in a biological system can be used to discover potential biomarkers or specific metabolic changes due to a biological phenomenon studied. In this sense, this review aims to understand the main challenges faced by each step of the workflow in the metabolic analysis of microorganisms and how these difficulties have been overcome. A critical analysis of the articles published within the last five years will be accomplished in this paper to understand how these studies have contributed to the microbial metabolomics research. Moreover, major trends observed in this area will be highlighted here in order to guide readers interested in microbial metabolomics in their future researches.",Belinato J.; Bazioli J.; Sussulini A.; Augusto F.; Filla T.,Journal,Quimica Nova,2019-01-01,Universidade Estadual de Campinas;Instituto Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia de Bioanalítica,Metabolomics ;  Metabolomics analysis ;  Metabolomics workflow ;  Microorganism ;  Sample preparation
Innovative digital manufacturing curriculum for industry 4.0,"Manufacturing companies across all major industries are facing serious challenges trying to competitively design and manage modern products, which are becoming increasingly complex multi-domain systems or ""systems of systems"". Model-based systems driven product development (or SDPD, for Systems Driven Product Development) has been proposed as a solution based on driving the product lifecycle from the systems requirements and tracing back performance to stakeholders' needs through a RFLP (Requirement, Functional, Logical, Physical) traceability process. The SDPD framework integrates system behavioral modeling with downstream product design and manufacturing process practices to support the verification/validation of the systems behavior as products progress through all phases of the lifecycle, as well as the optimization of trade-offs decisions by maintaining the cross-product digital twin and thread for global decision optimization in an efficient and effective way. We have developed an innovative digital manufacturing curriculum (designed around the SDPD paradigm) that is based on the digitalization of the SE (Systems Engineering) process through the integration of modelling and simulation continuum, in the form of Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE), with Product lifecycle management (PLM). At the core of this curriculum is a shift of focus from theory to implementation and practice, through an applied synthesis of engineering fundamentals and systems engineering, that is driven by a state-of-the-art digital innovation platform for product (or system) development consisting of integrated software (digital) tools spanning the complete lifecycle. The curriculum consists of three key components, namely, modelling and simulation continuum, traceability, and digital thread. The curriculum provides a foundation for implementing the digital twin and supports the training of the next generation of engineers for Industry 4.0. The digital manufacturing (or SDPD) framework is applied in the design and optimization of an electric skateboard. The implementation demonstrates: 1) The benefits of digitalization/model-based engineering when developing complex multi-domain products or systems; 2) The ability of students to effectively complete a real-life modern product development within the time line of one semester; 3) The provision of MBSE curriculum for Engineering Education 4.0, characterized by key, integrated skills for the digital enterprise and Industry 4.0.",Promyoo R.; Alai S.; El-Mounayri H.,Conference Proceeding,,2019-01-01,Purdue School of Engineering and Technology;Initiative for Product Lifecycle Innovation,Digital manufacturing ;  Digital thread ;  Industry 4.0 ;  SDPD
Proposal of a thematic and technological tree on agroindustrial engineering as a tool for a prospective study,"This article presents a thematic and technological tree proposal for Agroindustrial Engineering programs as an input for the development of prospective studies that strengthen their strategic direction. A literature review through the use of Scopus was carried out on 84 articles related to the keywords Agroindustrial Engineering, in aspects such as country of origin, authors and thematic and technological contents. Among the most important results is the identification of 294 topics and technologies related to four thematic axes: Information and communications technology, sustainability, agro-industrial byproducts and biotechnology. It was observed that between the four axes new topics and technologies appear that should be taken into account for the restructuring of the curriculum of the faculties of Agroindustrial Engineering.

The objective of this research is to promote collaborative learning by integrating the BYOS method to the Flipped Classroom model in the teaching of Scrum concepts. The results obtained are encouraging because the applied method facilitated the understanding of the contents and the perception of the students was positive regarding collaborative learning. The results also indicate that the time should be well controlled to achieve the objectives in this kind of pedagogical innovations in the classroom.,Cornide-Reyes H.; Villarroel R.,Journal,Formacion Universitaria,2019-01-01,Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso;Universidad de Atacama,Active learning ;  Collaborative learning ;  Flipped classroom ;  Software engineering
Prediction of ship resistance with the use of full-scale CFD simulations marine 2019,"In recent years, the IMO has introduced new regulations to reduce the negative impact of ships on the natural environment. A particularly important step forcing technological innovations is the increasing requirement of ship energy efficiency. It is expressed by the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI). Another important step towards green shipping is raising the required quality of fuel used for propulsion, the so-called Tier limits. Higher demand of Low Sulfur Fuel Oil resulted in its price rising up by 200% in the past two years. All these aspects increase the importance of ship fuel economy. As a result, the hull resistance reduction plays a significant role in the design process of new vessels. For vessels operating at sites with moderate and rough waves, the shape of the hull and, in particular, the bow section plays an important role. The paper presents results of some of the research carried out as a part of the ""Smart Propulsion System"" research project. The presented stage of the work includes a full-scale CFD simulation for a case study ship redesigned from an as-built V-shaped bulbous bow to three different innovative variants. Changes in the hull form were made in such a way that the redesigned hull versions preserved the main dimensions and hydrostatic parameters of the original design. The paper presents ship resistance analysis on calm water as a part of seakeeping analysis. The scope of the work was full-scale CFD simulations of four innovative hull forms in order to determine total resistance, dynamic trim and sinkage. The influence of bow and stern shape, wetted surface area and waterplane area on total resistance was investigated. Main conclusions were formulated for the novel hull forms being analysed. The scope of further work was formulated, and it included assessment of the combined influence of the ship’s speed and waving conditions on the performance at a specific operational site. To reduce fuel consumption, the optimal design and operation of the ship are equally important and can be supported by full-scale CFD simulations.",Niklas K.; Pruszko H.,Conference Proceeding,"8th International Conference on Computational Methods in Marine Engineering, MARINE 2019",2019-01-01,Gdańsk University of Technology,CFD ;  Computational methods ;  Marine engineering ;  Ship resistance
Antecedents of student retention: The influence of innovation and quality of teaching in Brazilian universities,"Innovation in teaching is related to a form of service delivery in which teaching methods contribute to students learning process. Higher education institutions are looking for ways to engage and retain students. In this sense, this study aims to analyse the relationships between innovation in teaching, quality in teaching, organisational commitment and student retention. In order to achieve this goal, a quantitative, descriptive research was carried out with analysis through modelling of structural equations, applied to eight higher education institutions (public and private), in the courses of administration, accounting sciences and production engineering, with participation of 703 students in the southern states of Brazil. Results show that innovation must generate quality, in order to compromise students.

"Individual based model links thermodynamics, chemical speciation and environmental conditions to microbial growth","Individual based Models (IbM) must transition from research tools to engineering tools. To make the transition we must aspire to develop large, three dimensional and physically and biologically credible models. Biological credibility can be promoted by grounding, as far as possible, the biology in thermodynamics. Thermodynamic principles are known to have predictive power in microbial ecology. However, this in turn requires a model that incorporates pH and chemical speciation. Physical credibility implies plausible mechanics and a connection with the wider environment. Here, we propose a step toward that ideal by presenting an individual based model connecting thermodynamics, pH and chemical speciation and environmental conditions to microbial growth for 5·105 individuals. We have showcased the model in two scenarios: a two functional group nitrification model and a three functional group anaerobic community. In the former, pH and connection to the environment had an important effect on the outcomes simulated. Whilst in the latter pH was less important but the spatial arrangements and community productivity (that is, methane production) were highly dependent on thermodynamic and reactor coupling. We conclude that if IbM are to attain their potential as tools to evaluate the emergent properties of engineered biological systems it will be necessary to combine the chemical, physical, mechanical and biological along the lines we have proposed. We have still fallen short of our ideals because we cannot (yet) calculate specific uptake rates and must develop the capacity for longer runs in larger models. However, we believe such advances are attainable. Ideally in a common, fast and modular platform. For future innovations in IbM will only be of use if they can be coupled with all the previous advances.",Gogulancea V.; González-Cabaleiro R.; Li B.; Taniguchi D.; Jayathilake P.; Chen J.; Wilkinson D.; Swailes D.; McGough A.; Zuliani P.; Ofiteru I.; Curtis T.,Journal,Frontiers in Microbiology,2019-01-01,Newcastle University;University Politehnica of Bucharest;University of Oxford Medical Sciences Division;University of Glasgow,Chemical speciation ;  Individual based model ;  Methanogenesis ;  Nitrification ;  Thermodynamics

However, many primary and secondary teachers are inadequately prepared for teaching STEM because of their limited exposure in their own schooling and teacher preparation. The Remote Access Laboratories for Fun, Innovation and Education (RALfie) project offer opportunities to provide a variety of STEM experiences available to students and teachers in schools, especially those in remote locations. They also have potential for influencing teachers' self-efficacy to teach STEM by building up their capacities and capabilities to teach technologies.

Grouping of carbonaceous nanomaterials based on association of patterns of inflammatory markers in BAL fluid with adverse outcomes in lungs,"Carbonaceous nanomaterials (CNMs) are universally being used to make commodities, as they present unique opportunities for development and innovation in the fields of engineering, biotechnology, etc. As technology advances to incorporate CNMs in industry, the potential exposures associated with these particles also increase. CNMs have been found to be associated with substantial pulmonary toxicity, including inflammation, fibrosis, and/or granuloma formation in animal models. This study attempts to categorize the toxicity profiles of various carbon allotropes, in particular, carbon black, different multi-walled carbon nanotubes, graphene-based materials, and their derivatives. Statistical and machine learning-based approaches were used to identify groups of CNMs with similar pulmonary toxicity responses from a panel of proteins measured in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid samples and with similar pathological outcomes in the lungs. Thus, grouped particles, based on their pulmonary toxicity profiles, were used to select a small set of proteins that could potentially identify and discriminate between the toxicity profiles associated within each group. Specifically, MDC/CCL22 and MIP-3β/CCL19 were identified as common protein markers associated with both toxicologically distinct groups of CNMs. In addition, the persistent expression of other selected protein markers in BAL fluid from each group suggested their ability to predict toxicity in the lungs, i.e. fibrosis and microgranuloma formation. The advantages of such approaches can have positive implications for further research in toxicity profiling.",Yanamala N.; Desai I.; Miller W.; Kodali V.; Syamlal G.; Roberts J.; Erdely A.,Journal,Nanotoxicology,2019-01-01,School of Computer Science;The Ohio State University;National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health,inflammatory profile ;  nanomaterial grouping ;  Pulmonary toxicity ;  risk assessment

The secondary pollution risk of environmental dredging project and technical measures,"Environmental Dredging is a technique of heterotopic restoration of polluted sediment through engineering measures. It is an economical, highly effective and complete measure to treat polluted sediment, which can effectively reduce the release of pollutants from sediment into water systems and create conditions for the recovery of water ecosystem. However, during the process of environmental dredging operations, the polluted sediment particles are prone to suspending and diffusing. Besides, inevitable leakage accident in the transportation process, improper disposal and smell of sediment, the difficulty to reach discharge standard for residual water, all of the problems above are possible to cause secondary pollutions to our environment. Accordingly, the optimization of dredging equipment, the research on resources utilization of dredged sediment containing pollutants have been widely carried out at home and abroad, which can effectively reduce the secondary pollution risk of the environmental dredging project to the ecological environment, providing innovations for management in ecological environment.",Xiaolong Y.; Shaolin Y.; Xiaopeng J.; Yang L.; Wei C.; Peihong C.,Conference Proceeding,"22nd World Dredging Congress, WODCON 2019",2019-01-01,,Environmental Dredging ;  Secondary pollution ;  Sediment ;  Suspended substance
Study on the measurement of green technology innovation efficiency of industrial enterprises based on DEA model: An example from Hubei province,"Based on the two-stage innovation value chain theory, this paper takesk Hubei province as an example and usesthe panel data of 11 cities (states) in the province from 2009 to 2016 to calculate the efficiency of the two stages of green technology innovation of industrial enterprises in each city (states) by DEA method. The results show that the average comprehensive efficiency of green technology innovation of industrial enterprises in Hubei province is only 0.664, and there is still much room for improvement. The green technology innovation efficiency is lower than the traditional technology innovation efficiency; low scale efficiency is the main reason for the low efficiency of green technology innovation of industrial enterprises in Hubei province. The evaluation index system of green technology innovation efficiency of industrial enterprises should be established by taking environment factors into account. According to the origin of low efficiency of green technology innovation of industrial enterprises in each city (state), we should take targeted measures for improvement and strengthen the leading role of enterprises in technological innovation.",Sun L.; Li D.; Wu Q.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Logistics and Systems Engineering 2018,2019-01-01,Wuhan Donghu University,DEA model ;  Green technology development ;  Green technology innovation efficiency ;  Transformation of green technology achievements
"Technology-mediated resources as a substitute to human resources: Experiences of international undergraduate students in an active, blended, and collaborative (abc) classroom in the USA","With the call for increasing student diversity in engineering courses, it is important to conduct research on evidence-based teaching practices that could address the unique challenges encountered by international students in the USA. In this study, we examine the experiences of international undergraduate students taking a core mechanical engineering course in an Active, Blended, and Collaborative (ABC) environment. We adopt a qualitative research approach based upon thematic analysis to explore the students' experiences in this complex pedagogical framework and analyze how they use the different facets of the ABC learning resources to address the various challenges that they encounter in the course. Our results show that international students preferred to use the immediately accessible non-human resources made available to them in the course. Furthermore, international students were reluctant to interact with the instructor both inside and outside of the class. The technology-mediated resources provided on the course website helped the students to clarify any misunderstandings that they developed due to the language barrier in the classroom. In general, undergraduate STEM instructors could utilize pedagogical innovations such as ABC learning to help international students cope with some of the challenges that they face while navigating through their undergraduate STEM experience in the USA.",Kandakatla R.; Berger E.; Rhoads J.; Deboer J.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 8th Research in Engineering Education Symposium, REES 2019 - Making Connections",2019-01-01,KG Reddy College of Engineering & Technology;Purdue University,

Application of construction solutions of biped walking robots in designing a prosthetic foot,"The recreation of the human gait pattern has been a challenge for biped robot constructors for years. A foot and ankle are important structural components of a biped robot, while in the case of amputation their proper design is a decisive factor in the recreation of the correct gait stereotype in a person with a prosthesis. The paper presents design solutions of selected biped robots’ foot models. The chosen foot models’ mechanic operation is similar to the biomechanics of the human foot. The work is the review of prosthetic feet dynamics as well. The design of a prosthetic foot begins with the analysis of the biomechanics of a healthy human gait. The gait tests of a healthy person lead to determining correct gait determinants. Determining the angles of flexion of the ankle during walking also shows imperfections of current prostheses and the possibility of eliminating errors in subsequent designs. In addition, research allows to determine the correct trajectory of movement of key points of the body and the value of their accelerations while walking. Gait analysis was performed using the BTS Smart system. When designing a prosthetic foot, it is important to ensure the stability of the gait by positioning a prosthetic foot’s centre of gravity and elasticity as well as taking into account an appropriate ankle drive, including dorsiflexion of the foot, which is often overlooked in design concepts and whose lack can influence the patient’s greater susceptibility to falls. A common feature for prosthetic and robotic feet is to ensure optimal static and dynamic balance. The main innovation that is possible to implement when designing prosthetic feet is the use of construction solutions of drives used in walking robots.",Gramala A.; Drapikowski P.; Pogorzała A.; Walczak T.,Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2019-01-01,Politechnika Poznanska;Hipolit Cegielski State College of Higher Education in Gniezno,Biped robots ;  Design ;  Gait ;  Prosthetic foot

Deep learning intervention for health care challenges: Some biomedical domain considerations,"The use of deep learning (DL) for the analysis and diagnosis of biomedical and health care problems has received unprecedented attention in the last decade. The technique has recorded a number of achievements for unearthing meaningful features and accomplishing tasks that were hitherto difficult to solve by other methods and human experts. Currently, biological and medical devices, treatment, and applications are capable of generating large volumes of data in the form of images, sounds, text, graphs, and signals creating the concept of big data. The innovation of DL is a developing trend in the wake of big data for data representation and analysis. DL is a type of machine learning algorithm that has deeper (or more) hidden layers of similar function cascaded into the network and has the capability to make meaning from medical big data. Current transformation drivers to achieve personalized health care delivery will be possible with the use of mobile health (mHealth). DL can provide the analysis for the deluge of data generated from mHealth apps. This paper reviews the fundamentals of DL methods and presents a general view of the trends in DL by capturing literature from PubMed and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers database publications that implement different variants of DL. We highlight the implementation of DL in health care, which we categorize into biological system, electronic health record, medical image, and physiological signals. In addition, we discuss some inherent challenges of DL affecting biomedical and health domain, as well as prospective research directions that focus on improving health management by promoting the application of physiological signals and modern internet technology.",Tobore I.; Li J.; Yuhang L.; Al-Handarish Y.; Kandwal A.; Nie Z.; Wang L.,Journal,JMIR mHealth and uHealth,2019-01-01,University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;Chinese Academy of Sciences,Artificial intelligence ;  Big data ;  Biologicals ;  Biomedical ;  Deep learning ;  ECG ;  EEG ;  Electronic health record ;  Machine learning ;  Medical imaging ;  MHealth

Technology foresights for coal industry in russia up to 2040. Part I: Forecasts of coal production and prices by price scenarios on the world oil market up to 2040 information about authors,"This part of the article reviews stages of Industry-4.0 project implementation in the coal industry. There are three key stages effectible in the coal industry in the long-range: Digital automation of coal mining, washing and handling; Big Data-based management and pattern recognition (Internet of Things intelligent network arrangement); creation and introduction of artificial brain and robots (industrial cyber-physical system engineering). The main technologies involved in Industry-4.0 are discussed, and their effect on performance of the coal industry is assessed. The rate of introduction of the discussed stages is directly governed by the world energy market conjuncture set, in particular, by scenarios of advancement of the coal industry. For this reason, the authors forecast this advancement by two scenarios (innovation and conservative), depending on predicted oil prices up to 2040. The innovation scenario provides implementation of all three stages of technological development by 2040. The conservative scenario mostly assumes inertia development in the coal industry, with partial implementation of stages 1 and 2 by 2040, and with transition to large-scale engineering of cyber-physical systems in the distant future. For each scenario, coal production is forecasted per basins and deposits in Russia up to 2040. The predicted coal outputs are obtained using the simulation model named Production of Coal designed at the Energy Research Institute, RAS. The model takes into account planned performance of coal mines and holdings in terms of commissioning of new capacities, launching of new production, technical upgrading, closure and sale of structural subdivisions. For the forecasts of coal production dynamics, predicted price levels for coal are set per basins, deposits and grades of coal in Russia using the model Marketcoal developed at the Energy Research Institute, RAS. The model includes regional volumes of coal mining in 2000-2040, current prices of coal (on-site) and fluctuations of global oil market price. This study was partly supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research in the framework of project No. 18-010-00467: Economic Indicators and Technology Parameters for Coal Industry ion Russia up to 2035 upon the Change in the Vector for Global Technological Innovation due to Industry-4.0 Program Implementation.",Plakitkin Y.; Plakitkina L.; Diyachenko K.,Journal,Gornyi Zhurnal,2019-01-01,The Energy Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences,Coal basins ;  Coal deposits ;  Coal price forecasts ;  Coal production forecasts ;  Coal requirement ;  Free market price ;  Russia

Micro product and process fingerprints for zero-defect net-shape micromanufacturing,"Highly miniaturized systems find applications in key technological fields such as health-care, mobility, communications and optics. Required innovations for precision manufacturing of micro components can be achieved through post-process and in-process measurement of process input and output parameters. Hence, it is of critical importance to reduce the measurement and optimization effort, since process and product quality control can take a significant part of the production time in micro manufacturing. To solve this challenge, research is undertaken in order to define, investigate, implement and validate the “Product/Process Micro Manufacturing Fingerprint” concept.

The role of computer science education for understanding and shaping the digital society,"In the omnipresent discussion on the role of ICT in education, the contribution of computer science education is often mentioned, but not always understood. This paper discusses the relation between ICT education and computer science education and the benefits of understanding the fundamental concepts and ideas of Computer Science (CS). Computer science is a dynamic and highly innovative science, whose products make a significant contribution to the development of the so-called “Digital Society.” How should computer science teaching be adapted to the continuous technical further developments? Based on the outcomes of several research projects, this paper will outline how innovations in computer science can be taken up in order to improve the teaching of computer science. i.e., the topic of “databases” will in future offer a broader perspective on how to deal with data in the sense of “data management”. Agile methods, which are known from professional software development, can support learners and teachers, despite difficult school conditions, to better achieve the objectives in project based teaching. Programmable microcontrollers extend the view of computers as standing on a desktop towards ubiquitous embedded or also cyber-physical systems, which enable new and motivating approaches for the design of computer science lessons in the context of physical computing. As a target perspective, pupils should be able to understand the phenomena of the “digital society”, but also to be involved in the design of them in accordance to their needs.",Romeike R.,Book Series,IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2019-01-01,Freie Universität Berlin,Computer science education ;  Digitalization

The mechanism and empirical study of intelligent logistics technology improving the efficiency of logistics industry — Taking the “Core Area” of the silk road economic belt as example,"Using the Grey-correlation model to measure the integration degree between the intelligent technology and the logistics industry, we find the developmental level of intelligent logistics technology in the “core area” of the Silk Road Economic Belt (the spatial range of the five Central Asian countries and the five provinces in northwest China) during 2007-2016 showed a “U” shape and it is higher in the five provinces in northwest China than the five Central Asian countries. Secondly, applying SFA to calculate the logistics efficiency in the“core area”, we conclude that the overall annual average of logistics efficiency is between 0.47 and 0.72 and shows an ascending tendency from 2007 to 2016, which in accords with the World Bank LPI ranking to a large extent. Thirdly, following the three-stage maximum likelihood regression to calculate the influence of logistics information technology on logistics efficiency, we shows that the effect is positively significant at level 10%. According to the above research findings, this paper offers some corresponding suggestions, such as encouraging intelligent technological innovation and application, accelerating the construction of intelligent logistics parks, improving the level of opening and enhancing the learning effect.",Wang Q.; Luo R.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2019-01-01,Shaanxi Normal University,Core area of silk road economic belt ;  Intelligent logistics technology ;  Logistics efficiency ;  Stochastic frontier analysis
Sustainability in higher education: the impact of transformational leadership on followers’ innovative outcomes A framework proposal,"Higher Education Institutes (HEI) initiate, accelerate and facilitate regional and national development through human capital development, knowledge creation, innovation capacity building and technology transfer. As contemporary global challenges are of a mixed and multi-dimensional nature, interdisciplinary education and innovative research are needed more than ever. Thus, leaders of HEI are required to transform their institutions to respond to these challenges and the pressures created by global dynamics. This study is dedicated to designing a framework to enhance the relationship between the leadership styles and their followers’ innovative outputs. The suggested framework is based on the model of Kong et al. for leadership implicit follower theory (LIFT) and suggests the transformational leadership (TL) style to initiate the positive LIFT. This methodology proposes a set of indicators to assess innovation outputs quantitatively and intends to use engineering schools of HEIs as a sample to test the framework. It is suggested that this framework can be adjusted to examine different HEIs, colleges and R&D institutes in different contexts and at multiple leadership levels. The main outcome of this study is a framework that can be used to evaluate, assess and train existing or prospective HEI leaders, develop tailored human resources strategies, and design leadership training for students, researchers and young faculty members for their future career development in creative ventures.",Al-Mansoori R.; Koç M.,Book Series,World Sustainability Series,2019-01-01,Hamad Bin Khalifa University,Higher education ;  Innovation ;  Leadership ;  Sustainability ;  Transformational

Improvement of automation process of forest resources renewal using innovative landing material,"The Russian Federation has vast reserves of forest resources. Our country is the world's leader in terms of wood reserves (more than 80 billion cubic meters), and it exceeds the USA 2 times, China - 6 times, Sweden - 25 times, Finland - 35 times. Production capacities of the timber industry complex are quite comparable with the oil industry. A serious state policy is needed to create research centers around which the work on the introduction of innovations into production would be concentrated. Budget funds allocated for solving scientific and technical problems of the industry are scattered among scientific organizations to solve minor, private issues, which does not allow solving problems of strategic nature for innovative development of the timber industry complex. On the one hand it ultimately leads to ineffective use of budgetary funds, and on the other, it leads to stagnation of scientific organizations and loss of their scientific potential. The development of the industry will contribute to the use of biotechnology. Russian biotechnological methods are still at the stage of scientific research and are just beginning to be implemented in practice. They are used, for example, when carrying out selection work.

Inclusive innovation: Product innovation in technology supply chains,"Problem definition: Managers introducing new innovative technological products frequently face the dual task of managing both revenues and profits. This task is made challenging in part because of the tendency of new technologies to traverse a sequentially downward path of gradually lowering costs and prices, which limits their initial availability and affordability, crimping market coverage and revenues. Academic/practical relevance: We focus on the product management challenge of juggling revenues and profits, show how it is amplified in a supply chain, and propose a new degree of freedom in a supply chain, namely innovation investment anchoring, that offers product managers and their firms the ability to expand market coverage and improve both revenues and profits. Methodology: We adopt a sequential game theory approach to analyze the investment anchor decision for various objectives from investments in innovation to market coverage to profit. Results: We find that the investment anchoring approach can lead to greater investments in innovation, revenues, and profits. We also compare the investment anchoring for two types of innovation, product quality improvement and cost reduction, and show that the investment anchoring is more effective for product quality improvement. Managerial implications: Our findings have subtle but important implications for firms launching innovative products and aspiring to expand product sales and profits. Specifically, innovating firms in a supply chain by broadening the quest for an investment anchor and offering them incentives to invest as well as fine tuning the level of innovation investment with the market context can make innovation more inclusive, alleviate supply chain distortions, and streamline revenues and profits.",Krishnan V.; Lee J.; Mnyshenko O.; Shin H.,Journal,Manufacturing and Service Operations Management,2019-01-01,"A.

Factors for effective implementation of lean manufacturing practice in selected industries in Tanzania,"Nowadays, in globalization industries are adopting new techniques and tools to produce goods for sustainability. However, manufacturing industries are facing challenges to minimize operations costs, market inconsistency, competition, and everlasting demands. Lean practice helps sustainability of the industries by doing more with less resources through eliminationof non-value-added activities to maintain effectiveness and profitability. A study uses the method of survey to identify factors for effective implementation of the lean manufacturing. Two industries producing plastics, metals, textiles, woods, biscuits, and bread products were selected for the study. The results revealed that manufacturing planning and control, new product development, process and equipment, concurrent engineering, workforce management, customer relationship, and supplier relationship are positive factors for the adoption of lean practice in Tanzania. Moreover, a lean model indicates that concurrent engineering has the highest correlation to lean practice whereas new product development has the lowest significance. Thenew product development is not common because most industries have a lack of innovation, limited technology, less desire of customers on changes of product features, dearth of research and development culture, lack of desire from top management, inadequate resources, and a fear of failure for new products. It was advised that effective application of lean factors enable companies to map risk of non-value-added activities and improvebusiness value.",Kafuku J.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Manufacturing,2019-01-01,University of Dar es Salaam,Lean Factors ;  Lean Manufacturing System ;  Lean Practice Model ;  Manufacturing Industries ;  Tanzania Industrial Sustainability
The impact of servitization and digital transformation - a conceptual extension of the ipoo-framework,"Continuous innovation paves the way for companies to achieve long-term competitive advantages. Measuring the performance of innovation activities enables organizations to monitor and manage their innovation projects and competitiveness. The Input-Process-Output-Outcome (IPOO)-Framework provides a tool for performance measurement. For some years now, reinforced by the digital transformation, the trend in mechanical and plant engineering is turning away from pure product offerings towards providing Product-Service Systems (PSS). PSS consist of material benefits as well as various intangible, supplementary service components. Within the course of this servitization – from producers towards holistic solution providers – and the digital transformation, new impacts arise on the performance measurement of innovation activities, which are determined both based on literature and empirically to provide a starting point for further research. The aim of this study is to extend the IPOO-Framework adopting the identified factors to enable the performance measurement of PSS innovation activities.",Humbeck P.; Pfähler K.; Wiedenmann M.; Herzwurm G.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2019-01-01,Universität Stuttgart,Digital transformation ;  Innovation activities ;  IPOO-Framework ;  Performance measurement ;  Product service systems ;  Servitization

"""I know i have to work twice as hard and hope that makes me good enough"": Exploring the stress and strain of black doctoral students in engineering and computing","Background/Context: It is well documented that Black doctoral students in engineering and computing fields experience more stress and strain during doctoral training than their White and Asian peers. However, few studies have examined how Black engineering and computing doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers experience these challenges and stressors or focused on the psychological effects, behavioral responses, or health costs for these students. We interviewed 48 Black PhD students and postdoctoral researchers in engineering and computing departments to find out how they describe, make sense of, and cope with stressors and strains in their training programs. Study participants (29 men and 19 women) ranged from first-year doctoral students to recent PhDs. Students attended various institutions and institution types, primarily in eastern and central time zones. Nine participants attended historically Black colleges and universities, and though we anticipated that their experiences would be vastly different, their experiences closely resembled those of students in other institutions. Research Design: Each person participated in either an individual interview or focus group. Data were collected via video- and audio-recording. All focus groups took place at either a national engineering-/computing-related conference or at the students' home institutions. Twentythree participants were interviewed, while the remainder participated in focus groups of three to five students (maximum of ten). Interviews and focus groups were semistructured, using openended questions but allowing some flexibility to develop new ideas and order topics differently. Data Collection and Analysis: This study employed transcendental phenomenology, using three steps to investigate and make meaning of participants' experiences: examining the phenomenon with intentionality, eidetic reduction, and constitution of meaning. Transcendental reduction allowed for examining the experience of Black doctoral students in engineering and computing in general and separating what the research perspectives supplied from what our intuitions offered, guided by our theoretical frameworks of role strain and racial battle fatigue. Transcendental phenomenology also gave the authors a context to examine and disclose our own experiences and feelings. Findings: Consistent with prior research on role strain and John Henryism (i.e., trying to overcome a chronic stressor by working harder), we found that seeking success in training, employment, work, or career was more important to these Black graduate students and postdocs than safeguarding their mental or physical health. Meeting the demands of a PhD program or postdoctoral fellowship were critical priorities congruent with their phase of life. Their focus and sacrifice may have helped them complete their degrees, but our findings suggest that these strategies exacted psychological, emotional, and physical costs. The study deepened our understanding of significant interrelated dynamics for this population in four key ways. We found that (a) the stresses and strains made students question their qualifications; (b) racialized experiences were often the source of stress, strain, and academic performance anxiety; (c) discordance between the racial make-up of their academic environments and their racialized engineering and computing identities appeared to exacerbate impostor phenomenon; and (d) the students' proactive coping mechanisms took an emotional toll. Participants discussed the nature and sources of their feelings of self-doubt. The implications extend beyond the dwindling numbers of Black students earning STEM doctorates; this racial climate also affects the academic workforce and the professional landscape. Although Black researchers who leave academia after completing doctoral training can influence scientific innovation through other positions, it is alarming and problematic that potentially qualified future professors are dissuaded from pursuing academic careers because of their training experiences. Their absence from faculty can hinder critical innovation, breakthroughs, and the training of succeeding generations of scholars who might have learned from and collaborated with them. Conclusions and Recommendations: The added stress, strain, and toll on Black students' well-being is an underappreciated reason for their relinquishing of academic careers. Our findings illustrate the students' resilience and strength. Continued research on added stressors (e.g., impostor syndrome, racialized stress) and strengths could add much-needed consideration of cultural, structural, and interpersonal racism and the ways that Black students earning doctoral degrees in STEM fields manage to succeed despite cultural and institutional barriers. Future research should explore how to modify the microculture of STEM programs and departments to allow Black students to feel that these are healthy, safe, and fair spaces in which they can make contributions. Otherwise, an invaluable diversity of perspectives may disappear altogether from academic environments. In addition, diversifying the faculty and students in doctoral engineering and computing programs could help to reduce impostor syndrome, isolation, and other damaging psychological stress. Forthcoming research, programs, and policies should consider what Black students in STEM endure, because simply surviving racially toxic environments should not be the end goal.",Mcgee E.; Griffith D.; Houston S.,Journal,Teachers College Record,2019-01-01,Vanderbilt University's Peabody College;Vanderbilt University,
Guidelines for the implementation of UNE 166000 standards for R&D&I management in the Chilean municipal public sector,"Research, development and innovation (R&D&I) are essential activities, intimately linked to human beings and their organizational structures. Incorporating R&D&I in Municipalities translates into direct benefits and constant improvements for: communes, citizens, institutions, taxpayers, services and officials. Therefore, the lack of organizational norms and management tools that drive R&D&I could undermine the importance of innovative projects, and the loss of resources (human, technical and financial), minimizing the social impact of it. For its validation this proposal was applied in the Municipality of Vallenar (IMV - Ilustre Municipalidad de Vallenar). The results obtained indicate that the implementation of an R&D&I management system in municipal public institutions is feasible, highly necessary, and should be integrated to the Municipal Management Improvement Program, which cannot start without the corresponding diagnostics of R&D&I.",Meléndez Araya N.; Paz P.,Conference Proceeding,"XIV Jornadas Iberoamericanas de Ingenieria de Software e Ingenieria del Conocimiento, JIISIC 2019",2019-01-01,Universidad de Atacama;Municipalidad de Vallenar,Management system ;  Municipal Public Sector ;  Public Innovation ;  R&D&I Management ;  UNE 166000 standards
"Dynamic relationship between technology innovation of industrial enterprises and environmental pollution: A case study of zhejiang province, China","Industrial enterprises are rising in China, but their backward technological level, poor independent innovation capability, excess production capacity, and low utilization efficiency of resources and energy have resulted in serious environmental pollution. The overall technology innovation efficiency of industrial enterprises in China can be effectively improved to reduce the industrial ""three-waste"" discharge but only when the enterprises promote structural optimization and adjust themselves toward industrial services through technology innovation. The influence of R&D expenditures of large- and medium-sized industrial enterprises on industrial ""three-waste"" discharge was estimated based on the panel data of 11 prefecture-level cities in Zhejiang Province during 2005-2016. In addition, technology innovation measures for environmental pollution control of industrial enterprises were proposed. The results demonstrated that enterprise technology innovation has an environmental protection effect, and improved enterprise production efficiency contributes to the reduction of pollutant discharge. Besides, enterprise R&D expenditures in most cities in Zhejiang Province are negatively correlated with environmental pollutant discharge, and the influence is significant. Moreover, the technology innovation input of industrial enterprises can reduce industrial pollutant discharge in Hangzhou, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Huzhou, and Taizhou due to their good economic foundations. The study results in this paper have a direct and realistic significance in analysing the influence mechanism for the technology innovation of ecological environmental pollution of enterprises, promoting optimization and upgrading of industrial structures in different regions, and elevating regional environmental pollution governance level.",Ge M.,Journal,Nature Environment and Pollution Technology,2019-01-01,Zhejiang Shuren University,Environmental pollution ;  Industrial Enterprises ;  R&D expenditures ;  Technology innovation
The role of engineering education for innovation in the 21st century,"This conceptual paper first presents a synthesis of the central target and related concepts of five innovation policies from Asia. The paper then identifies how engineering education (EE) can help realise this target. Methods involved online, quantitative, key concept analysis combined with qualitative analysis of units of meaning. Analysis of the policies revealed that the overall target was social and economic prosperity. The prosperity is powered by a capacity for sustainability and inclusivity and by five other sub-categories of capacity as follows: human; relational; research and development; science, technology and innovation and; entrepreneurship and competitive. EE can contribute to social and economic prosperity by helping to build this capacity. Building capacity requires a shift from teaching as telling, to teaching as doing, from transmission of knowledge, to construction of knowledge, from teacher- to learner-centred learning and from didactic teaching to project- and problem-based learning situated in authentic, scientific, social and technological contexts.",Sunthonkanokpong W.; Murphy E.,Journal,International Journal of Innovation and Learning,2019-01-01,King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang;Memorial University of Newfoundland,21st century engineer ;  Capacity ;  Economy ;  Inclusion ;  Innovation ;  Progress ;  Prosperity ;  Social ;  Sustainability

The opportunity-driven innovation catching-up from China in engineering and technical services industry: Does technology gap generate opportunity gap in innovation?,"In the multi-case study, 14 latecomer firms from China in the engineering and technical services industry, which successfully accomplished the innovation catching-up, have been investigated. The key influencing factors of innovation catching-up have been identified and the relationships among these influencing factors have been detected. An 'Opportunity-Action' Model of innovation catching-up are build up. The research finding shows that the innovation catching-up of these latecomer firms are driven by opportunity, which is mainly shaped by the external forces but not decided by the internal technological (capability) factor. The empirical evidence and finding implies that the larger technology gap between the latecomer and the leading firms does not signify that the latecomer firms have fewer innovation opportunities in such context. In the innovation diffusion, at least as shown in this study of the engineering and technical industry in China, the technology gap does not directly generate the opportunity gap in innovation.",Ma J.; Xu Y.,Journal,International Journal of Technology Management,2019-01-01,Dalian University of Technology,China ;  Innovation catching-up ;  Innovation opportunity ;  Technology gap
Comparison of change management guidelines to address technology adoption barriers: A case study of higher educational institutions,"Emerging technologies are bolstering the development in the world in all the domains of the world. Education sector is an example of such innovation, by basing on which new means of pedagogy and andragogy are being explored with suitable models. The present study aims to know the difference in such models and the change management guidelines in addressing the barriers of Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) in Higher Educational Institutions (HEI). The students of the Department of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering (DEECE) of 1st year are selected from the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) are selected for the study using purposive random sampling. They are divided into two groups and are made to participate in a survey after providing some level of orientation about the change management models and the role of the model such as UTAUT and ADKAR. The opinion of the students is collected regarding the ability of the models to hedge against the barriers in the process of technology enhanced learning. The collected data is analyzed to check the means and standard deviation of scores and hence the difference between the opinion of the groups. To achieve this, t-test for difference of means with unequal variance is used. The results led to the acceptance of the null hypotheses that are framed basing on the research questions. Among the two groups of students surveyed, it is proved that the group that got exposed to TEL approach is able to understand the barriers in a better manner than their counterparts. In addition to the results, the draw backs of the study like limited sample size, clarity about the causality and ineffective participation of students are identified. Hence it is advocated to the future research works to overcome the limitations and to understand the role of the change management guidelines to address the barriers in the technology adopting as per the setting.",Khan H.; Smuts R.,Journal,Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology,2019-01-01,Qatar University;Cape Peninsula University of Technology,Adoption of Learning Technology (ALT) ;  Areas of Tension (AOT) ;  Awareness/Desire/Knowledge/Ability/Reinforcement (ADKAR) ;  Higher Education Institution (HEI) ;  Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) ;  Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT)

Effect of screw distance on combined profiles cold-formed steel in increasing the compression member capacity,"The use of cold-formed steel (CFS) as a frame in a single-story structure building system has been widely applied. However, the use of cold-formed steel for multi-story buildings is still constrained in the structure system, especially column. In the conventional structure, columns used in large dimension, height, h> 150 mm and thickness, t> 1.2 mm which makes the construction cost expensive. An innovation of cold-formed steel combine profile into one compression member unit is very interesting to study, furthermore, previous research provides information on a variety of cold-formed steel behaviors with small dimensions of height, h <150 mm and thickness, t <1mm, which can be developed into columns with greater strength. There have been a lot of research on behavior on cold-formed steel, but the study on screw optimization especially on combined profile to become compression member still need to develop. From the compression test on double profile back to back and flange to flange length, l = 300 mm and screw distance variation, 25 to 150 mm with 50 mm intervals, indicating a response similarity at screw spacing 25 mm, 50 mm and 75 mm, while the screw distance 100 mm, 125 mm and 150 mm experienced backline capacity.",Septiropa Z.; Hanim Osman M.; Abd Rahman A.; Mohd Ariffin M.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2019-01-01,Universitas Muhammadiyah Malang;Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,

The topics dynamics in knowledge management research,"The intellectual structure of an academic discipline can be viewed as a set of interacting topics evolving over time. Dynamics of those topics i.e. changes in their popularity and impact is the subject of special attention because it reflects a shift in actual researchers’ interest. This paper analyzes topics of knowledge management (KM) on the base of the topic modeling technique (namely Latent Dirichlet Allocation). Studying the flow of academic publications in 7 leading journals in 2010–2018, we identified 8 topics that concern different aspects of knowledge management science. Three topics, what focus on the social aspects of knowledge management (namely the context supporting knowledge transfer, the employees’ incentives to share knowledge, and innovation), grow in terms of popularity and impact. Opposite, popularity and impact of topics, which focus on the practice of the knowledge management and organizational learning also as on the impact of intellectual capital on performance, decline. It is consistent with the opinion of other researchers that in the contemporary flow of scientific publication role of KM is identified more as a social process than a management engineering method.",Zelenkov Y.,Book Series,Communications in Computer and Information Science,2019-01-01,HSE University,Bibliometrics ;  Knowledge management ;  LDA ;  Topic modeling

Predicting Cyberbullying on Social Media in the Big Data Era Using Machine Learning Algorithms: Review of Literature and Open Challenges,"Prior to the innovation of information communication technologies (ICT), social interactions evolved within small cultural boundaries such as geo spatial locations. The recent developments of communication technologies have considerably transcended the temporal and spatial limitations of traditional communications. These social technologies have created a revolution in user-generated information, online human networks, and rich human behavior-related data. However, the misuse of social technologies such as social media (SM) platforms, has introduced a new form of aggression and violence that occurs exclusively online. A new means of demonstrating aggressive behavior in SM websites are highlighted in this paper. The motivations for the construction of prediction models to fight aggressive behavior in SM are also outlined. We comprehensively review cyberbullying prediction models and identify the main issues related to the construction of cyberbullying prediction models in SM. This paper provides insights on the overall process for cyberbullying detection and most importantly overviews the methodology. Though data collection and feature engineering process has been elaborated, yet most of the emphasis is on feature selection algorithms and then using various machine learning algorithms for prediction of cyberbullying behaviors.

The antenna supporting arm is a slender structure that exhibits a certain flexible deformation during the deployment process of the antenna. A dynamic deployment model of supporting arms based on the absolute node coordinate formulation is established. In addition, based on the Lagrange equation, dynamic equations of multibody systems, including equations describing friction and flexible cable nets, are built. Furthermore, the optimal deployment process law of the antenna is developed. Finally, the performance of the deployment process of the antenna supporting arms and space deployable antenna is analyzed by the numerical simulation, which lays a solid foundation for subsequent prototype development and control theory research.",Lu S.; Qi X.; Hu Y.; Li B.; Zhang J.,Journal,IEEE Access,2019-01-01,Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology;Universität Hamburg;Harbin Institute of Technology,antenna supporting arms ;  Deployable antenna ;  dynamic analysis ;  dynamic modeling ;  optimal planning
Changes in organizations due to management mechanization (case studies of life insurance companies in Japan),"This research looks back at the history of Japan’s management machinery and explores how innovation during those times brought about changes and impacted organizations and human resource development. In addition, this research explores characteristics from the viewpoint of management information systems and office automation. Further, this research focuses on the life insurance industry in Japan and explores from the perspective of management information systems and office automation. The purpose of this research is to derive clues as to how to adapt the organization and human resources to next-generation technological innovation. About a century ago, organizations advanced mechanization and the recording of information during times when the world situation in politics, economics, and finance was worse than now. This research positioned the introduction of mechanization and that of artificial intelligence as synonyms, which, strictly speaking, should have a limitation. However, there is much to learn about the adaptation of information technology from the advocates of Japan, as Japan had been economically stagnant after the war, and is now a major IT nation in the world.",Norikumo S.,Book Series,"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies",2019-01-01,Osaka University of Commerce,Artificial intelligence ;  Management information systems ;  Organizational decision-making ;  Organizations

Speeding up innovation processes in agricultural engineering through user-centred design and multi-actor approach,"Innovation processes in agricultural engineering face factors that slow down or even abort them. This is the case also for the application and embedding phases. If not widely applied in practice, the innovations do not give their full potential. If the process is totally aborted, all the investments in research and prototyping are done in vain, and the projected benefits of the new solutions are not realized at all. To avoid unnecessary losses, it is important that users accept the developed products. The technologies need first to be purchased, and then used in a proper manner so that their benefits are realized, so that the users return to buy again. According to recent research, an important buying criterion of new solutions in agriculture is usability. Usable products have a good combination of ease-of-use, learnability, and efficiency. They also operate with few errors. Finally, they are subjectively pleasing. User-Centred Design (UCD) is a methodology for designing usable technologies and services. It is widely utilized to ensure better end-user acceptance. Inclusion of end-users in innovation makes the products more suitable for the users' variable situations. UCD also builds the users' trust on the solutions. Eventually, UCD reduces the need for iteration in the process, thus speeding up the innovation. Multi-Actor Approach (MAA) brings different kinds of people together to develop solutions. Best results are achieved when the participants have long enough cognitive distances. MAA speeds up the innovation processes as the products have been assessed from several angles. The probability for reaching a winning product arises. In the paper examples are given on UCD and MAA in the design of agricultural solutions. Two projects of the author, an OECD-CRP and an H2020 funded research on how to speed up and support innovation in agriculture, are referred. Recommendations on how to enhance the usage of these methods are given.",Haapala H.,Conference Proceeding,Engineering for Rural Development,2019-01-01,Agrinnotech,Agriculture ;  Engineering ;  Innovation ;  Multi-Actor Approach ;  User-Centred Design
"Exploring Dynamics and Structure of Biomolecules, Cryoprotectants, and Water Using Molecular Dynamics Simulations: Implications for Biostabilization and Biopreservation","Successful stabilization and preservation of biological materials often utilize low temperatures and dehydration to arrest molecular motion. Cryoprotectants are routinely employed to help the biological entities survive the physicochemical and mechanical stresses induced by cold or dryness. Molecular interactions between biomolecules, cryoprotectants, and water fundamentally determine the outcomes of preservation. The optimization of assays using the empirical approach is often limited in structural and temporal resolution, whereas classical molecular dynamics simulations can provide a cost-effective glimpse into the atomic-level structure and interaction of individual molecules that dictate macroscopic behavior. Computational research on biomolecules, cryoprotectants, and water has provided invaluable insights into the development of new cryoprotectants and the optimization of preservation methods. We describe the rapidly evolving state of the art of molecular simulations of these complex systems, summarize the molecular-scale protective and stabilizing mechanisms, and discuss the challenges that motivate continued innovation in this field.",Weng L.; Stott S.; Toner M.,Book Series,Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering,2019-01-01,Massachusetts General Hospital;Shriners Hospitals for Children;Harvard Medical School,anhydrobiosis ;  cryopreservation ;  hydrogen bond ;  molecular modeling ;  protein stabilization ;  trehalose
New Sensor and Wearable Technologies to Aid in the Diagnosis and Treatment Monitoring of Parkinson's Disease,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative disorder of the brain characterized by the impairment of the nigrostriatal system. This impairment leads to specific motor manifestations (i.e., bradykinesia, tremor, and rigidity) that are assessed through clinical examination, scales, and patient-reported outcomes. New sensor-based and wearable technologies are progressively revolutionizing PD care by objectively measuring these manifestations and improving PD diagnosis and treatment monitoring. However, their use is still limited in clinical practice, perhaps because of the absence of external validation and standards for their continuous use at home. In the near future, these systems will progressively complement traditional tools and revolutionize the way we diagnose and monitor patients with PD.",Monje M.; Foffani G.; Obeso J.; Sánchez-Ferro A.,Book Series,Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering,2019-01-01,HM Puerta del Sur;Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas;Universidad Autónoma de Madrid;Massachusetts Institute of Technology;Hospital Nacional de Paraplejicos,biomedical ;  movement disorders ;  Parkinson's disease ;  remote sensing technology ;  technological innovations ;  technology assessment ;  wearable electronic devices
"Unsupervised Machine Learning for Networking: Techniques, Applications and Research Challenges","While machine learning and artificial intelligence have long been applied in networking research, the bulk of such works has focused on supervised learning. Recently, there has been a rising trend of employing unsupervised machine learning using unstructured raw network data to improve network performance and provide services, such as traffic engineering, anomaly detection, Internet traffic classification, and quality of service optimization. The growing interest in applying unsupervised learning techniques in networking stems from their great success in other fields, such as computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and optimal control (e.g., for developing autonomous self-driving cars). In addition, unsupervised learning can unconstrain us from the need for labeled data and manual handcrafted feature engineering, thereby facilitating flexible, general, and automated methods of machine learning. The focus of this survey paper is to provide an overview of applications of unsupervised learning in the domain of networking. We provide a comprehensive survey highlighting recent advancements in unsupervised learning techniques, and describe their applications in various learning tasks, in the context of networking. We also provide a discussion on future directions and open research issues, while identifying potential pitfalls. While a few survey papers focusing on applications of machine learning in networking have previously been published, a survey of similar scope and breadth is missing in the literature. Through this timely review, we aim to advance the current state of knowledge, by carefully synthesizing insights from previous survey papers, while providing contemporary coverage of the recent advances and innovations.",Usama M.; Qadir J.; Raza A.; Arif H.; Yau K.; Elkhatib Y.; Hussain A.; Al-Fuqaha A.,Journal,IEEE Access,2019-01-01,"Western Michigan University’s College of Engineering and Applied Sciences;School of Computing and Communications, Lancaster University;Hamad Bin Khalifa University, College of Science and Engineering;Sunway University;Information Technology University;National University of Sciences and Technology;Edinburgh Napier University;Taibah University",computer networks ;  deep learning ;  Machine learning ;  unsupervised learning
Architecture for the management of a remote practical learning platform for engineering education,"In the Scientific, Technological and Academic environment in which the world of today is developed, it is important to permanently update the instruments, platforms and elements with which educational requirements are met. In this sense, engineering is one of the disciplines with the greatest changes, emergencies and innovations per unit of time. Learning tools therefore require constant evolution to facilitate the appropriation of knowledge in an easy and continuously available way for students and teachers. So far it is clear that the intervention of laboratory practices as learning strategies, guarantee a solid education for students in engineering. These practices are the scenarios where the student verifies the theoretical knowledge and validates with real results the application of mathematical and statistical models, which are set around a specific learning in engineering. Continue the development of these activities not only in a traditional way, but including innovations that the same engineering allows from the use of different technologies is a challenge, which can be assumed with the application of the same discipline and be projected to other fields of the education, to facilitate personalized and asynchronous learning. This paper presents the design and architecture for the implementation and management of a new educational platform for the development of Remote Practical Learning experiences for electrical machine laboratories. This platform integrates the possibility of remote interaction with the machine and its connection, as well as obtaining test parameters through measurement interfaces and real-time visualization. In this way engineering and technology at the service of Engineering Education is used, which will increase access to higher education to a greater number of people and will make the educational experience much more pleasant.",Segura-Torres D.; Forero-Garcia E.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2019-01-01,Universidad Santo Tomás,

Emergence of three dimensional printed cardiac tissue: Opportunities and challenges in cardiovascular diseases,"Three-dimensional (3D) printing, also known as additive manufacturing, was developed originally for engineering applications. Since its early advancements, there has been a relentless development in enthusiasm for this innovation in biomedical research. It allows for the fabrication of structures with both complex geometries and heterogeneous material properties. Tissue engineering using 3D bio-printers can overcome the limitations of traditional tissue engineering methods. It can match the complexity and cellular microenvironment of human organs and tissues, which drives much of the interest in this technique. However, most of the preliminary evaluations of 3Dprinted tissues and organ engineering, including cardiac tissue, relies extensively on the lessons learned from traditional tissue engineering. In many early examples, the final printed structures were found to be no better than tissues developed using traditional tissue engineering methods. This highlights the fact that 3D bio-printing of human tissue is still very much in its infancy and more work needs to be done to realise its full potential. This can be achieved through interdisciplinary collaboration between engineers, biomaterial scientists and molecular cell biologists. This review highlights current advancements and future prospects for 3D bio-printing in engineering ex vivo cardiac tissue and associated vasculature, such as coronary arteries. In this context, the role of biomaterials for hydrogel matrices and choice of cells are discussed. 3D bio-printing has the potential to advance current research significantly and support the development of novel therapeutics which can improve the therapeutic outcomes of patients suffering fatal cardiovascular pathologies.",Charbe N.; Zacconi F.; Amnerkar N.; Pardhi D.; Shukla P.; Mukattash T.; McCarron P.; Tambuwala M.,Journal,Current Cardiology Reviews,2019-01-01,Adichunchanagiri University;Jordan University of Science and Technology;Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile;Ulster University;Zhejiang University;Adv.

Innovation and practice of geological modeling techniques in complex clastic reservoir of Bohai bay offshore oilfield,"Bohai oilfield located at Bohai Bay of China mainly consists of complex clastic reservoirs. Reservoir prediction is difficult especially in the deep depth oilfields because of low seismic resolution. In addition, how to quantitatively characterize the risk of new oilfield development and how to build a more elaborate model in the late period of oilfield development are particularly challenging. This paper developed an innovative workflow for complex clastic reservoir characterization of offshore oilfield. A modeling method based on sedimentary evolution simulation, which can provide modeling constraints, is proposed for deep depth oilfields. Through sedimentary evolution modeling and other information, reservoir and structure uncertainty are analyzed, then reserves scale and reservoir connectivity are evaluated through experimental design, geological modeling and streamline simulation; 3p models are selected lastly. A new method is proposed for building an elaborate model of old oilfield with less grid amounts. The fluid seepage effect caused by some small scale configuration units is characterized by a parameter similar to fault transmissibility multiplier data in numerical simulation model, for there is no actual modeling of the configuration units, so the operation efficiency is greatly improved. BZ3 oilfield is a deep depth delta oilfield. A geological model was established for exploration evaluation well placement, reserves evaluation and development plan research based on sedimentary evolution simulation and quantitative uncertainty evaluation, the reservoir prediction accuracy is greatly improved that is confirmed by new drilled wells. Through quantitative uncertainty evaluation, reliable geological basis was provided for engineering investment, which can avoid the investment waste caused by geological uncertainty. Q32 oilfield is a fluvial oilfield that has come into high watercut (86.7%). How to characterize the lateral accretion interlayer (often less than 1 meter) in model for fine remaining oil distribution prediction is difficult, thus the method mentioned above for old oilfield was used. Firstly, a conventional geological model was established, then the lateral accretion interlayer was extracted as interface from it based on configuration results, then the interface was used to extract the parameter named transmissibility multiplier data in the numerical simulation model; a software has been compiled to perform the whole process. Based on the method, more than 100 adjusting wells were disposed and better production results were obtained. These geological modeling techniques have been widely applied in Bohai Bay offshore oilfields in different periods of oilfield development, including BZ2, JZ2, KL10, CFD6, SZ3, and JZ9. This ensures that these oilfield developed with high quality and efficiency.",Ye X.; Huo C.; Wang P.; Gao Z.; Xu J.; Mao Y.; Mackenzie W.; Shi X.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the Annual Offshore Technology Conference,2019-01-01,CNOOC China Limited,
Maximizing tax incentives for offshore exploration and production efforts following the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017,"The tax changes introduced under the newly-enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""Act"") are complex, but various provisions can be leveraged to produce direct financial benefits for innovative companies in the energy industry. Cutting edge technologies and innovations related to offshore renewable energy, robotics, automation, oilfield digitalization, geotechnical engineering, and other technical areas are critical to the growth of the energy industry. Understanding how the new provisions interrelate is essential to maximizing the Act's valuable tax incentives for offshore exploration and production companies in the United States. The Act maintains the permanency of the Research and Development Tax Credit in § 41 of the Internal Revenue Code (""IRC""), reduces the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminates the alternative minimum tax for certain entities, limits the net operating loss deduction to 80% of taxable income, and repeals the existing carryback and carryforward provisions under IRC § 172. This paper will discuss the legal implications of the new Act and provide methods and tax strategies that will directly impact energy companies' return on investment and strengthen offshore exploration and production efforts. Perhaps most notably, since the Research and Development Tax Credit (""RTC"") remains permanent, companies in the industry may recover qualified research expenditures related to the development of new or improved products, processes, formulas, inventions, techniques, and software. The RTC is a highly valuable incentive that directly impacts a company's tax liability both at the federal level and in certain states. Because of the reduced corporate tax rate, the changes related to net operating losses, and the elimination of the alternative minimum tax for certain entities, this credit provides a powerful incentive for many energy companies. In addition, since the Act will soon require taxpayers to capitalize and amortize expenditures related to qualified research conducted outside of the United States over a period of 15 years, companies performing critical research in the United States may soon be able to realize an additional current year deduction if certain expenditures are characterized differently under IRC § 162. Creating a tax strategy that incorporates the RTC and related provisions in the Act may result in a valuable benefit to energy clients creating and utilizing intellectual property throughout the world.",Riebe C.; Sanchez A.; Blake Windhorst J.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the Annual Offshore Technology Conference,2019-01-01,ABGi USA,

Simulating Environmental Innovation Behavior of Private Enterprise with Innovation Subsidies,"By reducing innovation costs, innovation subsidies can help private enterprises convert their production modes to green production. Based on method of computational experiment in social science, we construct a dynamic model for environmental innovation behaviors of private enterprises to simulate their evolution process in different market mechanisms, product competitions, and innovation subsidies and explore the impact of different subsidy modes on environmental technological innovation behaviors. The experimental results show that, under actions of multiagents, the combination of market subsidy and technology transformation subsidy can achieve the highest utilization efficiency of subsidy funds. However, when level of innovation technology is low, the innovation process should be subsidized at the same time to improve the competitiveness of innovative products. Besides, according to the level of innovation technology, flexible innovation subsidy combinations can be adopted to optimize subsidy in the different stages. The experimental results are of great significance for increasing efficiency of innovation subsidy funds and promoting green sustainable development of private enterprises.",Guan H.; Zhang Z.; Zhao A.; Guan S.,Journal,Complexity,2019-01-01,Shandong University of Finance and Economics;Jiangsu University;Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences,
Innovative natural yarn manufactured from waste,"Circular economy initiatives aim to re-define growth to bring society wide benefits while inspiring research of natural alternative textiles and introduce new approaches in manufacturing. The creation of innovative ice-straw wool yarn and cloth is the focus of this paper. Entrepreneurs Bernadette Casey (Wellington) and Sally Shanks (Gisborne) of The Formary, wanted to make a difference in the environment and conceptualised the idea of transforming rice straw waste and strong NZ wool into yarn proposing the woven fabric had the potential to help reduce China’s massive air pollution problem caused by burning waste straw after the rice harvest and to use all of NZ’s mid 26 to 30 μ range wool [1].

Splitting failure mode in textile reinforced concrete,"Textile reinforcement is a key innovation in the field of civil engineering. It consists of rovings made out of thousands of filaments. To improve bond performance these textiles are impregnated afterwards with either reactive resins (mainly epoxy resin) or aqueous dispersions (mainly styrene butadiene or styrene-acrylate copolymers). Experiments carried out at the Institute of Structural Engineering at TU Wien showed the high potential of structural elements reinforced with epoxy impregnated textile reinforcement. However a spalling of the concrete cover due to high bond stresses could be observed in most cases, subsequently leading to premature failure of the test specimens. Based on this observation further tests on the bond performance of textile reinforcement bonded in high performance concrete were carried out using a special bond performance test adapted for textile reinforcement in particular. The research described in this paper shows that the roving geometry and the production process of the textile reinforcement is responsible for high splitting forces orthogonal to the textile layer, resulting in a spalling of the concrete cover. For further developments in textile reinforced concrete it is very important to understand the bond behaviour of textile reinforcement. All findings within this research are small steps toward reaching this goal.",Preinstorfer P.; Kollegger J.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the fib Symposium 2019: Concrete - Innovations in Materials, Design and Structures",2019-01-01,Technische Universität Wien,Bond behaviour ;  Longitudinal cracking ;  Textile reinforcement

Co-Occurrence and Cyclical Growth Law Analysis of User Innovation Knowledge Map Based on Temporal-Weighted Network,"The construction of user innovation knowledge map can clearly describe the co-occurrence relationship among innovative knowledge points. Different types of weighted knowledge map models have been applied by enterprises to promote their innovative knowledge development. Moreover, the temporal-weighted user innovation knowledge map can reveal the hidden hot knowledge network model accurately and reflect the general evolution law of the hot topic of innovation knowledge in a certain period. In this paper, we proposed a method based on a knowledge network for constructing the temporal-weighted user innovation knowledge map. In order to model the temporal-weighted co-occurrence relationship among knowledge points, we assigned different weights to the knowledge points at different periods. Then, we carried out centrality analysis and core subgroup analysis for knowledge points through using a time-dynamic analysis method to explore the dynamic laws. Based on that, we proposed the periodical growth rule of user innovation hotspots. It was convenient to predict the hot spots of innovation and grasp the pace of innovation. Besides, we conducted an empirical study of the 'Arduino' community, which is the most professional electronic enthusiast community in China. We applied the established model to explore the sensitivity and accuracy of the knowledge map after adding the temporal factor to the user innovation knowledge map, and we found out the evolution process of co-occurrence relationship between user innovation knowledge points. Finally, we concluded that it takes time to ultimately establish a core-edge innovation knowledge model to represent specific innovation fields. More importantly, the development of hotspots of innovative knowledge presented the general growth cycle of the four stages: the initial stage, the explosive development stage, the mature stage, and the recession stage. Discovery of this law has a major impact on the company's trending of the future 'frontier research' field and the entry choice of innovation.",Wang Q.; Wang D.; Bai G.; Yu Q.,Journal,IEEE Access,2019-01-01,Wuhan University of Technology,Co-occurrence analysis ;  collaborative creativity ;  temporal-weighted user innovation knowledge map ;  user innovation

Integrative leadership for technology innovation,"Leading teams to bring about new technologies successfully during fast-changing times can be challenging. In the current era, people are more connected than before and able to access knowledge, networks, equipment and services themselves without corporate structures and management permission. Industrial age management practices appear inadequate for technology innovation in the innovation economy, while the literature reveals surprisingly little evidence of research into leader competencies across the technology innovation process. This paper reports the results of an exploratory mixed-methods study involving successful technology innovation leaders who were identified through peer-referenced snowball sampling. Qualitative research triangulated expert opinions, case materials, workshops results and the literature to identify leadership competencies. A measurement instrument was developed for the quantitative research, which involved eligible respondents rating the significance of identified leader behaviours. Statistically significant relationships were found in a hypothetical competency model through exploratory PLS-SEM analysis. The results reinforced some previously identified competencies, and contributed to understanding and identifying additional innovation leader competencies, including integrative leader competencies, to lead technology innovation into the future.",Vlok A.; Ungerer M.; Malan J.,Journal,International Journal of Technology Management,2019-01-01,Stellenbosch University,Innovation process ;  Integrative leader ;  Leader competencies ;  Leader success orientation ;  Leading ;  Technology innovation ;  Technology innovation management
The Learning Factory - A New Stimulus to Enhance International Collaboration,"The paper describes a new stimulus using learning factories and an academic research programme - an M.Sc. in Digital Industrial Management and Engineering (DIME) comprising a double degree - to enhance international collaboration between four partner universities. The programme will be structured in such a way as to maintain or improve the level of innovation at the learning factories of each partner. The partners agreed to use Learning Factory focus areas along with DIME learning modules to stimulate international collaboration. Furthermore, they identified several research areas within the framework of the DIME program to encourage horizontal and vertical collaboration. Vertical collaboration connects faculty expertise across the Learning Factory network to advance knowledge in one of the focus areas, while Horizontal collaboration connects knowledge and expertise across multiple focus areas. Together they offer a platform for students to develop disciplinary and cross-disciplinary applied research skills necessary for addressing the complex challenges faced by industry. Hence, the university partners have the opportunity to develop the learning factory capabilities in alignment with the smart manufacturing concept. The learning factory is thus an important pillar in this venture. While postgraduate students/researchers in the DIME program are the enablers to ensure the success of entire projects, the learning factory provides a learning environment which is entirely conducive to fostering these successful collaborations. Ultimately, the partners are focussed on utilising smart technologies in line with the digitalization of the production process.",Darun M.; Palm D.; Athinarayanan R.; Hummel V.; Von Leipzig K.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Manufacturing,2019-01-01,Universiti Malaysia Pahang Al-Sultan Abdullah;Hochschule Reutlingen;Purdue Polytechnic Institute;Stellenbosch University,Horizontal ;  International Collaboration ;  Learning Factory ;  Star Network ;  Vertical Collaboration

Living Learning Environments,"Learning factories and innovation laboratories are current approaches for the qualification of participants from the field of Industrial Engineering. The focus here is on a transfer of knowledge from research to the manufacturing industry. For more than 10 years different learning concepts and scenarios in the working context close to value creation have been developed and tested in learning factories. The participants can experience new situations through different scenarios and learn from them. These concepts are already being used in vocational education and training courses. In innovation laboratories various technologies and scenarios are being investigated and tested. As an example, a well-known innovation lab in Stuttgart focuses on the working environment of the future. Various demonstrators are used to simulate and present specific scenarios from the manufacturing industry, integrating the respective stakeholders. In this paper, two learning environments are compared and evaluated with regard to their potential applications for qualification. For the analysis, evaluation sheets of training events in the Learning Factory advanced Industrial Engineering (LF aIE) and an exemplary innovation lab in Stuttgart have been used.

Precedent-based design as a case-driven problem-solving technique in engineering design,"In engineering design, existing cases related to a given design problem represent a rich repertoire that is used by designers, educators and students to establish a point of departure, present an inspiration resource, or justify a decision. In spite of their potentials, systematic methods to retrieve knowledge embedded in existing cases, extract information from them, and restructure this knowledge to initiate emergent designs have not been adequately articulated. Within the scope of case-based engineering design, this paper demonstrates how knowledge extracted from an analysis of a case can be retrieved, categorized and mapped into usable forms. The scope of this research is architectural design, but many of its proposed models can be used in other disciplines. The main argument of this paper is that using knowledge retrieval within a reverse engineering approach can inform new designs and facilitate their processing.

A new typology design of performance metrics to measure errors in machine learning regression algorithms,"Aim/Purpose The aim of this study was to analyze various performance metrics and approaches to their classification. The main goal of the study was to develop a new typology that will help to advance knowledge of metrics and facilitate their use in machine learning regression algorithms Background Performance metrics (error measures) are vital components of the evaluation frameworks in various fields. A performance metric can be defined as a logical and mathematical construct designed to measure how close are the actual results from what has been expected or predicted. A vast variety of performance metrics have been described in academic literature. The most commonly mentioned metrics in research studies are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), etc. Knowledge about metrics properties needs to be systematized to simplify the design and use of the metrics. Methodology A qualitative study was conducted to achieve the objectives of identifying related peer-reviewed research studies, literature reviews, critical thinking and inductive reasoning. Contribution The main contribution of this paper is in ordering knowledge of performance metrics and enhancing understanding of their structure and properties by proposing a new typology, generic primary metrics mathematical formula and a visualization chart Findings Based on the analysis of the structure of numerous performance metrics, we proposed a framework of metrics which includes four (4) categories: primary metrics, extended metrics, composite metrics, and hybrid sets of metrics. The paper identified three (3) key components (dimensions) that determine the structure and properties of primary metrics: method of determining point distance, method of normalization, method of aggregation of point distances over a data set. For each component, implementation options have been identified. The suggested new typology has been shown to cover a total of over 40 commonly used primary metrics Recommendations Presented findings can be used to facilitate teaching performance metrics to for Practitioners university students and expedite metrics selection and implementation processes for practitioners Recommendations By using the proposed typology, researchers can streamline development of for Researchers new metrics with predetermined properties Impact on Society The outcomes of this study could be used for improving evaluation results in machine learning regression, forecasting and prognostics with direct or indirect positive impacts on innovation and productivity in a societal sense Future Research Future research is needed to examine the properties of the extended metrics, composite metrics, and hybrid sets of metrics. Empirical study of the metrics is needed using R Studio or Azure Machine Learning Studio, to find associations between the properties of primary metrics and their “numerical” behavior in a wide spectrum of data characteristics and business or research requirements.",Botchkarev A.,Journal,"Interdisciplinary Journal of Information, Knowledge, and Management",2019-01-01,Toronto Metropolitan University,Accuracy measures ;  Classification ;  Dissimilarity ;  Distance ;  Error measures ;  Estimation ;  Evaluation ;  Forecasting ;  Machine learning ;  Modeling ;  Performance metrics ;  Prediction ;  Prognostics ;  Properties ;  Regression ;  Similarity ;  Typology
The Team Process Capability Model: A Sociotechnical Theoretical Framework for Understanding How Teams Interact with Their Environment,"Numerous examples exist where teams and organizations perform at a high level only to see performance decrease over time. This phenomenon can be observed in manufacturing and engineering organizations where teams provide value to organizations through the use of tools, processes, and procedures to address customer needs. The rapid acceleration of digital innovations aimed at making teams more effective have actually compounded these problems by increasing the complexity of a task while ignoring the capability of the team to harness these new tools. The aim of this paper is to provide managers with a theoretical analysis of how sociotechnical interactions influence team and organizational performance within a larger context of environmental demands. This paper will propose a team process capability model to explain how dynamic social and technical interactions coupled with organizational decision-making influence team and organizational performance. The model will illustrate how team social and technical system interactions are influenced by managerial decisions which subsequently influences its performance. The concept of requisite process capability will be introduced to the reader within the context of resiliency factors such as dynamic capability and environmental uncertainty. Academic readers can benefit from this paper through applying the concepts within this paper to future research related to sociotechnical and organizational interactions. Managers can use the information shared in this paper to improve his or her understanding of how team performance is influenced by such systemic changes as digital and technical innovations or system complexity.",Sexe F.,Conference Proceeding,Springer Proceedings in Mathematics and Statistics,2019-01-01,Southern New Hampshire University,Dynamic capability ;  Operational performance ;  Organizational resilience
"Moving away from the basic, adopting a new approach to the creative process","The role of creativity in Industrial Design Engineering’s design process is fundamental and indispensable. Without it, design loses its potential for innovation – the process through which ideas generated by the creative process may be implemented attaining commercial value. The impact a product has can often be attributed to creativity in the engineering design process. Design in the arts is often considered to be the creative process per se, whereas in engineering, it refers to a concise record or encapsulation of appropriate concepts and experiences. For this reason, creativity is now a key skill in the practice of engineering and an essential part of its training. The present article discusses theories of the creative process which have been proposed in the last century. The stage based model of the creative process is discussed and the evolution of these models is mapped out. Further perspectives are identified for upcoming research; bringing data science and creativity together in such a way will necessitate development in both design and models of creativity.",Quiñones-Gómez J.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Mechanical Engineering,2019-01-01,Universidad de Málaga,Creative process ;  Creativity ;  Design ;  Design methodology
Integrated approach to the innovation of technical drawing teaching methods,"Motivations for the research activity on teaching methods could be listed as: Institutional duty; reduction of evaluation costs; establishing convenient relationships between teaching, research and publications; developing educational programs for non-academic learners; consolidating learning outcomes. Teaching is the most commonly recognized mission of university, and evaluation has a cost in terms of time and resources, both precious: At least a portion of the exam, the one concerning factual knowledge, may be done in economies of scale. The most of basic technical drawing teachers works with very large classes and faces the dilemma of choosing what to sacrifice among teaching quality, research projects, earning opportunities, personal interests, etc. A possible partial solution to such a dilemma is to work on projects aimed at teaching innovation, so to create convenient relationships between teaching, research and publications. A further consequence of lowering the cost of evaluation would be to make cost effective a more tests and, consequently, to achieve less temporary learning. Not just simple notions but also skills and abilities. In this paper the authors presents a structured synthesis of teaching innovation experiences of a ten-year span.

"Coupling coordination of internet development, technology innovation and star hotel efficiency","The research on the relationship between the three systems of internet development, technology innovation and star hotel efficiency for the development of the regional hotel industry provides a reference for this article. Based on the coupled coordination model, the authors analyze the evolutionary relationship between the three systems using the spatiotemporal dimension. The study draws the following conclusions. (1) In the 31 Chinese provinces examined, internet development and technological innovation have a high relevance, and there is a trend in these systems of decline from east to west in the three-ladder distribution. (2) The development trend of star hotel efficiency first rose and then fell, which shows its susceptibility to national policy. The spatial pattern reflects high efficiency in eastern and western China and low efficiency in the central area. (3) Among these characteristics, the comprehensive efficiency and pure technical efficiency of the star hotels in the eastern region are the highest, while the scale efficiency is highest in the western region. (4) The degree of coupled coordination maintains stability overall despite fluctuations, with the overall direction being toward healthy development. The system coupling coordinated development is complex and diverse, and the coupled coordination span is large, with the coupled coordination degree decreasing gradually from east to west in spatial distribution.",Ruan W.; Li Y.,Journal,International Journal on Semantic Web and Information Systems,2019-01-01,Huaqiao University,China ;  Coupling Coordination ;  Hotel Efficiency ;  Internet ;  Technology Innovation
Hunger and sustainability,"This paper examines the problem of world hunger and discusses potential solutions to it. It reflects on the debate about whether transgenic foods should be used, which is more of a social controversy than a scientific one. Sustainability is considered a key driver for innovation that can be used as a basis for assessing the problem of hunger in the world, and the question is inseparable from its ethical aspects. Given that economic growth does not directly equate to human development, this paper states that it is necessary to address the problem of poverty and hunger from the capacity development framework according to human rights. Poverty causes disability by limiting human development; it creates the conditions for the violation of human rights; therefore, an institutional framework and social initiatives aimed at protecting the poor should be established. Finally, the main lines of research in the field of biotechnology are outlined, such as the development of genetically modified organisms and the need to continue defining methods, based on the development of capabilities. Such capabilities should be embedded in educational programmes, to establish guidelines that are incorporated into curricula as transversal orientations to be able to make sustainability a social reality.",Sánchez García J.; Beiro Pérez I.; Díez Sanz J.,Journal,Economic Research-Ekonomska Istrazivanja,2019-01-01,Universidad Católica de Valencia San Vicente Mártir,biotechnology ;  education ;  genetically modified organisms ;  Hunger ;  poverty ;  sustainability

Theoretical and experimental methods for lunar regolith/rock related mechanical issues in lunar minerals mining,"The moon possesses rich mineral resources, for example, titanium, thorium, uranium and thorium, as well as some rare minerals such as pyroxferroite and zircon that do not exist on the earth.The exploitation and utilization of those resources can effectively solve the current global issues of resource depletion and environmental damage, which has become the focus of the new round of global space exploitation competition.However, the special gravity, vacuum and temperature environment on the moon, together with the distinctive composition, structure and geometric characteristics of geological materials result in the individual mechanical behaviour and engineering response of lunar regolith and rock, which bring a series of unprecedented challenges on both lunar mining and base construction.In terms of space environment, the gravity on the moon is only 1/6 of that on the earth, the vacuum on the lunar surface exceeds 1.01×10-12 kPa, the highest temperature is up to 130℃, the lowest is -183℃, and the temperature difference is as high as 313℃.As for the lunar geological materials, the particle shape of lunar regolith processes typical porous and multi-hook geometric characteristic.The lunar regolith also has a very large particle size variation, and exhibits a typical regolith/rock mixed structure characteristic because of the existing of large lunar rock bulk.Both the lunar regolith and rock demonstrate significant titanium-rich and iron-rich composition characteristics.Therefore, the systematic understanding of the above factors induced mechanical behaviours of lunar regolith and rock is the premise for the safe and efficient lunar mining.Those mechanical issues include the behaviour of lunar regolith/rock under lunar gravity induced low stress level and low stress gradient, the behaviour of lunar regolith/rock under lunar ultra-high vacuum and extreme temperature environments, the behaviour of lunar regolith related to abnormal particle shape, and the behaviour of lunar regolith/rock related to the distinctive composition and structure characteristics.Therefore, several theoretical and experimental innovative research methods need to be put forward, which can effectively make up for the incapability and shortcoming of current research methods.In theoretical aspects, the stress gradient-related high-order mechanical theory for lunar regolith/rock needs to be proposed to characterize the behaviour of lunar regolith/rock under gravity induced low stress gradient.The mathematical representation and numerical reconstruction of lunar regolith particle is another theoretical innovation, which may help to reveal the complex particle shape of lunar regolith and its influence on mechanical properties.Furthermore, the abnormal particle shape-related multiscale mechanical theory for lunar regolith should be developed to build the connection between its microscopic particle shape and macroscopic mechanical behaviour.In the experimental aspect, both the terrestrial experimental techniques used to simulate the lunar space environment and used to prepare lunar regolith/rock simulants need to be carried out, which can provide a basic experimental platform for lunar mining related mechanical issues.",Zhou G.; Li R.; Yan K.; Zhao X.; Chen J.; Mo P.; Wang G.,Journal,Meitan Xuebao/Journal of the China Coal Society,2019-01-01,China University of Mining and Technology,Extreme temperature ;  Low gravitational field ;  Lunar mining ;  Lunar regolith ;  Lunar rock ;  Mechanical behaviour ;  Ultra-high vacuum
Development of critical thinking of master’s degree students using stem cases,"Introduction. Today, a modern state needs people capable to regular intensive implementation of innovative activity in order to keep competitiveness in a dynamically changing world that is undergoing a significant increase in the amount of new information and its fast obsolescence. The need of modern economy for innovators inevitably leads to the shift of priorities in education from memorising and reproducing of a specified amount of knowledge to the development of students’ independent thinking, which, accordingly, requires teachers’ certain qualities and critical mentality. The aim of the research was to identify the components of critical thinking important for innovative activity and search for the ways of development of these components in young teachers, entering a master’s programme Modern Natural Science. Methodology and research methods. In the course of the research, the methods of the analysis and synthesis of scientific and scientific-methodological publications devoted to the development of higher order thinking skills and the concept of STEM education (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) were employed. The assessment of the level of students’ thinking and its changes was carried out through diagnostic tasks and empirical observation of educational and project-based activity of undergraduates and school students. Results and scientific novelty. The key components of critical thinking for the implementation and realisation of innovative activities were identified: creative, rational, logical, reflexive and metacognitive. To assess the development of components, a set of problem-situational tasks (STEM cases) was developed. Diagnostic tools were introduced to measure the level of critical thinking skills formation. The authors described the methodology for working with STEM cases through the example of the development and presentation of hybrid technology of lifting the sunken ship with a damaged hull, based on the students’ understanding of characteristics of the aggregate state of water. The results of approbation of the presented methodology used in small groups at various educational levels prove that its implementation contributes to the development of critical thinking in students, if the plots of cues are based on real problems of science and technology, and the solution requires contextual use of educational material, building a mathematical model, generating rational ideas of new or improved technologies.

The teaching learning processes, through which the trainees should acquire a broad overview of the medical field and biomedical industry, a well-balanced combination of general and specific knowledge according to the chosen specialization, several technical abilities linked to modern engineering tools and a wide set of professional skills, have to be strategically planned and implemented. Among the existing teaching-learning methodologies that can be employed for providing such holistic training, project-based learning is presented here and illustrated by means of successful experiences. Trends in the field of collaboratively developed open source medical devices (OSMDs) are presented and main current R&D challenges analyzed. To illustrate the OSMD field, the “UBORA” project (meaning “excellence in Swahili) is highlighted as a paradigmatic example, in which research and training aspects are importantly interwoven. In fact, this Euro-African initiative is focused on the promotion of OSMDs by means of innovation through education, by the creation of a sort of “Wikipedia” of medical devices, the “UBORA e-infrastructure”, which also guides designers in the engineering design process and supports online collaboration through the process, and by the constitution of an international community of developers devoted to OSMDs. Results from project-based learning activities within the UBORA project, which include competitions, design schools and final degree theses, are presented. The “UBORA e-infrastructure”, with more than 100 open source biodevices concepts and prototypes already developed in collaboration by a global community of around 350 users, and shared through such online platform, are also analyzed.",Lantada A.,Conference Proceeding,"BIODEVICES 2019 - 12th International Conference on Biomedical Electronics and Devices, Proceedings; Part of 12th International Joint Conference on Biomedical Engineering Systems and Technologies, BIOSTEC 2019",2019-01-01,Universidad Politécnica de Madrid,Biomedical Engineering (BME) ;  Co-creation ;  Collaborative Design ;  Collective Intelligence ;  Open Source Medical Devices (OSMD) ;  Project-based Learning ;  Service Learning

In this paper a summer school supported by EIT Health is presented. Its main goal is to integrate clinical knowledge in the development of new medical devices, from ideas to post-market approval, in the clinics. Students were immersed in clinical centres where they had close contacts and engaged discussions with clinicians and patients to identify and assimilate clinical unmet needs. From this immersive stage resulted innovative solutions that were further investigated with the support of plenary lectures and by interaction with experts of the medical field, from clinicians to Medtech company representatives. This experience proved to have a positive impact on the student's understanding of the clinical development life cycle from research findings or new ideas into medical devices.",Ribeiro S.; Ricci M.; Von Der Lieth A.; Bayon Y.; Zeugolis D.; Pelayo S.; Marque I.; Pazart L.,Conference Proceeding,"HEALTHINF 2019 - 12th International Conference on Health Informatics, Proceedings; Part of 12th International Joint Conference on Biomedical Engineering Systems and Technologies, BIOSTEC 2019",2019-01-01,"Evaluation des Technologies de Santé et des Pratiques Médicales (METRICS);Università degli Studi di Roma ""Tor Vergata"";Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Besançon;University of Galway;Universitätsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf;Inserm;Medtronic",ClinMed Summer School ;  EIT Health ;  Innovation by Design ;  Medical Device ;  Training
Organizing medtech innovation with concept maturity levels,"This paper presents an integrative approach to the maturation of concepts in the field of Medtech Innovation by using Concept Maturity Levels (CMLs). CMLs have been introduced by JPL (NASA-Caltech) during the last decade to cope with the early phases of space mission concept development. Extending well-known TRLs, their strength is to evolve an innovative concept guided by an incremental set of assessment needs. The article draws on an on-going research led in France where CMLs are being tested as a methodology for structuring Medtech Innovation complexity. Exploratory results provide an emerging framework showing what could be CMLs for Medtech Innovation. They also provide insights of why and how they could be implemented as a solid basis to stimulate more formative and adaptive design and evaluation methods.",Béjean M.; Siqueira E.,Conference Proceeding,"HEALTHINF 2019 - 12th International Conference on Health Informatics, Proceedings; Part of 12th International Joint Conference on Biomedical Engineering Systems and Technologies, BIOSTEC 2019",2019-01-01,Institut de Recherche en Gestion (IRG);ENSCI,Concept Maturity Levels ;  Innovation ;  Medical Devices ;  Medtech
"Construction study of the Palace of the Children of Don Gome (Andújar, Jaén), managed through the HBIM project","Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a collaborative system used extensively in the design and management of the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industries. Current platforms manage the information as data centres (i.e. databases) related to graphical representations located in 3D parametric models. Today, these new technologies are nowadays being incorporated in heritage assets. This paper aims to establish a methodology, based on these efficient platforms, for studying built heritage, including historical and construction aspects by adding the chronology of those interventions made in the historic building. This case study is focused on the Palace of the Children of Don Gome, a historic building located in the city of Andújar, in Jaén (Spain). The interest of this case study lies in the historic innovations and areas added to this palace. Likewise, the collection and manipulation of the graphic information and data related to the interventions have been based on an interoperable 3D graphic model, which allows users to include all the related documentation from different disciplines associated with the conservation and heritage restoration processes. In this paper, the construction process carried out during the last restoration of the building is studied. Specifically, it analyses the last building intervention in 1989, in particular an area of the coffered ceiling slab in the northern nave, located on the first floor. Within this model, all the elements that constitute the roof of the tower, mudwall walls, slabs and coffered ceilings of the northern nave have been studied, using photogrammetry for data acquisition and 3D modelling, and these data are included in a 3D digital model of the building generated using ArchiCAD software. Moreover, the system will be used to improve the management of the information obtained during heritage maintenance, creating a record of the whole building life cycle. As well as the historical documentation and graphical research, and the analysis of the procedures carried out during the last refurbishment of the building, new building construction system proposals have arisen which have been modelled to fulfil the Level Of Development (LOD) 300. Further analysis of these construction solutions used provides knowledge of how large 16th century palaces were built, and the kind of restoration conducted by architects at the end of the 20th century. The results obtained show how current BIM platforms are able to record construction and evolutionary aspects of a building's history, by identifying all the original elements and classifying them before their demolition. Also, by making a detailed inventory of the whole coffered ceiling in which the position and the temporal order (original - later addition) of the elements are included, it is possible to virtually replace those elements in their original positions, reducing the visual impact of the intervention. On the other hand, multiple errors in projects based on graphical systems of representation, mainly Computer-Aided Design (CAD), may derive from contradictions in the official sources consulted, such as the plans of the cadastre, the city council, and those produced through manual measurement procedures. However, in this paper, real graphical documentation has been generated using specific 3D surveying techniques for capturing geometry and accurate measurements, as well as by utilising the BIM system.",Nieto E.; Moyano J.; García Á.,Journal,Virtual Archaeology Review,2019-01-01,Universidad de Sevilla,Archaeology of architecture ;  Arqueología de la arquitectura ;  BIM ;  BIM ;  Fotogrametría ;  HBIM (Historic Building Information Modelling) Project ;  Heritage information model ;  Modelo de información patrimonial ;  Photogrammetry ;  Proyecto HBIM (Modelado Histórico de Información para la Construcción)

A structural and architectural review of the ancient Persian domes and arches,"The remains of millenniums of culture and civilization can be found throughout Iran and the surrounding countries. Over several thousand years, the experience and culture of the Persian Empire carried into the Islamic era. Particularly between 10th to 17th centuries, Monuments, temples, mosques, bridges, dams, water tunnels, water mills, and other structures were built. Even though they reside in one of the most active seismic regions in the world, and have experienced major earthquakes for centuries, some of these structures are still stable. These masterpieces have been sources of research and inquiry about the structural stability, architecture, and the incorporation of the art, spirituality, and construction methods. The architects of these structures were expert in mathematics, geometry, and topography crafting in their era. They also had great knowledge about the climate, materials, and structural systems to assist them in creating the structures. The architects integrated structural principles into their design, maintained creative interaction with the environment, and incorporated robust engineering methods. The combination of structural elements, such as arches and domes, covered wide openings and long spans. This reduced the weight of the buildings by decreasing their mass and supported structural stability. The structural shape, materials, and other considerations lead the structures ability to tolerate the applied loads. Their shapes are inspired by nature and their architects' spiritual and philosophical ideas. The complexity of the geometries, along with the simplification of the concepts and methods, can be investigated by different professional fields. This paper reviews Persian historical buildings and bridges, and particularly some of the ones built in the city of Isfahan during Seljuq and Safavid dynasties between the 10th and 18th centuries of the Islamic era. This study basically focuses on architectural and structural philosophy and innovations based on time, location, and environmental considerations of the region.",Shadravan S.; Shadravan B.,Conference Proceeding,AEI 2019: Integrated Building Solutions - The National Agenda - Proceedings of the Architectural Engineering National Conference 2019,2019-01-01,The University of Oklahoma;Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University,Arches ;  Architecture ;  Domes ;  Historical buildings and bridges ;  Structure
A Responsive Templating Approach for Generating Collaborative Spaces,"The business world is a competitive world and the success of entrepreneurs and businesses today is linked to their ability to be inventive which, in turn, means that innovation has become increasingly important for businesses. One response to this has been the introduction of special environments, tailored to support innovation, namely Innovation-Labs (i-Labs). Research has shown that creativity thrives in spaces that are playful and customizable, rather than in the somewhat sterile environments of most workplaces. In this paper, we describe a Responsive Templating Model (RTM) for creating an online immersive collaborative business innovation space that can be customized and dynamically adapted to the needs of individuals and specific business innovation sessions. Our approach has been inspired by earlier pioneering work in innovation Labs, virtual reality, HCI, end-user programming and the World Wide Web. This paper presents a model that allows space and task reconfigurations to be undertaken by a facilitator using template interfaces that are both dynamic and extensible, so as to support human–machine and machine–machine interactions thereby enabling the creation of personalised business innovation spaces.",Salako O.; Gardner M.; Callaghan V.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,2019-01-01,University of Essex,Business innovation spaces ;  Customisation ;  End-user programming ;  HCI ;  Innovation-Labs ;  Product innovation ;  Reconfigurable spaces ;  Templating

Empowering IT organizations through a confluence of knowledge for value integration into the IT services firm’s business model,"Challenges in operationalizing business innovation based on information technology (i.e. advancing new technology from the lab to the business operations) affect the ability of IT organizations to implement and effectively exploit these technologies. In IT services firms, these challenges are often linked to conflicting priorities, integration issues, inadequate infrastructure capabilities and the availability of the required knowledge/skills. Sometimes insurmountable these challenges leave the firm incapable to incorporate emerging information technologies into their business model. At the intersection of knowledge-based theory of the firm and the theory of dynamic capabilities, the study draws insight from the two cases in IT services companies. We seek to understand mechanism required to manage the flow knowledge assets for successful integration of innovation, while assimilating the tacit knowledge of the customer as a major component in the value integration.

Open-ended evolution and open-endedness: Editorial introduction to the open-ended evolution i special issue,"Nature's spectacular inventiveness, reflected in the enormous diversity of form and function displayed by the biosphere, is a feature of life that distinguishes living most strongly from nonliving. It is, therefore, not surprising that this aspect of life should become a central focus of artificial life. We have known since Darwin that the diversity is produced dynamically, through the process of evolution; this has led life's creative productivity to be called Open-Ended Evolution (OEE) in the field. This article introduces the first of two special issues on current research on OEE and on the more general concept of open-endedness.

An open platform for modeling method conceptualization: The OMiLAB digital ecosystem,"This paper motivates, describes, demonstrates in use, and evaluates the Open Models Laboratory (OMiLAB)-an open digital ecosystem designed to help one conceptualize and operationalize conceptual modeling methods. The OMiLAB ecosystem, which a generalized understanding of “model value” motivates, targets research and education stakeholders who fulfill various roles in a modeling method’s lifecycle. While we have many reports on novel modeling methods and tools for various domains, we lack knowledge on conceptualizing such methods via a full-fledged dedicated open ecosystem and a methodology that facilitates entry points for novices and an open innovation space for experienced stakeholders. This gap continues due to the lack of an open process and platform for 1) conducting research in the field of modeling method design, 2) developing agile modeling tools and model-driven digital products, and 3) experimenting with and disseminating such methods and related prototypes. OMiLAB incorporates principles, practices, procedures, tools, and services required to address the issues above since it focuses on being the operational deployment for a conceptualization and operationalization process built on several pillars: 1) a granularly defined “modeling method” concept whose building blocks one can customize for the domain of choice, 2) an “agile modeling method engineering” framework that helps one quickly prototype modeling tools, 3) a model-aware “digital product design lab”, and 4) dissemination channels for reaching a global community. In this paper, we demonstrate and evaluate the OMiLAB in research with two selected application cases for domain- and case-specific requirements. Besides these exemplary cases, OMiLAB has proven to effectively satisfy requirements that almost 50 modeling methods raise and, thus, to support researchers in designing novel modeling methods, developing tools, and disseminating outcomes. We also measured OMiLAB’s educational impact.",Bork D.; Buchmann R.; Karagiannis D.; Lee M.; Miron E.,Journal,Communications of the Association for Information Systems,2019-01-01,Universität Wien;Universitatea Babeș-Bolyai;Jeonbuk National University;OMiLAB NPO,Agile modeling method engineering ;  Domain-specific conceptual modeling ;  Model value ;  OMiLAB ;  Open models
Sustainable business models: A review,"During the past two decades of e-commerce growth, the concept of a business model has become increasingly popular. More recently, the research on this realm has grown rapidly, with diverse research activity covering a wide range of application areas. Considering the sustainable development goals, the innovative business models have brought a competitive advantage to improve the sustainability performance of organizations. The concept of the sustainable business model describes the rationale of how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value, in economic, social, cultural, or other contexts, in a sustainable way. The process of sustainable business model construction forms an innovative part of a business strategy. Different industries and businesses have utilized sustainable business models' concept to satisfy their economic, environmental, and social goals simultaneously. However, the success, popularity, and progress of sustainable business models in different application domains are not clear. To explore this issue, this research provides a comprehensive review of sustainable business models literature in various application areas. Notable sustainable business models are identified and further classified in fourteen unique categories, and in every category, the progress -either failure or success- has been reviewed, and the research gaps are discussed. Taxonomy of the applications includes innovation, management and marketing, entrepreneurship, energy, fashion, healthcare, agri-food, supply chain management, circular economy, developing countries, engineering, construction and real estate, mobility and transportation, and hospitality. The key contribution of this study is that it provides an insight into the state of the art of sustainable business models in various application areas and future research directions. This paper concludes that popularity and the success rate of sustainable business models in all application domains have been increased along with the increasing use of advanced technologies.",Nosratabadi S.; Mosavi A.; Shamshirband S.; Zavadskas E.; Rakotonirainy A.; Chau K.,Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2019-01-01,Obuda University;Ton-Duc-Thang University;Vilniaus Gedimino Technikos Universitetas;Hungarian University of Agriculture and Life Sciences;Oxford Brookes University;Queensland University of Technology;The Hong Kong Polytechnic University,Adaptation ;  Business model ;  Circular economy ;  Climate change ;  Climate protection ;  Global warming ;  Mitigation ;  Research method ;  Review ;  State-of-the-art ;  Survey ;  Sustainability ;  Sustainable business model ;  Sustainable development ;  Sustainable mobility
How to improve impact reporting for sustainability,"Measuring real-world impact is vital for demonstrating the success of a project and one of the most direct ways to justify taxpayers' contributions towards public funding. Impact reporting should identify and examine the potential positive and negative consequences of the continuing operations of a proposed project and suggest strategies to expand, further develop, mitigate, avoid or offset them. Designing a tool or methodology that will capture the impact of collaborative research and innovation projects related to sustainability requires input from technical experts but also from experts in the domains of survey design and communication. Without survey design insights and testing it can be very difficult to achieve unambiguous and accurate reporting of impacts. This paper proposes six key recommendations that should be considered for those monitoring projects when identifying metrics and designing a sustainability impact report. These recommendations stem from a series of in-depth interviews about sustainability and innovation impact reporting with research project co-ordinators in the process industries (e.g., cement, ceramics, chemicals, engineering, minerals and ores, non-ferrous metals, steel and water sectors). Our results show that factors such as ambiguous terminology, two-in-one questions, the stage of the project, over-hypothetical estimates, inadequate formats and alternatives and lack of guidelines can negatively influence the data collected in usual project monitoring activities and jeopardise the overall validity of the reporting. This work acts as a guideline for those monitoring to improve how they ask for impact data from projects, whether they are introducing new impact metrics or evaluating existing ones.",Lesic V.; Hodgett R.; Pearman A.; Peace A.,Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2019-01-01,Leeds University Business School;Britest Limited,Impact reporting ;  Metrics ;  Process industries ;  Project monitoring ;  Survey design ;  Sustainability
Digital Health for Computer Engineering Classes: An Experience,"There are several teaching methods adopted in today’s engineering faculties. The traditional teaching-learning style with frontal lessons has proven to be more useful for theoretical aspects. When practice comes to play, laboratories and hands-on sessions are more effective on learning outcomes. Considering the computer engineering faculty, the “learning by doing” paradigm can be supported by the “learning by practice” and “learning by competing” approaches, by stimulating innovation and creative thinking and by developing experience in teamwork and project execution. In this paper, in the context of the project work associated to our computer engineering master degree course, we propose three case studies, parts of eHealth research projects currently under development and testing at our University in Southern Italy, each one characterized by specific constraints and issues to be addressed in order to find innovative solutions to such problems.

In relation to relevant energy storage systems, supercapacitor technology has drawn burgeoning interest in recent years owing to its environmentally safe and cost effective advantages. Especially, its high power density (>10 kW/kg), fast charge/discharge characteristics, and excellent cycle stability are highly beneficial in storing renewable energy. Currently, the rapid development of portable electronic devices and the expanding renewable energy systems have paved the way for energy storage systems to play an important role in human society. Many significant breakthroughs for the next-generation supercapacitors have been achieved in terms of material synthesis, device innovations, and multifunctional device designs. Therefore, this paper summarizes the latest progress on new materials and novel device assemblies. First, to fully assess the effect of device assembly on supercapacitor performance, five types of supercapacitor structures and their assembly principles are discussed in detail, including the three-electrode (also known as semi-battery) device, two-electrode supercapacitor, flexible solid-state supercapacitor, fiber supercapacitor, and planar (micro-) supercapacitor. Among them, the three-electrode system and the two-electrode device are still the most widely used types at present. The three-electrode cell is suitable for characterizing electrode materials or investigating the electrochemical storage processes. The structure of a two-electrode system is closer to an actual supercapacitor. Other specially designed cells, which are fabricated with the aim of meeting the requirements of flexible and lightweight energy sources, have also been proposed in recent years. The results indicate that the structural innovative design could provide a fascinating way to enhance the energy density of devices while also holding huge potential to enhance the compatibility between supercapacitor component and various portable or wearable electronic devices. A careful interpretation and rigorous scrutiny of the electrochemical characteristics of every supercapacitor is also conducted in this work. Moreover, the design principles for enhancing the supercapacitor performance are highlighted through a comprehensive analysis of the literature. The main challenges in the structural innovations for enhancing the electrochemical performance are analyzed. The solutions to overcome these challenges are proposed. Second, supercapacitors still suffer from a lower energy density compared with Li-ion batteries. Among various efforts to build high-performance supercapacitors in recent years, major improvements have been made in electrode materials with rational designs. This review article also examines the latest methodologies and performance evaluation metrics for several emerging electrode materials in terms of their improved electrochemical properties, including carbon materials, binary transition metal oxides (NiCo2O4, Ni3V2O8, and Co3V2O8, among others), transition metal chalcogenides/selenide/phosphide positive electrodes, and VN, Fe2O3 negative electrode materials. This paper also highlights the electrode material design principle, which is the fundamental understanding of the relationships between structural design, structural properties and components of electrode materials and their electrochemical performances. Moreover, we also summarized the latest contributions and progress in multifunctional supercapacitors, which include the transparent flexible supercapacitor, self-healable supercapacitor, piezoelectric supercapacitors, self-charging supercapacitors, and so on. Several methods to realize the abilities of transparent, folded, wearable, self-healable, and even self-chargeable supercapacitors with almost no performance degradation are discussed. This paper also analyzes the compatibility of a multifunctional supercapacitor with industrial manufacturing, and offers a paradigm for developing portable and wearable energy storage devices and systems. Furthermore, the operating principles, system design/engineering, and the rational optimization of the multifunctional supercapacitors are also analyzed in this review. Finally, the major challenges faced by next-generation supercapacitors, along with the future research prospects, are discussed at the end of the paper.",Ji C.; Mi H.; Yang S.,Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2019-01-01,Xi'an Jiaotong University;Xinjiang University;Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China,Device structures ;  Electrode materials ;  Multifunctional supercapacitors ;  Supercapacitors
The internet of things for smart manufacturing: A review,"The modern manufacturing industry is investing in new technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, cloud computing and cybersecurity to cope with system complexity, increase information visibility, improve production performance, and gain competitive advantages in the global market. These advances are rapidly enabling a new generation of smart manufacturing, i.e., a cyber-physical system tightly integrating manufacturing enterprises in the physical world with virtual enterprises in cyberspace. To a great extent, realizing the full potential of cyber-physical systems depends on the development of new methodologies on the Internet of Manufacturing Things (IoMT) for data-enabled engineering innovations. This article presents a review of the IoT technologies and systems that are the drivers and foundations of data-driven innovations in smart manufacturing. We discuss the evolution of internet from computer networks to human networks to the latest era of smart and connected networks of manufacturing things (e.g., materials, sensors, equipment, people, products, and supply chain). In addition, we present a new framework that leverages IoMT and cloud computing to develop a virtual machine network. We further extend our review to IoMT cybersecurity issues that are of paramount importance to businesses and operations, as well as IoT and smart manufacturing policies that are laid out by governments around the world for the future of smart factory. Finally, we present the challenges and opportunities arising from IoMT. We hope this work will help catalyze more in-depth investigations and multi-disciplinary research efforts to advance IoMT technologies.",Yang H.; Kumara S.; Bukkapatnam S.; Tsung F.,Journal,IISE Transactions,2019-01-01,College of Engineering;Penn State College of Engineering;Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,challenge ;  cybersecurity ;  Internet of manufacturing things (IoMT) ;  manufacturing policies ;  network science ;  opportunity ;  sensor systems ;  smart manufacturing ;  virtual machine network

To analyze the different approaches the contribution proposes a series of case study and the results of two applied research, the 1 to 1 scale pavilions Fusta Ròbotica and Digital Urban Orchard. The case studies are selected verifying the correspondence to the following parameters: the presence of a performance-based process through which explore informed architectures; the use of low-engineered and natural wood and the engineered one; the materialization of the digital model through innovative manufacturing processes, specifically robotic fabrication. The contribution allows gathering pros and cons in the three different investigative macro areas: performance-based design, material culture, and fabrication process. This analytical investigation helps to create a clear research scenario around the topic of digital wood design as well as the definition of an innovative pathway for future researches, looking forward the assimilation of these innovative concepts in the building construction sector.",Figliola A.; Battisti A.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering,2019-01-01,Sapienza Università di Roma;Università degli Studi di Camerino,Complex timber structures ;  Optimization of wood architectures ;  Parametric design and fabrication strategies ;  Parametric timber engineering ;  Wood design
The relationship between student attitudes towards technology and technological literacy,"Technological literacy is significant for the innovation-driven economy. Students' attitudes towards technology was for a long time considered a measure of technological literacy, but evidence on interaction with technological literacy components is still lacking. Moreover, students' attitudes are formed by a variety of direct and vicarious means. For the purpose of this study, a sample of 180 secondary school students was used for empirical research. The findings suggest that the students' interest in technology and the perception of the effects of technology are the best positive predictors of technological literacy, while traditional craft-based work and skills are the most negative predictors. This might reflect tediousness toward technology, perceived difficulty of technology or a weak aspiration for a future career in technology and engineering. The findings from this study provide a deep insight into technological literacy and the need to recognise individual teachers' critical influence in the classroom.",Rupnik D.; Avsec S.,Journal,World Transactions on Engineering and Technology Education,2019-01-01,Univerza v Ljubljani,
"ARIES 2018 – Infrastructure, Innovation, Outreach","This article has two outreach aims. It concisely summarizes the main research and technical efforts in the EC H2020 ARIES Integrating Activity – Accelerator Research and Innovation for European Science and Society [1] during the period 2017/2018. ARIES is a continuation of CARE, TIARA and EuCARD projects [2-3]. The article also tries to show these results as an encouragement for local physics and engineering, research and technical communities to participate actively in such important European projects. According to the author’s opinion this participation may be much bigger [4-27]. All the needed components to participate – human, material and infrastructural are there [4,7]. So why the results are not satisfying as they should be? The major research subjects of ARIES are: new methods of particles acceleration including laser, plasma and particle beam interactions, new materials and accelerator components, building new generations of accelerators, energy efficiency and management of large accelerator systems, innovative superconducting magnets, high field and ultra-high gradient magnets, cost lowering, system miniaturization, promotion of innovation originating from accelerator research, industrial applications, and societal implications. Two institutions from Poland participate in ARIES – these are Warsaw University of Technology and Institute of Nuclear Chemistry and Technology in Warsaw. There are not present some of the key institutes active in accelerator technology in Poland. Let this article be a small contribution why Poland, a country of such big research potential, contributes so modestly to the European accelerator infrastructural projects? The article bases on public and internal documents of ARIES project, including the EU Grant Agreement and P1 report.

"Rethinking sediments, tidal rivers and delta livelihoods: Tidal river management as a strategic innovation in Bangladesh","Many urbanised deltas face development challenges due to growing economies, populations and climate change. Changes in land–water strategies are often required, as ‘business-as-usual’ solutions are no longer sufficient. The aim of this paper was to study tidal river management (TRM) as a strategic innovation, and trace how it is appreciated by people and used in master plans to address congested rivers and waterlogging in Bangladesh. In this context, a strategic innovation can be categorised as having four features: (i) it is a fundamental reconceptualisation of business as usual strategies; (ii) it is rule breaking and reshapes markets; (iii) it offers value improvement for livelihoods; (iv) it is sustainable. The case study analysis was built from 17 interviews, a focus group discussion and numerous documents. The case analysis revealed that tidal river management is very different (local, natural, complex) from mainstream engineering strategies for tidal rivers and polder systems, and is strongly supported by local people for its potential livelihood improvement. The paper concludes that tidal river management has strategic potential, though is hardly recognised in master plans. To advance practice, reconceptualisations are needed that focus on the diverse benefits of TRM, such as restored tidal rivers, flora and fauna. Further research could elaborate livelihood models that thrive on these benefits, and evaluate their costs and benefits accordingly.",Seijger C.; Datta D.; Douven W.; van Halsema G.; Khan M.,Journal,Water Policy,2019-01-01,IHE Delft Institute for Water Education;Khulna University Environmental Science Discipline;Wageningen University & Research;Center for Environmental and Geographic Information Services (CEGIS),Delta management ;  Grassroots ;  Innovation ;  Planning ;  Silt ;  Strategic thinking ;  Transition
"The Project of the Rehabilitation of Holy Sepulchre’s Holy Aedicule as a Pilot Multispectral, Multidimensional, Novel Approach Through Transdisciplinarity and Cooperation in the Protection of Monuments","The Holy Aedicule of the Holy Sepulchre, an emblematic monument that has survived throughout the centuries, recently underwent a major and demanding rehabilitation under the responsibility of the National Technical University of Athens Interdisciplinary Team. The requirement for reinstating structural integrity to the Holy Aedicule, for preservation of the values it represents and for achieving a sustainable rehabilitation in a demanding environment, demanded a complex framework of cooperation between different disciplines and the religious and societal carriers. Innovations were developed and successfully implemented in order to assist in achieving the project goals, marking future trends in the field of monuments protection. The rehabilitation of the Holy Aedicule, through fruitful cooperation between engineering disciplines, evolved beyond a purely engineering achievement into an emblematic example of transdisciplinarity, where Holistic Innovation and Research are intertwined with Social accessibility and the Sciences of Archaeology and Theology, creating new paths into discovering the secrets of the Tomb of Christ.",Moropoulou A.; Korres M.; Georgopoulos A.; Spyrakos C.; Mouzakis C.; Lampropoulos K.; Apostolopoulou M.,Book Series,Communications in Computer and Information Science,2019-01-01,National Technical University of Athens (NTUA),Cultural heritage protection ;  Holy Aedicule ;  Multispectral modeling ;  Transdisciplinarity
Fragile Cultural Landscapes: A Regenerating Case Study in East Veneto,"The paper reflects on the case study of a reclamation landscape in the East Veneto region (Italy), framing it in the European strategies and policy about landscape and heritage: it will be taken into account what has till now been done by local government, first of all by the “Osservatorio del paesaggio del Veneto Orientale” respecting the European Landscape Convention guidelines, then the paper will point out both sustainable innovation and potentialities of this fragile territory. Further the paper will try to outline the digital infrastructures’ communication abilities in sharing knowledge, connecting them to main questions about preserving and promoting landscape and scattered heritage, again keeping in the background the European policies, mostly about digitalization. As regards the relationship between landscapes and heritage, it will be paid specific attention both on the called “Top-down” actions and on knowing and giving values from below, from “Bottom-up” practices. In fact, the two strategies are complementary, because the first—Presentation—regards the careful goal of informing and making heritage available in a way normally carried out by scholars, professionals and more in general experts in the heritage field. The second strategy, better known as Interpretation, refers on the other hand, to research and creativity activities and results generated in a heritage site. In such perspective, involving visitors as well local people and communities is crucial for interpreting and changing sites as cultural landscapes, into places where legacies of the past can turn to a resource for the future. Referring in a specific way to those last processes, as they are more innovative, the paper will illustrate, like an example useful to be applied, the recent experience of “Alpinescapes” web-platform, implemented to collect and share information about the cultural landscape between Lario and Ceresio lakes, and lastly, to map and merge Digital Cultural Heritage data from Italian and Swiss territories.",Salerno R.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering,2019-01-01,Politecnico di Milano,Alpinescapes ;  Cultural landscape ;  East Veneto
Big size highly customised product manufacturing systems: a literature review and future research agenda,"The paper presents a systematic literature review on big size product manufacturing systems in MTO and ETO environments. In particular, the analysis is focused on highly customised, big and heavy products, calling for highly engineering solutions. This kind of products are characterised by low-volume demand, complex material bills, need of more than one worker in the same workstation (caused by the component dimensions and complexity), multi-skilled human resources and large floor space requirements. The analysis involved 587 research articles published from 1981 to 2017 from 118 international journals in the area of production research and operation management. Finally, 160 papers have been individuated and clustered in three main research topic area: specification processes and product design, production planning and control, project portfolio management. Results indicate that research focused on optimising and managing a large-size product manufacturing system is gaining growing attention in the last ten years. However, product/process design, production planning and control and project management techniques still lack innovations and ad hoc methods, capable to take into consideration both in-house part feeding problems, both ergonomics issues present in this kind of manufacturing environments.",Zennaro I.; Finco S.; Battini D.; Persona A.,Journal,International Journal of Production Research,2019-01-01,Università degli Studi di Padova,big size product ;  customised products ;  engineering-to-order ;  make-to-order ;  manufacturing systems ;  project management

"Innovation through practice: The messy work of making technology useful for architecture, engineering and construction teams","Purpose: Through the study of visualizations, virtual worlds and information exchange, the purpose of this paper is to reveal the complex connections between technology and the work of design and construction. The authors apply the sociotechnical view of technology and the ramifications this view has on successful use of technology in design and construction. Design/methodology/approach: This is a discussion paper reviewing over a decade of research that connects three streams of research on architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) teams as these teams grappled with adapting work practices to new technologies and the opportunities these technologies promised. Findings: From studies of design and construction practices with building information modeling and energy modeling, the authors show that given the constructed nature of models and the loose coupling of project teams, these team organizational practices need to mirror the modeling requirements. Second, looking at distributed teams, whose interaction is mediated by technology, the authors argue that virtual world visualizations enhance discovery, while distributed AEC teams also need more traditional forms of 2D abstraction, sketching and gestures to support integrated design dialogue. Finally, in information exchange research, the authors found that models and data have their own logic and structure and, as such, require creativity and ingenuity to exchange data across systems. Taken together, these streams of research suggest that process innovation is brought about by people developing new practices. Originality/value: In this paper, the authors argue that technology alone does not change practice. People who modify practices with and through technology create process innovation.",Dossick C.; Osburn L.; Neff G.,Journal,"Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management",2019-01-01,Oxford Social Sciences Division;University of Washington,Building information modelling ;  Information systems ;  Innovation ;  Organization ;  Technology
A decision support system for identification of technology innovation risk based on sequential CBR,"To identify risks in the increasingly complex market is an important issue for the development of technology innovation enterprises. But it is contended that there is still a lack of effective methods to support the dynamic characteristics and knowledge reuse of the problem. In front of a variety of risk sources, utilisation of IT is necessary, and we introduce case-based reasoning (CBR) technique to identify new risks from cases in the past. However, extant CBR method has limitations on problems with dynamic characteristics. This paper provides insights into the dynamic nature of technology innovation risk identification, and designs a decision support system for identification of technology innovation risk, which contributes a novel extension of CBR to sequential CBR. In our framework, cases are represented as sequences of risk events, and similarity between cases is measured based on weighted event sequence pattern mining.

Analysis of adoption rates for Needs Driven versus Value Driven innovation water technologies,"This paper analyzes six case studies of new water technology innovations in the last three decades and investigates the differences in timelines for moving through the various stages of water technology commercialization. The concept of two different types of innovation was explored: Crisis/Needs Driven and Value Driven. It was found that the case studies that mapped to the Crisis/Needs Driven innovation moved relatively quickly compared to Value Driven innovations and in most cases involved new entrants. New entrants refer to new companies or start-ups that have recently entered the water technology market. The case studies, which could be mapped to Value Driven innovation, had a slower rate of technology diffusion, and they involved a combination of existing companies as well as new entrants. • Practitioner points • The paper identifies two key types of innovation: Crisis/Needs Driven and Value Driven. • Legislation was observed to be a key driver for the adoption of new technology innovation in the water sector. • The Crisis/Needs driven innovations studied were observed to diffuse through the Water Technology Diffusion model at up to twice the pace of Value driven innovation. • Crisis/Needs driven innovation typically involves disruptive innovation offered by new entrants, whereas with Value driven innovation, the solutions are provided by both existing companies as well as new entrants. • It is also observed that in most cases a technology that is adopted in order to meet a crisis or need in the market is more expensive at the outset compared with incumbent solutions. • While value driven adoption has a slower cycle for adoption, it presents a lower risk as it is less dependent on external factors and timing of implementation of regulations or the occurrence of some public health related or environmental crisis.",O’Callaghan P.; Adapa L.; Buisman C.,Journal,Water Environment Research,2019-01-01,Wageningen University & Research;BlueTech Research,Disruptive innovation ;  Innovation adoption ;  Innovation drivers ;  Sustaining innovation ;  Technology diffusion ;  Water innovation ;  Water technology ;  Water technology adoption

An investigative study on the application of different statistical tools and methods for optimizing the hole machining on polymer matrix composites – A review,"Machining is one of the unavoidable operation after the processing of any type of material. Because of the advancement in the technology and innovation in the materials area, the composite materials are replacing and occupying the traditional materials market rapidly. Among these composite materials, the Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composite materials are found to be technically and structurally competitive and are widely used in a number of engineering industrial applications. The machining of these composites is found to be a complex phenomenon due to the influence of a number of machining and material parameters related to machining. Since drilling is the most frequently applied machining operation on composites, many research works were done on the drilling of composites, which resulted in numerous parameters that have influence on the drilling operation, impact on work material and cutting tool damage, cost of machining, material removal rate etc. So, at the background, it was thought to have a review on the issues related to drilling on the composite materials, which could help the manufacturing sectors and researchers in order to enhance the productivity. Thus the aim of this technical paper is to provide a detailed study of various issues related to drilling of FRP composite materials. This paper also comprehensively addresses the success and the failures of drilling operations, the factors associated with the drilling operation, their impact on the various output parameters. In addition, this review paper also discusses about the influences of a number of machining parameters and their influence on machining.",Guruputranavar N.; Rao S.,Journal,International Journal of Mechanical Engineering and Technology,2019-01-01,Manipal Institute of Technology,ANOVA ;  CFRP ;  Delamination ;  DoE ;  Fiber Reinforced Polymer ;  GFRP

Role of short-term intensive activity as a precursor to design conceptualization,"‘Design links innovation, technology, research, business and customers to provide new value and competitive advantage across economic, social and environmental spheres’—the definition of design by the World Design Organization (2015). It also redefined the varying roles a designer needs to assume. On the other hand, many industries are working on an acute specialization in technological fields or expertise in which they are operating. Design has also shown such possibilities, e.g., human factors, packaging design. In response to the extremes, specialization and generalization, design education needs to change. The educational programs also need to address the need of a designer to quickly learn the intricacies of a new domain. Today a design student learns a variety of subjects seemingly unrelated to each other. Each subject demands an attitudinal change from the students. This paper presents two case studies of short-term intensive activities (STIA) which are introductory exercises in the form of contextual short-term goals.",Kanetkar M.,Book Series,"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies",2019-01-01,United World Institute of Design,Design education ;  Design thinking ;  Short-term goals
Towards an automatic engineering change management in smart product-service systems – A DSM-based learning approach,"The rapid development and implementation of smart, connected products (SCPs) in the engineering field has triggered a promising manufacturing paradigm of servitization, i.e. smart product-service systems (Smart PSS). As a complex solution bundle in both system and product level, its engineering change management differs from the existing ones mainly in two aspects. Firstly, massive in-context stakeholder-generated/product-sensed data during usage stage can be leveraged to enable its success in a data-driven manner. Secondly, the digitalized services, consisting of both hardware and software solutions, can also be changed in a more flexible way other than the physical components alone. Nevertheless, scarcely any work reports on how to conduct engineering change in such context, let alone a systematic approach to support the automatic generation of its change prediction or recommendation. Aiming to fill these gaps, this work proposes an occurrence-based design structure matrix (DSM) approach together with a three-way based cost-sensitive learning approach for automatic engineering change management in the Smart PSS environment. This informatics-based research, as an explorative study, overcomes the subjectivity and tedious assessment of the experts in the conventional approaches, and can offer useful guidelines to the manufacturing companies for managing their engineering changes for product-service innovation process.",Zheng P.; Chen C.; Shang S.,Journal,Advanced Engineering Informatics,2019-01-01,Delta-NTU Corporate Laboratory for Cyber-Physical Systems;School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,Data-driven design ;  Design structure matrix ;  Digitalization ;  Engineering change management ;  Product service systems ;  Three-way decision making
Theoretical and conceptual discussions towards creative lean design management in the construction sector,"This paper takes the first steps towards building a theoretical and conceptual approach for creative lean design in the construction sector. The paper argues the need to advance the current lean design management approaches in construction by drawing upon some of the established theoretical and conceptual models in creative engineering design and design creativity. The initial steps towards Creative Lean design methodology are proposed. The paper raises the related open research questions and potential future work, concluding with a brief discussion on the need for a ‘theory of assumptions’. The proposed approach is particularly relevant at a time when there are expectations of disruptive changes in the construction sector.

Building an argument for the use of science fiction in HCI education,"Science fiction literature, comics, cartoons and, in particular, audio-visual materials, such as science fiction movies and shows, can be a valuable addition in Human-computer interaction (HCI) Education. In this paper, we present an overview of research relative to future directions in HCI Education, distinct crossings of science fiction in HCI and Computer Science teaching and the Framework for 21st Century Learning. Next, we provide examples where science fiction can add to the future of HCI Education. In particular, we argue herein first that science fiction, as tangible and intangible cultural artifact, can serve as a trigger for creativity and innovation and thus, support us in exploring the design space. Second, science fiction, as a means to analyze yet-to-come HCI technologies, can assist us in developing an open-minded and reflective dialogue about technological futures, thus creating a singular base for critical thinking and problem solving.

Application and development of inertia cone crusher in China,"The inertia cone crusher has lots of advantages, such as big crushing ratio, fine particle size, material layer crushing, good passing tramp iron performance and stable technical index, realized open crushing circuit and simplified crushing flowsheet. The crusher was input to China's Beijing General Research Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (BGRIMM) from Russia's Mekhanobr-Tekhnika Research & Engineering Corporation at the beginning of the 1990s. This paper introduces that after years of absorption and innovation how Chinese researchers optimized and creatively designed about transmission mechanism, bracing structure, kinetic parameters, lubrication system, dust sealing system, damping system and hydraulic control system etc on the basis of keeping its advanced theory and unique structure, therefore the crusher's stability was raised and the usage cost was reduced greatly. Accordingly the inertia cone crusher in China has been widely used in many fields, such as mineral resources and the recycling of metallurgical slag.

Innovation-based processes of integrated and high-level processing of natural and technogenic minerals in Russia,"The state-of-the-art of mineral mining and metallurgy industry in Russia is characterized by high demand of nonferrous, rare, rare earth metals, and highgrade coal, on the one hand, and by involvement of natural and technogenic minerals with low content of valuable components, fine (nearly emulsion) dissemination of valuable components and close physicochemical and process properties. This calls for high-productive and ecology-friendly technologies for more efficient mineral beneficiation based on intensification of operating and new methods to extract valuable components from rebellious ore and technogenic minerals, relying on the last achievements of basic sciences, combination of dressing and chemico-metallurgical processes and using advanced pyro- and hydrometallurgical technologies. The transition to a new strategy of processing is only possible based on the new technological-mineralogical appraisal of a mineral raw material. Actually, the process mineralogy has a stock of modern high-resolution physical methods for analyzing composition, structure and properties of geomaterials, inclusive of micro- and nano-levels: - Identification of micro- and nano-size noble metals, and natural and induced formations on mineral surface; - Experimental validation of structural phase and chemical transformation of minerals under different energy input; - Justification of choice and mechanism of interaction between flotation agents and noble metals with complex material constitution; - Analysis of structural, phase and chemical transformations of sulfides and rocks under leaching. Thus, process mineralogy is an informational background for a unified theoretical approach to scientific justification of flowsheets of efficient mineral processing. The article gives a brief review of practices that have found application and proved to be of high economic efficiency. Such practices are: X-ray radiometry and photometry separation (Uchalinsky and Gaisky Mining and Processing Integrated Works of ALROSA); selective disintegration (equipment engineered by Mekhanobr-Tekhnika and IPKON RAS); process selectivity enhancement (IPKON RAS, Central Research Institute for Geological Exploration of Nonferrous and Noble Metals, Chinakal Institute of Mining, Siberian Branch RAS, etc.); bacterial gold leaching (Olimpiada MPIW, technologies developed the Central Research Institute for Geological Exploration of Nonferrous and Noble Metals, Nezhdaninsky deposit projects, etc.); combination processing at a mining and metallurgy plant (Norilsk Mining and Metallurgical Company, Yaregsky deposit projects and others); processing of waste: overburden, mill tailings, slag, etc. (Kovdorsky MPIW, Svyatogor JSC, Ural Mining and Metallurgical Company, plants designed by the Central Research Institute for Geological Exploration of Nonferrous and Noble Metals, Mining Institute of Kola Science Center RAS, Research Institute for Chemical Technologies); water conditioning in mineral dressing circuits (ALROSA, equipment by IPKON, etc.); utilization of process water (ALROSA, Ural Mining and Metallurgical Company, Severalmaz JSC and others). Thus, Russia this time has the academic and engineering background for development of efficient energy-saving technologies for comprehensive advanced processing in accordance with the world's standards, or even higher in terms of a number of the technologies, which has continually been highlighted by participants of recent international congresses on mineral processing.",Chanturiya V.,Conference Proceeding,IMPC 2018 - 29th International Mineral Processing Congress,2019-01-01,Russian Academy of Sciences,Economical efficiency ;  Mineral processing ;  Mineral processing practices ;  Mineral raw materials ;  Production waste ;  Tailings ponds
"Precision dairy edge, albeit analytics driven: A framework to incorporate prognostics and auto correction capabilities for dairy IoT sensors","Oxford English Dictionary defines Prognostics as “an advance indication of a future event, an omen”. Generally, it is confined to fortune or future foretellers, more have subjective or intuition driven. Data Science, on the other hand, embryonically enables to model and predict the health condition of a system and/or its components, based upon current and historical system generated data or status. The chief goal of prognostics is precise estimation of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of equipment or device. Through our research and through industrial field deployment of our Dairy IoT Sensors, we emphatically conclude that Prognostics is a vital marker in the lifecycle of a device that can be deduced as inflection point to trigger auto-corrective, albeit edge analytics driven, in Dairy IoT Sensors so that the desired ship setting functions can be achieved with precision. Having auto-corrective capability, importantly, plays pivotal role in achieving satisfaction of Dairy farmers and reducing the cost of maintaining the Dairy sensors to the manufacturers as these sensors are deployed in geographically different regions with intermittent or network connectivity. Through this paper, we propose an inventive, albeit, small footprint, ML (Machine Learning) dairy edge that incorporates supervised and unsupervised models to detect prognostics conditions so as to infuse auto-corrective behavior to improve the precision of dairy edge.

From technology assessment to responsible research and innovation in synthetic biology,"This chapter discusses our experiences with anticipatory governance in synthetic biology as a new and emerging engineering science of life. Our engagement with this field comprised a range of activities, in which we gradually moved from technology assessment (TA) to responsible research and innovation (RRI). As we argue, RRI not only builds on established forms of TA, but also challenges TA approaches as predominantly framed by a concern with impacts and the governance of risks. By shifting our focus to the purposes of innovation, RRI invites us to engage with technological innovation in new and more aspiring ways. Inspired by the notion of RRI, we have thus been moving in our engagement with synthetic biology from a technological options-orientated approach to a societal objectives-orientated approach. Both approaches we see as vital and complementary modes of sociotechnical integration, the first firmly established in various modes of TA, the second highlighted by the aims of RRI.",Stemerding D.,Book,International Handbook on Responsible Innovation: A Global Resource,2019-01-01,Dutch Rathenau Instituut,

Using Kano model to differentiate between future vehicle-driving services,"Services are constantly changing with the introduction of new technologies, which affect the service systems of both conventional and autonomous driving. New theories and technologies are also key factors affecting the design and development trends of service models and solutions. Major automobile manufacturers aspire to provide customers with unique services and experiences, resulting in a growing demand for systematic approaches to characterize customer behaviors and scientific methods to accurately interpret data stored in databases. This study proposes a scientific engineering and operation framework for driving services that enables conventional automobile manufacturers to re-evaluate their service models and solutions as they expand into the domain of autonomous driving, integrating customized consumer interactions and mass production efficiency to develop new technologies, and subsequently applying these technologies to innovate their driving services, form service innovation guidelines, and accelerate the development of smart applications for the automobile industry. A Kano two-dimensional model of quality was employed. A Kano questionnaire was administered to analyze consumers' perceived satisfaction concerning different service quality elements; the elements were then ranked in the order of requiring improvement to determine the elements that are essential in conventional vehicles. Finally, suggestions were proposed for improving the service quality of driving products and evaluating driver satisfaction. A total of 56 valid questionnaires were collected from potential buyers of four-door sedans. The questionnaire evaluated respondents’ perceived value and satisfaction of 30 product elements categorized into two groups (specific functions and intangible value-added services) across eight major quality dimensions (basic safety functions, multimedia entertainment systems, information and communication systems, value-added systems, active matching, automatic service systems, hardware–software integration, and customer service and support). In addition, Kano quality categories were statistically analyzed to elucidate whether significant differences existed between groups. Using the Kano quality categories, 30 design elements were classified: 10 as “attractive,” 7 as “one-dimensional,” 3 as “must-be,” 4 as “indifferent,” and 6 as “reverse.” Enterprises can effectively reduce customer dissatisfaction and enhance customer satisfaction based on the quality category of the product and the product improvement order proposed in this study. Relevance to industry: This study determined that using the Kano quality categories, enterprises can effectively reduce customer dissatisfaction and enhance customer satisfaction based on the quality category of the product and the product improvement order proposed in this study.",Ma M.; Chen C.; Chang Y.,Journal,International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics,2019-01-01,National University of Kaohsiung;Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology;National Cheng Kung University,Autonomous driving ;  Car steering wheel ;  Customer satisfaction ;  Feature ;  Kano model

The IT revolution and the globalization of R&D,"Since the 1990s, research and development (R&D) has not only become less geographically concentrated, but there has been especially fast growth in less developed emerging markets like China and India. One of the distinguishing features of the R&D globalization phenomenon is its concentration within the software/ information technology (IT) domain. The increase in foreign R&D on the firm side has been largely concentrated within software and IT-intensive multinational corporations (MNCs). This concentration is mirrored on the country side; new R&D destinations such as India, China, and Israel look very different in the types of innovative activity being done there than older R&D destinations such as Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Japan. In this paper we will document three important phenomena: (1) the globalization of R&D by US MNCs, (2) the growing importance of software and IT to firm innovation, and (3) the rise of new R&D hubs and the differences in the type of activity done there. We argue that the shortage in software/IT- related human capital resulting from the large IT- and software-biased shift in innovation drove US MNCs abroad, and particularly drove them abroad to “new hubs” with large quantities of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workers who possessed IT and software skills. Our findings support the view that the globalization of US multinational R&D has reinforced the technological leadership of US- based firms in the information technology domain and that multinationals’ ability to access an increasingly global talent base could support a high rate of innovation even in the presence of the rising (human) resource cost of frontier R&D.",Branstetter L.; Glennon B.; Jensen J.,Book Series,Innovation Policy and the Economy,2019-01-01,Carnegie Mellon University;Georgetown University,
Energy justice in the transition to low carbon energy systems: Exploring key themes in interdisciplinary research,"With the dual challenges of reducing emissions from fossil fuels and providing access to clean and affordable energy, there is an imperative for a transition to a low carbon energy system.

Proposing an innovative design based evaluation model for smart sustainable learning technologies,"The proposed evaluation model has been created from the principles of adopting a Design Based Research (DBR) approach. The DBR process has been reviewed in terms of its current limitations and then extended into a new paradigm and academic epistemology. The proposed framework explains the nature of all design-based phenomena and provides an epistemological postulate for a Design Based Evaluation research design and methodology. In creating this model the authors have considered various theories and research methods and methodologies e.g. Activity Theory, Actor Network Theory, Grounded Theory, Collaborative Protocol Analysis, Evaluation of Self-reflection. This synthesis of ‘theories’ has provided a structure in the otherwise unelaborated empty shell of DBR. Using the proposed Design Based Evaluation (DBE) Model it is possible to introduce and evaluate new learning technology innovations and at the same time explore its potential and make improvements for long-term implementation and sustainability. The authors in this article suggest that continuous improvement of technologies and support systems are needed in order to move forwards and not to lag behind, thereby ensuring a future of smart sustainable learning technologies.",Bhattacharya M.; Coombs S.,Book Series,"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies",2019-01-01,Hamdan Bin Mohammed Smart University;New Paradigm Solutions Ltd.;Global Association for Research and Development of Educational Technology,Activity theory ;  Actor network theory ;  Collaborative protocol analysis ;  Design based model ;  Design based phenomena ;  Design based research ;  Ethnographic research ;  Evaluation of self reflection ;  Evidence-based authentic learning ;  Grounded theory ;  Sustainable learning technologies

Transdisciplinarity as a core value: The richmond institute for design and innovation,"“Wicked problems,” as coined by Horst Rittel, are “difficult or impossible to solve because of incomplete, contradictory, and changing requirements that are often difficult to recognize.” Design thinking, a holistic process based on ethnographic research and iteration, has proven to be a useful approach to solving these multi-faceted problems. However, there are many deterrents to setting up a classroom environment conducive to wicked problem solving. Too frequently, design educators overemphasize technical skills, siloed academic structure prohibits collaboration, and rigid curricula leave no room for interdisciplinary courses. The Richmond Institute for Design and Innovation offers a BFA in product design. The degree is transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary, requiring courses in art, design, engineering, and business.

Designing and creating a prototype of robotic skeleton systems for computerized lower limb prosthesis,"Recent statistics reveal that more than 40 million people of all ages from all over the world suffer amputations, and only 5% of them in need have access to assistive products. Common causes of amputation include congenital deformities, vascular diseases, diabetes, and accidents. A prosthesis is an assistive device that is used to substitute and restore the normal functions of the missing part of body. A prosthesis can be either functional or cosmetic, and can be either attached to the body externally or implanted surgically. Without prosthetic innovations, lower-limb amputees are required to have ordinary ambulatory skills sufficient to perform the basic movement functions and the ability to stand, walk, sit, reach with hands and arms, and manipulate (lift, carry, move) light to medium weights. Unfortunately, some amputees are unable even to stand and use their prosthesis to meet their demand. It has been found that traditional prostheses are mostly passive products with limitations and drawbacks. Recent research suggests that a trend in the utilization of active actuators/prostheses can overcome limitations and drawbacks of passive prostheses. Major functions of active prostheses are real-time intent recognitions, control strategies, torque requirements reduction, and energy saving. This paper presents the design of robotic skeletal system of the lower limb for computerized prosthetic leg development. The major structure of robotic skeletal systems consists of lower-limb joints modules, kinematics sensors and kinetics sensors. By taking advantage of the modern microprocessor-based controllers and low-power transmitters, the new robotic skeleton systems are created with better control performance in nearly real-time basis, lighter weight, higher flexibility, greater range of movement around a join, and better safety. The preliminary experiments are performed to evaluate the new design of robotic skeletal system by measuring sensors data while walking on ground, and climbing up-down stairs. Findings indicate the new design of a robotic skeletal system can provide the useful biomechanics parameters, which can be used for the development of computerized lower limb prosthesis.",Auarmorn Y.; Yodpijit N.; Jongprasithporn M.,Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2019-01-01,King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok;King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang,Computerized lower limb prosthesis ;  Robotic skeleton systems

Determinants of SMEs financial performance: empirical evidences from wholesale of electrical household appliances sector,"The topic of performance is a recurrent theme in most branches of management, especially regarding concepts and levels of analysis. Nonetheless, only a small part of literature explicitly devotes attention to the causality effects between organizational behavior, business strategies or economic environment and (ex post) firm performance, such as firm size, firm age, social responsibility, ownership structure, market diversification, innovation policies, industry concentration or macroeconomic conditions. Overcoming this empirical gap, this study addresses the performance of SMEs operating in the wholesale of electrical household appliances sector. We also provide first-hand results regarding the relation between innovation, internationalization and Portuguese SME´s business performance. Our results show that family firms have a positive impact on the performance and total debt and crisis have a negative impact on the performance of companies operating in this sector.",Coelho R.; Duarte F.; Borges A.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,2019-01-01,Centro de Inovação e Investigação em Ciências Empresariais e Sistemas de Informação,Crisis ;  Innovation ;  Internationalization ;  NACE 46430 ;  Performance ;  SMEs
"Management of intellectual property, technology transfer and entrepreneurship: Analysis of the experiences of universities in Brazil and Chile","Nowadays, innovation, technology and entrepreneurship have been increasingly valued as generators of wealth, competitiveness and development of contemporary societies, thus composing the political agenda of developed and emerging countries. The objective that guided the development of this work is to analyze the practices of Intellectual Property (IP) management, technology transfer (TT) and entrepreneurship in teaching and research institutions in Brazil and Chile. For that, the Federal University of ABC, located in Brazil, and the University of Chile, in Chile, were selected. In July 2017, interviews were conducted with professionals from the areas of TT, IP, and entrepreneurship in both universities. The results showed that the two institutions face, in a period of maturity and consolidation, some challenges related to the extension of IP management mechanisms, consolidation of partnership practices with business actors, structuring of performance indicators that reflect the intensity of the efforts, results and performance of the actions in technology management and innovation in both universities.",Vilha A.; Ferreira F.; Baltazar L.; de Medeiros D.; Suen A.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,2019-01-01,Universidade Federal do ABC,Entrepreneurship ;  Intellectual property ;  Technology transfer ;  Universities
Linking sustainable tourism and electric mobility – Moveletur,"This paper approaches the permanent struggle that less favoured regions must deal with regarding economic opportunities, job creation, income and regional production increase. Since an increased demand for nature and protected areas is taking place in a more and more urban society, some innovation potential is emerging. The study we have developed is focused on sustainable tourism practices in a specific natural area (Malcata Mountain Reserve), using electric mobility, which is known for its zero emission, no polluting and noise-free travelling. The broader study is carried out under the Interreg Funding Program in the Moveletur Project. Our aims are to promote a model of sustainable and clean tourism for visitors of natural areas, to create a network of green tourism itineraries connecting sites of natural and/or cultural value using electric vehicles and to empower tourism sector entrepreneurs with a new added-value service for their activity. Joint work with other natural areas is required to increase results. After the project is finished (by the end of 2018) there will be an improved knowledge about natural and cultural values that natural areas hold and that can be used for visitors’ enjoyment. There will be a more respectful way of ‘doing tourism’ in natural areas and hopefully it will address employment creation and improved territorial competitiveness. Finally, tourism experiences will have more quality and the project will promote smart villages’ further development by using technological components.",Ramos G.; Dionísio R.; Pereira P.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,2019-01-01,Instituto Politécnico de Castelo Branco,Electric mobility ;  Natural areas ;  Sustainable tourism
Rehabilitation and product design: Towards the inclusion of people with disabilities through interdisciplinary collaboration,"In low-GDP countries, such as Brazil, many older people and people with disabilities rely on the public health system for access to assistive devices, which are important to support them to live healthy and dignified lives. However, many problems limit their access to specialized prescriptions and appropriate devices that satisfy their needs and expectations. This paper explores the challenges, contributions and results from an interdisciplinary collaboration between two different yet related areas of knowledge – Product Design and Rehabilitation – in education, research and innovation in assistive technologies.

Nonprofit organizations at the crossroads of offline fundraising and social innovation: The influence of promoter behavior on the success of donation-based crowdfunding through digital platforms,"The purpose of this research consists of exploring the extent to which the behavior of promoters or fundraisers - explaining the success of offline fundraising campaigns for charitable causes - may influence as well the success of donation-based crowdfunding (DCF) campaigns promoted through digital platforms. First, the literature on the influence of the promoter behavior on the success of offline fundraising campaigns for charitable causes is reviewed. Second, hypotheses are proposed linking the determinants identified in the literature to DCF campaigns. Thirdly, their explanatory capacity is measured through quantitative analysis based upon a database of 360 campaigns fostered by nonprofits via Microdonaciones, a donation-based crowdfunding digital platform, for the period 2012–2017. Logistic regression analysis is used to test the hypotheses proposed. Results confirm in the light of the promoters behavior, that fundraising campaigns fostered by nonprofits organizations for charitable causes behave similarly offline and online.",Salido-Andres N.; Rey-Garcia M.; Alvarez-Gonzalez L.; Vazquez-Casielles R.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,2019-01-01,Universidade da Coruña;Universidad de Oviedo,Charitable causes ;  Determinants of success ;  Digital platforms ;  Donation-based crowdfunding ;  Promoter behavior
Inventive methods in designing an environmentally friendly household appliance,"The paper looks at a concept of an eco-friendly household appliance. Owing to an innovative approach to the design process, the functionality of an existing product has been altered. Inventive creation methods have been applied to involve respondents in the search for innovative solutions.

Risk response strategies for collaborative university-industry R&D funded programs,"Universities are centers of knowledge in our societies and their role when it comes to innovation has become more important over the years. Companies have several reasons to engage in research collaborations with universities, namely to gain access to innovative technologies. University-Industry R&D collaborations are expected to play an important role in regional economies, and to fulfill the industry’s demand for innovative products, technologies and processes. However, the knowledge on what are the potential risks resulting from these collaborations and the risk response strategies to reduce the negative risk impacts and to enhance positive risk impacts is still limited. Thus, this paper aims to fill the gap in literature when it comes to risk identification and risk responses’ planning, by identifying, based on a case study analysis, 19 potential risks and 53 potential risk response strategies.",Fernandes G.; Martins A.; Pinto E.; Araújo M.; Machado R.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,2019-01-01,"Centro de Computação Gráfica, Guimaraes;Universidade do Minho",Program and project management ;  R&D funded programs ;  Risk identification ;  Risk responses ;  University-industry collaboration

Science and technology studies and engineering innovation: The concepts of future and diversity,"This paper seeks to demonstrate how engineering can benefit from science and technology studies. It focuses on four key issues: responsibility, sustainability, diversity, and public participation. Science and technology studies encompass a plethora of research concerning the various ways that science and technology relate to society. The main area for discussion is the idea that policy makers and practitioners in general must consider the social and the cultural context, alongside specific science, and technology issues. In other words, society, and culture - which constitute the framework for producing, using and engaging with knowledge - are embedded within the fields of science and technology, in multiple manners. It is therefore fundamental to develop innovation in a sustainable and coherent manner.",Araújo E.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,2019-01-01,Universidade do Minho,Diversity ;  Future ;  Innovation ;  Science and technology studies

A parametrization approach for 3D modeling of an innovative abduction brace for treatment of developmental hip dysplasia,"Developmental hip dysplasia (DHD) is frequently encountered in the pediatric orthopedic practice. DHD is characterized by dislocation of the femoral head in the acetabulum. In Brazil are diagnosed three times more cases than the world average (5–8 cases for 1,000 births). The lack of treatment leads to long-term morbidity, abnormal gait, chronic pain and arthritis. Early detection and treatment with a Pavlik harness results in improved outcomes. After 6 months of age, closed or open reduction with spica casting is required for 4 months to treat a persistent hip dislocation. Plaster is used for orthopedic immobilization due the low cost, moldability and good mechanical resistance. However, there are several risks and complications due to the use of spica cast in DHD treatment: Skin problems due to lack of adequate hygiene (itching, ulceration, dermatitis and infection), formation of pressure areas, plaster fracture (11% of cases) and fever. Digitization techniques have been explored for production of customized hip abduction brace by additive manufacturing. However, it is not possible to keep a child standing still to perform 3D scanning of the hip and legs region. The goal of this research was to develop an alternative approach for acquisition of the external geometry of the infant to create 3D model of an abduction brace. The parameterization technique created includes: The creation of a virtual 3D model of a child’s body using the MakeHuman software; Articulation of the hip region of the model to the position required in the treatment of DHD with the Blender software; Definition of the parameters required for the modeling of a hip abduction brace. A DHD pediatric orthopaedist approved the methodology created. Innovations in the area of assitive technology can bring many benefits to the user in the process of rehabilitation.",Santos N.; Artioli B.; Goiano E.; Gonçalves M.; Kunkel M.,Conference Proceeding,IFMBE Proceedings,2019-01-01,Universidade Federal de São Paulo;Universidade Federal do ABC;Hospital Municipal Dr. José de Carvalho Florence,3D modeling ;  Developmental hip dysplasia ;  Hip abduction brace ;  Parametrization
Architecture and organization of a computational system for the management of data from individuals with Parkinson’s disease,"The volume of data for monitoring wellbeing and health of individuals, and the number of devices used to perform tests in patients remotely, have grown substantially. Following this trend, over the past years we have seen an increase in the number of studies reporting the monitoring of the cardinal signs (e.g., tremor, stiffness and bradykinesia) of Parkinson’s disease (PD) during prolonged activities for hours or days. A major challenge in the area is to monitor the progress of the disorder objectively so that treatments can be customized. In addition, patients suffer from the lack of predictive information regarding their health condition in the future. In this context, customized systems, i.e., database, that can group information from the motor symptoms of PD are of paramount relevance. By using such systems, one can track the progress of the disorder and more importantly can use data mining for seeking hidden patterns in the data. To contribute for the organization and management of information obtained from patients with PD this research proposed the architecture and organization of a multiplatform system with customized user control, modules and permissions to manipulate information on each screen. This system has three modules, being the first for storing and organizing information from data collection with distinct types of data; the second for the management of information from the application of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS); and the third for promoting technological innovation in the area. These three modules in a single system can be part of the clinical routine of hospitals and research centers dedicated to the understanding, treatment and research in PD.",Folador J.; Chagas L.; Vieira M.; Andrade A.,Conference Proceeding,IFMBE Proceedings,2019-01-01,Universidade Federal de Goiás;Universidade Federal de Uberlândia,Biomedical data ;  Computational system ;  Parkinson’s disease
Facilitating creativity in interdisciplinary design teams using cognitive processes: A review,"Interdisciplinary, or cross-functional, teams have become quite common for engineering and design. Many of today’s scientific breakthroughs occur in interdisciplinary teams, as the increasingly complex problems facing society often cannot be addressed by single disciplines alone. However, fostering creative and productive collaboration in interdisciplinary teams is no easy challenge. First, leading creative teamwork is difficult by itself. Second, many of the factors that impede teams and teamwork in general are exacerbated in interdisciplinary teams as a result of differences between team members. In this paper, we will review the team creativity psychology and management literature, and discuss how cognitive processes that facilitate creativity can be used by engineering and design teams. Specifically, past research has shown problem construction that allows teams to develop a structure to guide solving ambiguous problems. Further, problem construction allows teams to develop a shared understanding of the problem which aids in later processes. While there is significant research on idea generation, results suggest that teams may not be better at this than individuals. In this review, we discuss how idea generation in teams can mitigate some of the issues that lead to this effect. Finally, team research has only recently began to determine what factors influence idea evaluation and selection for implementation.",Reiter-Palmon R.; Leone S.,Journal,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part C: Journal of Mechanical Engineering Science",2019-01-01,University of Nebraska Omaha,creative problem solving ;  creativity ;  design ;  engineering ;  innovation ;  interaction ;  interdisciplinary teams ;  Review ;  teams
Instructor approaches to creativity in engineering design education,"Creativity is essential in the engineering design process. Researchers, academics, educators, and engineering organisations all agree that further improvement is necessary in training methods for fostering creativity in engineering education. Even though studies exist about how creativity should be taught in engineering education, there is still limited research about the challenges of practical implementation. To address this gap, an action research project has been conducted in two undergraduate Mechanical Engineering design subjects at a prominent university in Australia with the aim of enhancing creativity during the problem-solving process. The study shows the many challenges that arose when enhancing creativity in engineering design education, and the issues that surrounded this implementation. Although teaching creativity to engineering students is a challenge, this study illuminates the difficulties of convincing the engineering instructors to embed creativity in the subjects they teach. Overall, the study found that instructors' understandings and beliefs about creativity influence their teaching approach and what they value. These influences were around four main areas: the instructors' focus on the design product being produced, their educational backgrounds and training, the subjective nature of creativity and their beliefs about it, and the performance mindset of the instructors. These findings suggest that enhancing creativity among engineering students is not possible until the engineering educators and practitioners understand and value creativity practice.",Tekmen-Araci Y.; Mann L.,Journal,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part C: Journal of Mechanical Engineering Science",2019-01-01,Swinburne University of Technology,Creativity ;  engineering design ;  engineering education ;  innovation ;  instructor approach
Leading creative research and development efforts: A literature review and proposed framework for the engineering domain,"We commonly assume that leadership is not critical to the success of creative efforts. Prior research, however, indicates that effective leadership is, in fact, critical to the success of research and development efforts that allow creative ideas to be developed into innovative new technologies. In the present effort, we examine the key functions that must be executed by those asked to lead research and development efforts. We argue that leaders, to ensure project success, must execute three key functions: (1) lead the work, (2) lead the people doing the work, and (3) lead the firm. The specific activities that must be executed by leaders, for example, evaluating the work, establishing a creative climate, and championing projects, are described. The implications of these observations for the assessment and development of project leaders responsible for creative efforts are discussed.",Mumford M.; Mulhearn T.,Journal,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part C: Journal of Mechanical Engineering Science",2019-01-01,The University of Oklahoma,creativity ;  innovation ;  Leadership ;  project management ;  research and development
SciChallenge: A Social Media Aware Platform for Contest-Based STEM Education and Motivation of Young Students,"Scientific and technological innovations have become increasingly important as we face the benefits and challenges of both globalization and a knowledge-based economy. Still, enrolment rates in STEM degrees are low in many European countries and consequently there is a lack of adequately educated workforce in industries. We believe that this can be mainly attributed to pedagogical issues, such as the lack of engaging hands-on activities utilized for science and math education in middle and high schools. In this paper, we report our work in the SciChallenge European project, which aims at increasing the interest of pre-university students in STEM disciplines, through its distinguishing feature, the systematic use of social media for providing and evaluation of the student-generated content. A social media-aware contest and platform were thus developed and tested in a pan-European contest that attracted > 700 participants. The statistical analysis and results revealed that the platform and contest positively influenced participants STEM learning and motivation, while only the gender factor for the younger study group appeared to affect the outcomes (confidence level - <.05).",Achilleos A.; Mettouris C.; Yeratziotis A.; Papadopoulos G.; Pllana S.; Huber F.; Jäger B.; Leitner P.; Ocsovszky Z.; Dinnyés A.,Journal,IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies,2019-01-01,"SYNYO GmbH;BioTalentum Ltd.;Linnaeus University, Växjö;Frederick University;University of Cyprus",collaborative learning ;  Computer and Information science education ;  computers and society ;  social and behavioral sciences ;  software engineering for internet projects ;  STEM education
