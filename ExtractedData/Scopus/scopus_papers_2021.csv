High-quality development of urban agglomerations in China and construction of science and technology collaborative innovation community,"China's urban agglomerations are the main area of national new urbanization, the strategic core area of national high-quality development and the responsibility area of carbon neutrality. The science and technology innovation plays an irreplaceable role in realizing the above main goals of urban agglomerations. How to promote China's urban agglomeration to achieve high-quality development and high-level protection of the ecological environment under the new development pattern, and gradually build a world-class urban agglomeration is a realistic problem to be solved. Based on this issue, during the 23rd Annual Conference of the Chinese Association of Science and Technology, with the theme of ""Science and technology innovation driving the development of world-class urban agglomerations and the high-quality rise of China's urban agglomerations"", the ""Regional Collaborative Development Forum and the Second China Urban Agglomeration Development Forum"" was specially set up, through systematic discussions of more than 50 well-known experts at home and abroad on urban agglomerations and science and technology collaborative innovation, it is generally believed that the development of global urban agglomerations of China has entered a new era in the 21st century, and the high-quality development of China's urban agglomerations has been promoted to an unprecedented strategic level. However, there are a series of practical problems in the development and planning implementation of urban agglomerations. In the future, the high-quality development of China's urban agglomerations must rely on scientific and technological innovation, and the construction of innovation-driven intelligence, carbon-neutrality, dual circulation and urban-rural integrated urban agglomerations should be the basic direction of high-quality development of China's urban agglomerations. We should further innovate the research work mechanism, establish a collaborative innovation community, and gradually build China's urban agglomerations into world-class urban agglomerations with high-quality development, high-level openness, high-quality life and efficient governance.",Fang C.; Zhang G.; Xue D.,Journal,Dili Xuebao/Acta Geographica Sinica,2021-12-25,"Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;Sun Yat-Sen University",Collaborative innovation community ;  High- quality development ;  Science and technology innovation drive ;  Urban agglomerations

A review of the research and application progress of new types of concrete-filled FRP tubular members,"In recent decades, fibre-reinforced polymers (FRPs) have received extensive attention from the civil engineering field due to their light weight, high strength, corrosion resistance, fatigue resistance, and designability. The forms of FRP products used in civil engineering structures include FRP sheets/plates, FRP bars/cables, FRP profiles, FRP grids, and FRP tubes. Among them, FRP tubes can not only be used as formwork for concrete pouring but can also provide lateral confinement similar to steel tubes; moreover, they have the advantages of corrosion resistance and nonmagnetic properties. Therefore, it is particularly suitable for newly built structures under harsh service environments. In recent years, extensive research on traditional concrete-filled FRP tubes (CFFTs) has already been widely carried out in terms of experimental tests and theoretical analysis, and scholars have turned their attention to innovations in the types of internally filled concrete. The concrete type has extended from ordinary concrete to sea-sand concrete (including seawater sea-sand concrete), lightweight aggregate concrete, recycled aggregate concrete, ultrahigh performance concrete, and alkali-activated concrete. In addition, in terms of the tube shape, a new type of curved FRP tubular arch has been innovatively developed. In light of the above, this paper comprehensively reviewed the latest innovative studies of FRP tube-reinforced concrete structures in terms of the filled concrete type and the tube shape in the literature, which can provide a reference for follow-up research and their actual application.",Dong Z.; Han T.; Zhang B.; Zhu H.; Wu G.; Wei Y.; Zhang P.,Journal,Construction and Building Materials,2021-12-20,"Key Laboratory of Concrete and Prestressed Concrete Structures, Ministry of Education;Nanjing Forestry University;Zhengzhou University",Compressive capacity ;  FRP tubular arches ;  FRP tubular columns ;  New type of concrete ;  Newly built structures

Research on the Cultivation of Software Engineering Graduates Scientific Research Ability Based on Whole Process Control and Management,"The cultivation of graduates' scientific research ability is not only related to their scientific research and innovation abilities, but also related to the quality of graduate education in China. The cultivation process for the traditional software engineering graduates' scientific research ability pays more attention to graduates' capability in engineering application. However, under the background of world First class universities and disciplines construction in China, more emphasis should be placed on cultivating graduates' scientific research and innovation capabilities. In this paper, the scientific research ability of software engineering graduates has been divided into multiple dimensions, including solid professional foundation, the ability to discover problems, the ability to analyze and solve problems, the ability to express the opinions of scientific research and comprehensive scientific research literacy. We propose a scientific research ability cultivating system for software engineering graduates oriented to whole process control and management, and implement it with seven graduates majoring in software engineering as cases. The results show that compared with the previous graduates' cultivation, the scientific research ability of graduates in 2020 has been improved faster in all aspects.

"Government corruption, market segmentation and renewable energy technology innovation: Evidence from China","Due to global warming and increasingly severe resource and environmental constraints, the role of renewable energy in reducing pollutant emissions and mitigating environmental degradation has gradually attracted the attention of all countries. This study examines the relationship between government corruption, market segmentation, and renewable energy technology innovation. The regression results show that government corruption can increase the degree of market segmentation, and both government corruption and market segmentation can significantly reduce regional renewable energy technology innovation. Further analysis shows that the improvement in market segmentation can lead to a negative moderating effect of corruption on renewable energy technology innovation. In addition, corruption and market segmentation have complementary effects on the impact of renewable energy technology innovation. The improvement of corruption level can increase the negative influences of market segmentation on renewable energy technology innovation. Similarly, the higher degree of market segmentation can increase the restraining effect of corruption on renewable energy technology innovation. Therefore, this study provides a valuable reference for all countries to accelerate the construction of regional market integration, break through interprovincial barriers, and improve renewable energy technology innovation.",Ren S.; Hao Y.; Wu H.,Journal,Journal of Environmental Management,2021-12-15,Nankai University;Beijing Institute of Technology,Dynamic panel model ;  Government corruption ;  Market segmentation ;  Renewable energy technology innovation
A Review on the Shape Memory Polyurethane and Its Nonwoven Progress,"As a fibrous material with engineering structure, nonwoven made by physical or chemical methods is a functional fabric which derived from textile technology. And the nonwovens have been widely used in various fields such as medical treatment, filtration and separation, civil and construction. Thus, optimizing the structure and enhancing the performance of the nonwovens are the urgently topics for the high-quality application. Nowadays, one of the shape memory polymers, shape memory polyurethane (SMPU) has been widely used in medical and health, aerospace, textile and clothing fields due to its advantages of easy processing, large deformation, outstanding shape memory effect and diverse sti-mulation methods. It can be seen that the combining the SMPU and nonwoven technology will maintain the original characteristics of nonwovens while providing the shape memory functions. This provides a drive for the innovation and upgrading of nonwoven technology, and also provides a basis for the high-quality application of shape memory materials. Presently, the preparation of SMPU nonwovens mainly include blending, direct-web-forming and post-processing methods. The blending met-hod can be divided into composite fiber web-forming and blending spinning. The blending method has an advantage of uniform of shape memory effect resulted from the of the fully mixed of the fibers or polymers. Besides, the direct-web-forming method can be divided into categories of electrospinning and melt blowing. The electrospinning has been widely used in the preparing of nano-scale nonwovens with light weight, multi-pore and low cost. In contrast, the SMPU nonwovens from the melt blowing process have serious properties i.e fluffy structure, small pore size and large porosity, and have be widely used in oil absorbing materials, filtration materials and sound insulation etc. Further, post-processing method mainly applied in the coating and solution has the advantages of simple operation, low cost, and excellent shape memory effect. However, the application of SMPU nonwovens still limited in the laboratory and serious bottlenecks should be overcome for the large scale industrialization and functional applications. In this work, the shape memory mechanism, classification and application are reviewed and the research progress of the preparation method is analyzed of the SMPU nonwovens for the purpose of further development and high-quality application.",Sun H.; Zhang H.; Li X.; Zhen Q.; Cui J.; Qian X.; Zhang Y.,Journal,Cailiao Daobao/Materials Reports,2021-12-10,Tiangong University;Zhongyuan University of Technology;Ltd.;Henan Key Laboratory of Medical Polymer Materials Technology and Application,Functional fibrous material ;  Nonwovens ;  Preparation method ;  Shape memory polyurethane
Systems approaches for postharvest handling of fresh produce,"Any systems approach to postharvest handling starts with the consumer. Three major issues confront handlers of fresh produce. Consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables is too low to promote health. Losses of fresh produce from farm to market are too high. Income for growers of plant crops is too low resulting in rural poverty around the world. Fresh produce travels a supply or value chain from the farm to the market. Chains are not systems. Links in the chains may fit the criteria of systems. Our original concept of postharvest systems needs reframing. Systems thinking is more appropriate than a systems approach for postharvest handling.We gain understanding using the scientific method, an engineering approach, and systems thinking. Scientists conduct research by reducing complexity, developing and refuting hypotheses, and replicating results. Engineering design determines needs, develops new designs, and deploys innovations. Systems thinkers study systems holistically, select models and methodologies, simulate activities, and share insights. Game simulations are effective means of understanding the complexity of a system. Critical systems thinking clarifies the interactions within a system. Then it unveils new ways to design improvements. Interactive leadership experiences involve management in implementing changes to improve performance. If improvement of fresh fruit and vegetable value chains focuses only on links in the chain, it fails to explore how the links interact. Advances in postharvest handling require greater use of systems thinking techniques.",Aggarwal D.; Shewfelt R.; Prussia S.,Book,Postharvest Handling: A Systems Approach,2021-12-09,"College of Engineering;Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences;College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences Athens Campus",Consumption ;  Engineering approach ;  Farm income ;  Scientific method ;  Simulation game ;  Systems thinking ;  Value chain
Growing pains – a case study from higher education,"Theoretical basis: The teaching case study is based on a (real-life) complex organizational and strategic context, and several bodies of literature may be used to interpret, analyze, explore and discuss alternative solutions. Among several relevant theoretical basis are (educational) leadership, strategy, institutional change, organization, practice orientation of education and organizational learning. The Instructors’ Manual gives suggestions as to how the case may be used in teaching and gives references to relevant literature. Research methodology: The teaching case study is based on participatory action research. The narrative of the case is based on empirical observations in form of a research diary recording events, dialogues and discussion with colleagues and organizational leaders during a five-year period. The case study is based on real proceedings. But, the narrative is generic, and names are anonymized, and organizational contexts and events are disguised. Any similarities to real institutions are coincidental. Case overview/synopsis: The case tells the story of Birk Grimson (PhD), a professional who returns to academia after many years of business practice in the private sector. He is struck by how different the work ambience is in academia and how bureaucracy and a rigid organizational structure seem to quell innovation, resulting in resistance to systematic learning, organizational development and strategic change. Complexity academic level: The teaching case study is appropriate for business, organizational or administrative students at master’s, PhD level or executive education. For students with other disciplinary educational backgrounds (such as engineering, education or health care), some basic knowledge of organization and management or alternatively relevant experience is recommended.

How are future energy technology costs estimated? Can we do better?,"Making informed estimates of future energy technology costs is central to understanding the cost of the low-carbon transition. A number of methods have been used to make such estimates: extrapolating empirically derived learning rates; use of expert elicitations; and engineering assessments which analyse future developments for technology components' cost and performance parameters. In addition, there is a rich literature on different energy technology innovation systems analysis frameworks, which identify and analyse the many processes that drive technologies' development, including those that make them increasingly cost-competitive and commercially ready. However, there is a surprising lack of linkage between the fields of technology cost projections and technology innovation systems analysis. There is a clear opportunity to better relate these two fields, such that the detailed processes included in technology innovation systems frameworks can be fully considered when estimating future energy technology costs. Here we demonstrate how this can be done. We identify that learning curve, expert elicitation and engineering assessment methods already either implicitly or explicitly incorporate some elements of technology innovation systems frameworks, most commonly those relating to R&D and deployment-related drivers. Yet they could more explicitly encompass a broader range of innovation processes. For example, future cost developments could be considered in light of the extent to which there is a well-functioning energy technological innovation system (TIS), including support for the direction of technology research, industry experimentation and development, market formation including by demand-pull policies and technology legitimation. We suggest that failure to fully encompass such processes may have contributed to overestimates of nuclear cost reductions and under-estimates of offshore wind cost reductions in the last decade.",Gambhir A.; Green R.; Grubb M.; Heptonstall P.; Wilson C.; Gross R.,Journal,International Review of Environmental and Resource Economics,2021-12-07,"Imperial College Business School;University College London;International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, Laxenburg;Imperial College London;University of East Anglia",Energy technologies ;  Technology cost reductions ;  Technology innovation policies ;  Technology innovation system frameworks
An urban sensing architecture as essential infrastructure for future cities,"Climate change and migration have become one of the most challenging problems for our civilization. In this context, city councils work hard to manage essential services for citizens such as waste collection, street lamp lighting, and water supply. Increasingly, digitalization and the Internet of Things (IoT) help cities improve services, increase productivity and reduce costs. However, to understand how this may happen, we explore the urban sensing capabilities from citizen- to city-scale, how sensing at different levels is interlinked, and the challenges of managing innovations based on IoT data and devices. Local authorities collaborate with researchers and deploy testbeds as a part of demonstration and research projects to perform the above data collection, improve city services, and support innovation. The data gathered is about indoor and outdoor environmental conditions, energy usage, built environment, structural health monitoring. Such monitoring requires IT infrastructure at three different tiers: at the endpoint, edge, and cloud. Managing infrastructure at all tiers with provisioning, connectivity, security updates of devices, user data privacy controls, visualization of data, multi-tenancy of applications, and network resilience, is challenging. So, in turn, we focus on performing a systematic study of the technical and non-technical challenges faced during the implementation, management, and deployment of devices into citizens' homes and public spaces. Our third piece of work explores IoT edge applications' resiliency and reliability requirements that vary from non-critical (best delivery efforts) to safety-critical with time-bounded guarantees. We investigate how to meet IoT application mixed-criticality QoS requirements in multi-communication networks. Finally, to demonstrate the principles of our framework in the real world, we implement an open-source air quality platform Open City Air Quality Platform (OpenCAQP), that merges a wide range of data sources and air pollution parameters into a single platform. The OpenCAQP allows citizens, environmentalists, data analysts, and developers to access and visualize that data.",Kumar V.; Oikonomou G.; Tryfonas T.,Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2021-12-06,University of Bristol,data monitoring infrastructure ;  IoT ;  urban sensing

Trent Brick Panel: Innovative envelope system designed according latest UK national fire and energy performance regulations,"In November 2018, following the Grenfell Tower tragedy in London, the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government (MHCLG) introduced an amendment to the Building Regulations 2010, which outlined stricter rules banning the use of combustible materials defined by the new Building Regulation 7(2). This change had a significant impact since early 2019, on the materials and systems that can be used in the construction sector. In 2020, the global pandemic caused by the diffusion of the COVID-19 virus represented a new challenge for the industry, with implications on programme certainty, material procurement, workforce management, moving towards offsite manufacture. The development of the Trent Brick Panel is set against this historical and social context. The envelope prototype is the opportunity for innovation that follows the turn of events. The offsite manufacturing of glass-reinforced concrete panel, mimicking several finishes, is the result of a design investigation carried out with the market-leading actors: developers, main contractors, subcontractors, engineering consultancies, architects, local authorities and warranty providers.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the interactions between university, industry and government of Iran in scientific articles in the field of medical engineering using the triple helix model. Materials and Methods: This is an applied research with a quantitative approach and uses scientometric techniques. The status of dynamic interactions of the main pillars of Iranian innovation in the field of medical engineering in WoS(Web of Science) database has been calculated using the .exe and the 4.exe softwares in the period of 2010-2019, and the transmission degree of uncertainty index in dual and national dimensions has been determined. Results: The T-index ranking was assigned to university-government(23.38 mb), university-industry(8.47 mb) and industry-government (1.13 mb), respectively, and finally, national interaction(-12.48 mb) was obtained. The interaction between university and industry had an increasing trend and the strongest dual interaction belonged to the university-government. Over the last ten years, national interaction has always had a negative value, which indicates the existence of dynamics in interactions in the national dimension. Conclusion: The dual university-industry interaction has been increasing in recent years; however, in the long run, the national interaction of the pillars has been facing a declining trend, according to which some science and technology policies, and research and industrial strategies have been proposed as a necessity to promote the university-industry-government innovation network in the field of medical engineering in Iran.",Sanij S.; Mostafavi I.; Zarghami H.; Soleimani H.,Journal,Journal of Payavard Salamat,2021-12-01,School of Allied Medical Sciences;Aeronautical University of Science and Technology;Yazd University,Biomedical Engineering ;  Government ;  Industry ;  Iran ;  Knowledge Economy ;  Triple Helix Model of Innovation ;  University
Eco-Friendly Concrete Innovation in Civil Engineering,"Recently, the weather changes that have occurred are very unconditioned. This feels natural because it has often been felt, even though the heat that occurs is beyond its limit. This is one of the effects of global warming. Concrete is one of the most widely used materials in construction. In fact, cement production is included in the less environmentally friendly category. The purpose of this study is to find out how research on green concrete and whether it has an impact in the world of civil engineering. This research is using a quantitative method. This research describes only a few of the results of trials conducted by several researchers in the world, which prove that there is environmentally friendly concrete that can be applied and some are not. The results of this study showed that most of the innovation of green concrete is not good enough to be applied in the field. This is because in several studies it has been proven that the mixture in the manufacture of green concrete does not qualify as an aggregate material. The conclusion is that there is no innovation in the manufacture of green concrete that has worked so as not to cause damage to the earth. Therefore, other research on green concrete is very necessary to do.",Ghinaya Z.; Masek A.,Journal,ASEAN Journal of Science and Engineering,2021-12-01,Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia;Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia,Concrete ;  Friendly Concrete ;  Mixture ;  Researches
"Building Information Modeling Deployment in Oil, Gas and Petrochemical Industry: An Adoption Roadmap","The implementation of Building Information Modeling (BIM) in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry is growing rapidly. The Oil, Gas and Petrochemical industry (OGPi), however, is still lagging in harnessing the BIM capabilities. Therefore, the main question of this research is: How and what actions should be adopted for deploying BIM in the OGPi? The research is divided into three parts as an action research. This study investigates the second part, namely preparation of an adoption roadmap for deploying BIM in collaboration with Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) in the OGPi. To achieve this goal, an extensive literature review including the most established roadmaps in the AEC industry and also the semi-structured interviews with the OGPi's experts are conducted. Then, an adoption roadmap is derived for OGPi via Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT), ‘Why, How, What’ questions (Sink model), strategic planning and innovation roadmap as well as the iterative process in the studies and interviews. The prepared roadmap validated by triangulation through focus group meetings and oils the wheels of BIM implementation alongside with IPD in the OGPi firms to grabs BIM merits and harness its challenges. Finally, the major limitations and the required future studies are addressed.",Fakhimi A.; Majrouhi S.; Mazroi A.; Goreishi S.; Azhar S.,Journal,Civil Engineering Infrastructures Journal,2021-12-01,"Islamic Azad University, Central Tehran Branch;DNV GL AS;Auburn University",Adoption Roadmap ;  BIM ;  IDT ;  Integrated Project Delivery ;  OGP Industry
Review of Human Mobility Pattern Analysis Based on Big Transportation Data,"Big data in transportation provide a basis for revealing hidden mobility patterns in observable travel behaviors of moving objects. Understanding these patterns may provide theoretical foundations for practical applications, such as travel demand prediction, passenger flow organization, land use planning, or incident management. Despite these merits, several issues are encountered in these applications, as big data have high-dimensional entities, various spatiotemporal dynamics, and complex mobility connections. These issues include expressing the patterns in a consistent way, detecting multiple outliers among them, portraying their inner complex correlations, modeling their spatiotemporal polymorphism, or visualizing them in an integrated manner. To deal with these complex characteristics, previous methods adopted in the era of small data have to be upgraded. Thus, we reviewed 3 747 academic studies published between 2010 and 2020 and explored the distributions of co-occurring hot keywords, topic variations, and publication preferences using a knowledge-mapping tool. A systematic summary was given to describe the progress made in five mobility-pattern-based research directions, namely normality analysis, abnormality analysis, correlation analysis, prediction analysis, and visual analytics. In particular, in the field of normality analysis, the progress of activity pattern analysis, travel category segmentation, and special group analysis was first reviewed. Based on the normality analysis, two types of approaches in the field of abnormality analysis were further summarized, namely module-based and data-driven approaches. With the knowledge of the ways identifying normal or abnormal behaviors, correlation analysis was further reviewed to determine the developing trends of detecting mobility correlations based on different data sources. All of the above research results serve as solid bases for prediction analysis of mobility patterns, which was also reviewed in this paper. The review results show that two main types of approaches are used to fulfill the task: statistics-based and data-driven estimations. Finally, previous studies on visual analytics were reviewed to determine how transportation data can be visualized based on user interaction, macro exploration, micro exploration, and overall exploration. Overall, we identified several potential challenges in the aforementioned research directions, and proposed three promising development trends in data integration, model innovation, and scheme revolution. Our ultimate aim is to provide potential guidance for future studies involving mobility pattern analysis based on new theories and technologies.",Jiao P.; Zhao X.; Zhang Y.; Hu Y.; Yin B.,Journal,Zhongguo Gonglu Xuebao/China Journal of Highway and Transport,2021-12-01,Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture;Beijing University of Technology,Big data in transportation ;  Deep learning ;  Mobility pattern analysis ;  Review ;  Traffic engineering
Value Co-Creation in Engineering Service Innovation: Resources and Capabilities Perspectives,"Purpose: This research focuses on firm resources and capabilities used for value co-creation in service innovation. Specifically, I investigated how service innovation is created in an international engineering company. The aim of this article is to reveal what resources and capabilities are employed by a service provider for value co-creation in the innovation project of engineering service and how they vary in particular stages of this project. Methodology: The research is based on qualitative methodology by a multi-case study strategy. Focus group discussion with senior managers and semi-structured interviews with project managers of the studied international engineering company were used as concrete data gathering methods. Findings: The research revealed eight value co-creation activities accomplished by the engineering company and client during the engineering service innovation project. The activities are as follows: co-identification of the client's problem, co-evaluation of ideas, co-defining of client's requirements, co-analysis of environment, co-design, co-testing, and co-adoption, co-production, and co-activities after the launch. These activities are diffused in different project stages and demand a range of resources: expert knowledge, diagnostic, communication skills, trust, experience, technological equipment, human resources. Moreover, they require diverse capabilities: relational, innovative, analytical, negotiation, knowledge absorptive, planning, organizational flexibility, and cross-cultural. The intensity and variety of using the mentioned resources and capabilities differ relying on the value co-creation activity. We hope these findings will represent a step toward a more coherent resource-based view (RBV) and service innovation theories. Implications: The study involved only one Lithuanian engineering company, so the research context may influence the findings. Another limitation is related to the small number of cases and research participants. Originality: Unlike previous studies that revealed the importance of single resources and capabilities for service innovation, this study determined the range of resources and capabilities employed in different activities of engineering service innovation project stages, especially in the value co-creation activities performed by the engineering company and clients. Moreover, research also identified how resources and capabilities vary at different stages of these projects.",Gegužytė G.; Bagdonienė L.,Journal,Central European Management Journal,2021-12-01,Kaunas University of Technology,capabilities ;  engineering company ;  Lithuania ;  resources ;  service innovation ;  value co-creation

In Planta Cell Wall Engineering: From Mutants to Artificial Cell Walls,"To mitigate the effects of global warming and to preserve the limited fossil fuel resources, an increased exploitation of plant-based materials and fuels is required, which would be one of the most important innovations related to sustainable development. Cell walls account for the majority of plant dry biomass and so is the target of such innovations. In this review, we discuss recent advances in in planta cell wall engineering through genetic manipulations, with a focus on wild-type-based and mutant-based approaches. The long history of using a wild-type-based approach has resulted in the development of many strategies for manipulating lignin, hemicellulose and pectin to decrease cell wall recalcitrance. In addition to enzyme-encoding genes, many transcription factor genes important for changing relevant cell wall characteristics have been identified. Although mutant-based cell wall engineering is relatively new, it has become feasible due to the rapid development of genome-editing technologies and systems biology-related research; we will soon enter an age of designed artificial wood production via complex genetic manipulations of many industrially important trees and crops.",Yoshida K.; Sakamoto S.; Mitsuda N.,Journal,Plant and Cell Physiology,2021-12-01,National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology;Taisei Corporation,Cell wall ;  Cellulose ;  Genetic modification ;  Hemicellulose ;  Lignin ;  Wood
Critical thinking in the urban living habitat: Attributes criteria and typo-morphological exploration of modularity design,"The urban living habitat is one of the most important measures of socio-economic well-being in each country. Addressing the urban habitat's lifestyle change and pandemic pressure, the Asian cities, particularly, have found the abrupt transmutes altering local landscape and lifestyle. Cities filled with desires to modernize undertook actions that strained the local culture, perception, and ways of life. Urbanization ultimately mutated the local veins and people. The health crisis brought more changes and demanding a new thinking in provision of building for the built environment. The practice of modularity in architecture provides a fast-track solution to the demand imposed. However, the system must engage the local context, and efforts to interface people, place, and the process. This research aims to formulate the concept of design process based on modular design criteria that subverts the traditional engineering and design thinking and actively adapts to the local people and place to the process. A design consideration framework is combined to develop a preliminary understanding on probable variability and flexibility requirements. By taking the particularity of the place-based people (user), place (environment) and process (technology), the design evaluation could holistically integrate modularity in design. The degree of integration level within the systemic component units developed through “process” evaluation could adequately respond to the user and place need toward well-being state. Findings highlight how the prototype attains typo-morphological units while in keeping with development demand in urban areas. The adaptable common, unique, and variant components can be incorporated into a finite typology that may attain morphological flexibility. Aside from responding to emergency architecture, the modularity in design framework emphasizes the importance of innovations in modular thinking as a direct disruption of the customary building and design practice.",Ling T.; Yen N.; Lin C.; Chandra W.,Journal,Journal of Building Engineering,2021-12-01,National Chengchi University;Tamkang University;NHMRC (Singapore),Architecture modularity ;  Cohesive ;  People ;  Place and process ;  Typo-morphology assessment

"Fibronectin-enriched biomaterials, biofunctionalization, and proactivity: A review","Modern innovation in reconstructive medicine implies the proposition of material-based strategies suitable for tissue repair and regeneration. The development of such systems necessitates the design of advanced materials and the control of their interactions with their surrounding cellular and molecular microenvironments. Biomaterials must actively engage cellular matter to direct and modulate biological responses at implant sites and beyond. Indeed, it is essential that a true dialogue exists between the implanted device and the cells. Biomaterial engineering implies the knowledge and control of cell fate considering the globality of the adhesion process, from initial cell attachment to differentiation. The extracellular matrix (ECM) represents a complex microenvironment able to meet these essential needs to establish a relationship between the material and the contacting cells. The ECM exhibits specific physical, chemical, and biochemical characteristics. Considering the complexity, heterogeneity, and versatility of ECM actors, fibronectin (Fn) has emerged among the ECM protagonists as the most pertinent representative key actor. The following review focuses onand synthesizes the research supporting the potential to use Fn in biomaterial functionalization to mimic the ECM and enhance cell-material interactions.",Durand C.; Pauthe E.; Gand A.,Journal,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),2021-12-01,Equipe de Recherche sur les Relations Matrice Extracellulaire-Cellule,Biofunctionalized biomaterials ;  Extracellular matrix ;  Fibronectin ;  Hydrogels ;  Interfacial properties ;  Surface coatings
Human microphysiological models of airway and alveolar epithelia,"Human organ-on-a-chip models are powerful tools for preclinical research that can be used to study the mechanisms of disease and evaluate new targets for therapeutic intervention. Lung-on-a-chip models have been one of the most well-characterized designs in this field and can be altered to evaluate various types of respiratory disease and to assess treatment candidates prior to clinical testing. These systems are capable of overcoming the flaws of conventional two-dimensional (2-D) cell culture and in vivo animal testing due to their ability to accurately recapitulate the in vivo microenvironment of human tissue with tunable material properties, microfluidic integration, delivery of precise mechanical and biochemical cues, and designs with organ-specific architecture. In this review, we first describe an overview of currently available lung-on-a-chip designs. We then present how recent innovations in human stem cell biology, tissue engineering, and microfabrication can be used to create more predictive human lung-on-a-chip models for studying respiratory disease.

Factors driving BIM learning performance: research on china’s sixth national BIM graduation design innovation competition of colleges and universities,"With the popularization and rise in BIM technology usage, BIM education for undergraduate students in architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) related disciplines has emerged as a priority. This study assesses the BIM learning outcomes of students participating in the National BIM Graduation Design Innovation Competition of Colleges and Universities. In total, 2777 valid questionnaire responses were obtained for this study. The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient method and principal component factor analysis method were used to verify the reliability of the data set (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.962, KMO = 0.965). The t-test (ANOVA) was used to verify that gender, school type, major, grade, study duration and use BIM related software, as well as other demographic attributes, displayed significant inter-group differences. Seven common factors affecting BIM learning performance were obtained by exploratory factor analysis: (1) ability of the instructor, (2) school (college) atmosphere, (3) teamwork, (4) individual ability, (5) understanding of BIM industry applications, (6) social environment incentives, and (7) achievement demand. Finally, the results of an ordered logistic regression revealed that the demographic attributes of participants, the comprehensive ability of the instructor, teamwork, individual ability, and achievement demand significantly affects BIM learning performance.

Product quality planning in laser metal processing based on open innovation using quality function deployment,"The results of the development of a modified quality function deployment (QFD) method, obtained for the first time to improve the product quality planning process in the metal cutting of laser technologies confirming the dynamics of open innovation, are presented. When using new marketing technologies, the requirements of consumers are established; a factorial model of customer satisfaction was determined with after an assessment by expert methods, their wishes were transformed into indicators of product quality, and its concept was developed. Product quality is enhanced by optimizing project specifications. The method of functional cost analysis (FCA) was applied for the manufacturing processes, which made it possible to reduce the costs of their implementation. New methods of product quality control were applied. The developed planning process is described by a sequence diagram, an algorithm, and a responsibility matrix. The research used search methods including Internet resources required for open innovation, namely functional modeling methods (IDEF) and the method of advanced product quality planning (APQP). The results of the achieved advantages of open innovation (reduction in research and development costs, implementation of the principles of total quality management (TQM), customer orientation, process approach, improvement) are recommended for further application both at the enterprise and in the metalworking of mechanical engineering. The practical significance of the results of this work is the reduction in internal and external failures by 12%; reduction in time for new product development by 9%; reduction in costs for online resources by 11% and quality control during production by 7%; reduction in labor costs for process management by 25%; and the stability of the process, which improved by 25%.",Syreyshchikova N.; Pimenov D.; Yaroslavova E.; Gupta M.; Sharma S.; Giasin K.,Journal,"Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity",2021-12-01,University of Portsmouth;Punjab Technical University;Opole University of Technology;South Ural State University,Advanced product quality planning (APQP) ;  Consumer requirements ;  Functional cost analysis (FCA) ;  Functional modeling methods (IDEF) ;  House of quality ;  Open innovation ;  Quality function deployment (QFD) ;  Total quality management (TQM)
Intelligent generation method of innovative structures based on topology optimization and deep learning,"Computer-aided design has been widely used in structural calculation and analysis, but there are still challenges in generating innovative structures intelligently. Aiming at this issue, a new method was proposed to realize the intelligent generation of innovative structures based on topology optimization and deep learning. Firstly, a large number of structural models obtained from topology optimization under different optimization parameters were extracted to produce the training set images, and the training set labels were defined as the corresponding load cases. Then, the boundary equilibrium generative adversarial networks (BEGAN) deep learning algorithm was applied to generate numerous innovative structures. Finally, the generated structures were evaluated by a series of evaluation indexes, including innovation, aesthetics, machinability, and mechanical performance. Combined with two engineering cases, the application process of the above method is described here in detail. Furthermore, the 3D reconstruction and additive manufacturing techniques were applied to manufacture the structural models. The research results showed that the proposed approach of structural generation based on topology optimization and deep learning is feasible, and can not only generate innovative structures but also optimize the material consumption and mechanical performance further.",Wang Y.; Du W.; Wang H.; Zhao Y.,Journal,Materials,2021-12-01,Henan University;Henan Provincial Research Center of Engineering on Intelligent Construction of Rail Transit,Additive manufacturing ;  Boundary equilibrium generative adversarial networks ;  Innovative structures ;  Material consumption ;  Topology optimization
Antifouling with chloride ion electrolytic recycling through a momentum boundary layer,"SeaLite Engineering, after a 10-yr research and development program, has produced an operational antifouling system for ocean sensors and instruments designed for low power consumption and long (.1 yr) deployments. The important innovation is the replacement of pumps by gravity and external motion to significantly reduce energy con-sumption. Also, a prototype system for autonomous underwater vehicle control surfaces is now undergoing laboratory testing. The effectiveness of SeaLite’s technology has been demonstrated year-round in northern estuaries and in the Gulf of Mexico, the latter by an independent agency. The process leading to this result was, first starting in 2010, an extensive laboratory evaluation of electrode alloys, calibration of chlorine production versus electric power input, and the location for attaching electrodes to various objects requiring protection from fouling. After 2015 the experimentation moved to the ocean, first in a Cape Cod estuary and then to the Gulf of Mexico. Comparisons with a mechanical antifouling system were done in situ, and with a UV antifouling system from AML Oceanographic, Ltd., by comparing the data. Starting in 2019, the development of biofilms, from their initial deposition through the extra polysaccharide substance stage, were experimentally investigated by taking samples from an estuary near SeaLite’s laboratory. Biofilms on microscope slides and water column samples were collected. This was done in different seasons, from spring bloom, summer doldrums, autumn temperature decline, and the winter freeze. The objective was to determine the level of biofilm growth that would require antifouling, and its’ seasonal, temperature, and solar radiation de-pendence, and thus to conserve power.",Seaver G.; Butler D.,Journal,Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology,2021-12-01,Sherpa Engineering;SeaLite Engineering,Data quality control ;  In situ oceanic observations ;  Instrumentation/sensors
“In Our Own Little World”: Invisibility of the Social and Ethical Dimension of Engineering Among Undergraduate Students,"This paper explores how undergraduate students understood the social relevance of their engineering course content knowledge and drew (or failed to draw) broader social and ethical implications from that knowledge. Based on a three-year qualitative study in a junior-level engineering class, we found that students had difficulty in acknowledging the social and ethical aspects of engineering as relevant topics in their coursework. Many students considered the immediate technical usability or improved efficiency of technical innovations as the noteworthy social and ethical implications of engineering. Findings suggest that highly-structured engineering programs leave little room for undergraduate students to explore the ethical dimension of engineering content knowledge and interact with other students/programs on campus to expand their “technically-minded” perspective. We discussed the issues of the “culture of disengagement” (Cech, Sci Technol Human Values 39(1):42–72, 2014) fueled by disciplinary elitism, spatial distance, and insulated curriculum prevalent in the current structure of engineering programs. We called for more conscious effort by engineering educators to offer meaningful interdisciplinary engagement opportunities and in-class conversations on ethics that support engineering students' holistic intellectual growth and well-rounded professional ethics.",Lim J.; Hunt B.; Findlater N.; Tkacik P.; Dahlberg J.,Journal,Science and Engineering Ethics,2021-12-01,William States Lee College of Engineering;The University of North Carolina at Charlotte,Engineering ethics ;  Qualitative research ;  Undergraduate students
Current trends in the development and use of personalized implants: Engineering concepts and regulation perspectives for the contemporary oral and maxillofacial surgeon,"The recently adopted Medical Device Regulation (MDR) has finally entered into force on 26 May 2021. As innovation and especially the advent of customized prostheses has deeply modified many surgical procedures in our discipline, it is imperative for the contemporary surgeon to become aware of the impact that the MDR will have on many aspects, including the choice of the manufacturer, the evaluation of the devices, point-of-care 3D printing labs, and medical software. In this paper, the authors tried to identify the cultural gaps in clinical practice that the MDR is supposed to fill. To achieve this purpose, a task force of experts was reunited, including CMF surgeons with direct expertise in medical software and 3D printing, mechanical and material engineers, facing the topic of the MDR from a multidimensional perspective. In this article, surgeons and engineers review many crucial aspects concerning the points of the regulation that mostly affect the field of implantable devices for the cranio-maxillo-facial skeleton. The result of interdisciplinary research is a paper aiming to provide surgeons with the knowledge on the fundamental processes of additive manufacturing, increasing the clinician’s awareness on the evaluation of a customized implant before surgery and on the underlying regulatory framework.",Tel A.; Bordon A.; Sortino M.; Totis G.; Fedrizzi L.; Ocello E.; Sembronio S.; Robiony M.,Journal,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),2021-12-01,Università degli Studi di Udine,Hospital ;  Maintenance and engineering ;  Maxillofacial prosthesis implantation ;  Maxillofacial surgery ;  Mechanical phenomena ;  Printing ;  Three-dimensional

Materials as activator of future global science and technology challenges,"The aim of this statement is to give a contribution towards the future, where for all, materials are the driven force for the transformations we aim to reach and for which a global common house is imperative to be established, as the International Union of Materials Research Societies, IUMRS aims to be the central vehicle for such, aiming to boost innovation to its maxima, without compromising vital global principles of opening science to the world. This is consolidated by 4 main principles: Circular Economy; Trans disciplinarity; Horizontal cross cutting synergy (the introduced Metro Station concept); look always to the Big Picture and not to silos. This means that the traditional vertical thematic topics that were essential to define so far, the so-called road maps for something should be revisited and reconverted towards much larger horizontal scenarios.",Martins R.,Journal,Progress in Natural Science: Materials International,2021-12-01,Full Professor at FCT-NOVA;European Academy of Sciences,Green technologies and products ;  Materials accelerator of progress changes ;  Materials activator ;  Materials science and engineering
Online vs. on-campus higher education: Exploring innovation in students' self-reports and students' learning products,"Innovation is an essential competency in the 21st century workplace, and hence, a required skill for higher education students. Studies on innovation in higher education examined the way students perceive themselves as innovators, while others examined the level of innovation in learning products. Research has yet to address the association between innovation as expressed in students' self-reports and in students' learning products. Moreover, since due to the COVID-19 outbreak, many faculties rely primarily on online platforms to deliver courses, there is a growing need to identify students’ innovation in online learning environments. This study aimed to examine higher education students' innovation as expressed in their self-reports and in their learning products, while comparing two formats of the same engineering course: an on-campus synchronous face-to-face (F2F) course, and a fully online asynchronous course. The participants were divided into two groups: F2F students (n = 103), and online students (n = 108). Applying the quasi-experimental design, data were collected via a pre- and post-questionnaire, and students' mean scores on the innovation level of their learning products. Findings indicated that both F2F and online students self-reported similar levels of innovative behavioral tendencies. Yet, the F2F students received higher mean scores on innovation, compared with the online students, in both individual assignments and team projects. We conclude by suggesting guidelines to better promote students’ innovation in higher education courses delivered online.",Usher M.; Barak M.; Haick H.,Journal,Thinking Skills and Creativity,2021-12-01,Technion - Israel Institute of Technology,Higher education ;  Innovation outcomes ;  Innovative thinking ;  Online asynchronous education
Review of chemical stabilizing agents for improving the physical and mechanical properties of loess,"Due to the special soil-forming environment and process, grain-size distribution, and mineral composition, loess has some poor engineering properties, such as high compressibility, strong water sensitivity, and severe collapsibility. These poor properties lead to frequent occurrence of geological disasters and engineering problems in loess area, so loess is often strengthened in engineering projects. Compared with the traditional methods, the use of stabilizing agents has the advantages of saving time, reducing cost, and increasing efficiency. Therefore, more and more attention has been paid to the research on soil stabilizing agents. In this review, the non-traditional stabilizing agents which can effectively improve the physical and mechanical properties of loess are summarized, including nanomaterials, industrial waste residues, water-hardening inorganic materials, polymer, ion stabilizing agents, and so on. The composition, mechanism, effect, and application of each stabilizing agent are introduced. The mechanisms of strengthening mainly include filling, cementation, ion exchange, and wrapping. One or several of these mechanisms work together when loess is strengthened with any stabilizing agent. Based on this review, it is recognized that it is still meaningful to find eco-friendly and cost-effective loess stabilizing agents, and the focuses are now still on interpretation of the mechanism of each stabilizing agent, as well as determination of the physical and mechanical properties of strengthened loess. Attention should be paid to the degradation in the mechanical properties of strengthened loess and the technical innovation in application, as well as to solving the problems related to practical application of these stabilizing agents.",Hou Y.; Li P.; Wang J.,Journal,Bulletin of Engineering Geology and the Environment,2021-12-01,Xi'an University of Technology;Northwest University,Effect of strengthening ;  Loess stabilizing agents ;  Loess strengthening ;  Mechanism of strengthening
Nascent technology entrepreneurship among bulgarian stem students,"Technology entrepreneurship may contribute significantly to economic development and innovation. Little research has investigated the role of the university in technology entrepreneurship among STEM (science, technology, engineering or mathematics) students. More research into the entrepreneurial intentions–behaviour link is needed. This paper aims to identify university-related factors that may contribute to the translation of technopreneurial implementation intentions into ac-tions in a sample of 200 STEM students. The variables university research excellence and perceptions of business development support significantly influence the likelihood of nascent technopreneurial behaviour. This study contributes to a greater understanding of the technopreneurial process and the drivers of technopreneurial behaviour among STEM students. The results of this study may help to enhance nascent entrepreneurship among Bulgarian STEM students.",Yordanova D.,Journal,Administrative Sciences,2021-12-01,Sofia University St. Kliment Ohridski,Nascent technology entrepreneurship ;  STEM students ;  Student entrepreneurship ;  University
"Women’s career confidence in a fixed, sexist STEM environment","Background: Innovation in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields in the U.S. is threatened by a lack of diversity. Social identity threat research finds messages in the academic environment devalue women and underrepresented groups in STEM, creating a chilly and hostile environment. Research has focused on the mechanisms that contribute to STEM engagement and interest at the K-12 and undergraduate level, but the mechanisms that predict sustained engagement at the graduate level have not been studied. Results: In a longitudinal study of doctoral students in STEM disciplines, we demonstrate that students’ beliefs that their STEM colleagues believe intelligence is a fixed (vs. malleable) trait undermine women’s engagement in STEM. Specifically, perceiving a fixed ability environment predicts greater perceptions of sexism, which erode women’s self-efficacy and sense of belongingness and lead women to consider dropping out of their STEM career. Conclusion: These findings identify one potential pathway by which women leave their STEM fields, perpetuating gender disparities in STEM.",Clark S.; Dyar C.; Inman E.; Maung N.; London B.,Journal,International Journal of STEM Education,2021-12-01,Stony Brook University;Northwestern University,Gender ;  Identity compatibility ;  Self-efficacy ;  Sense of belonging ;  STEM ;  STEM persistence
Performance analysis of highly efficient 2D/3D bilayer inverted perovskite solar cells,"Photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) acquired in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is currently competitive with that of other commercial solar cells. Despite profound progress in PSCs in the last few years, achieving long term stability is considered as a prime hindrance for the commercialization of these solar cells. Recently, low dimensional perovskites have drawn extensive interests in research to improve photo-stability, however, wide bandgap limits output power of low dimensional perovskite-based solar cells. Two-dimensional/three-dimensional (2D/3D) bilayer PSCs can overcome this barrier via innovation in device engineering that can retain high performance and long-term photostability simultaneously. For example, inverted p-i-n structure of 2D/3D bilayer PSCs has drawn enormous interests in recent years due to cost-effectiveness, low temperature processing, and inhibited hysteresis characteristics. In this report, we present a numerical modeling approach to optimize the performance of an inverted 2D/3D bilayer PSC with a novel device architecture: ITO/NiOx/BA2MAn-1PbnI3n+1/MAPbI3/ZnO/Al. Perovskite materials with thickness of ∼900 nm (BA2MAn-1PbnI3n+1(200 nm)/MAPbI3 (700 nm)) and defect density of 2 × 1014 cm−3 yields best cell efficiency, that is up to ∼24.75%. Further optimization of electron transport layer and hole transport layer along with their donor and acceptor density level leads to 2.56% increase in the efficiency, that is from ∼23.53% to ∼24.75%. Our estimation suggests that incorporating 2D BA2MAn-1PbnI3n+1 perovskite into 3D MAPbI3 perovskite yield high throughput and simultaneously minimize the fabrication cost for active absorber layer in inverted PSCs.",Chakrabartty J.; Islam M.; Reza S.,Journal,Solar Energy,2021-12-01,Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology,ETL ;  HTL ;  Inverted PSC structure ;  Perovskite solar cells ;  Photostability ;  Photovoltaic conversion efficiency
"Numerical investigation to assess the techno-economic feasibility of solar central receiver system for off-grid power in Saint Martin's Island, Bangladesh","Bangladesh is a small country, located in south-east Asia having a fast-progressing economy and exemplary development in industry, architecture and engineering sectors. With such developments, demand of power is also on the rise exponentially. Although the generation capacity of the country has seen a major boost, lack of proper distribution, negligence towards renewable energy resources and dependance on perishable fossil fuels (natural gas, coal, mineral oil etc.) pose a major risk of a significant power crisis in future. The only tourist favorite island of the country, known as Saint Martin's Island lacks national grid connection and stable source of power to mitigate the inhabitants' electricity need. This study intends to analyze the technical and economic feasibility of solar powered central receiver system to provide steady and cheap means of power generation at the island in an environment friendly manner. A detailed and optimized model has been designed for simulating a 1 MW solar powered central receiver plant using SolarPILOT and System Advisor Model (SAM) software. Modelled power plant can generate 3304 MWh electricity yearly with a gross efficiency and capacity factor 12.29% and 41.9% respectively at 38.61 Cents/kWh levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) which is much cheaper than the current rate at Saint Martin's Island. The promising performance of the powerplant designed in this study would encourage future research and innovations in case of off-grid electricity generation employing solar thermal energy in Bangladesh to ensure sustainable development.",Hossain M.; Shajid S.; Karim M.,Journal,Energy for Sustainable Development,2021-12-01,Islamic University of Technology,Central Receiver ;  Modelling ;  Optimization ;  Solar Energy ;  Techno-Economic Assessment
"Environmental regulation, economic policy uncertainty, and green technology innovation","Green technology innovation is imperative to sustainable and environmentally sound economic development and is currently facing increasingly serious environmental threats. However, existing research has overlooked the uncertainties in economic policies. Based on the logical relationship between environmental regulation, economic policy uncertainty, and green technology innovation, this study empirically analyzed the quantitative relationship among these three variables using the fixed-effect panel method and provincial panel data from 2000 to 2017 for 30 administrative regions of China. The results show that environmental regulation is positively correlated with green innovation, whereas economic policy uncertainty has a negative influence on green innovation, thereby regulating the relationship between the remaining two factors. Moreover, considerable regional heterogeneity exists in these causal influences, i.e., environmental regulation promotes green innovation in the eastern and middle regions but not significantly in the west. The uncertainty actively moderates the impact of environmental regulation on green innovation in all regions with an adjustment coefficient of approximately 0.8; however, it inhibits green innovation in different degrees, especially in the eastern and middle regions. Based on empirical results, we conclude that strict and appropriate environmental regulations are necessary and effective in China to encourage green technology innovation, especially in regions with uncertain economic policies.

Software Training in HEP,"The long-term sustainability of the high-energy physics (HEP) research software ecosystem is essential to the field. With new facilities and upgrades coming online throughout the 2020s, this will only become increasingly important. Meeting the sustainability challenge requires a workforce with a combination of HEP domain knowledge and advanced software skills. The required software skills fall into three broad groups. The first is fundamental and generic software engineering (e.g., Unix, version control, C++, and continuous integration). The second is knowledge of domain-specific HEP packages and practices (e.g., the ROOT data format and analysis framework). The third is more advanced knowledge involving specialized techniques, including parallel programming, machine learning and data science tools, and techniques to maintain software projects at all scales. This paper discusses the collective software training program in HEP led by the HEP Software Foundation (HSF) and the Institute for Research and Innovation in Software in HEP (IRIS-HEP). The program equips participants with an array of software skills that serve as ingredients for the solution of HEP computing challenges. Beyond serving the community by ensuring that members are able to pursue research goals, the program serves individuals by providing intellectual capital and transferable skills important to careers in the realm of software and computing, inside or outside HEP.",Malik S.; Meehan S.; Lieret K.; Oan Evans M.; Villanueva M.; Katz D.; Stewart G.; Elmer P.; Aziz S.; Bellis M.; Bianchi R.; Bianco G.; Bonilla J.; Burger A.; Burzynski J.; Chamont D.; Feickert M.; Gadow P.; Gruber B.; Guest D.; Hageboeck S.; Heinrich L.; Horzela M.; Huwiler M.; Lange C.; Lehmann K.; Li K.; Majumder D.; Mamužić J.; Nelson K.; Newhouse R.; Nibigira E.; Norberg S.; Pineda A.; Proffitt M.; Regnery B.; Roepe A.; Roiser S.; Schreiner H.; Shadura O.; Stark G.; Swatman S.; Thais S.; Valassi A.; Wunsch S.; Yakobovitch D.; Yuan S.,Journal,Computing and Software for Big Science,2021-12-01,"Université Paris-Saclay;Université de Strasbourg;Karlsruher Institut für Technologie;Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics;Recinto Universitario de Mayagüez;The University of Oklahoma;Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY);Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München;Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna;University of Nebraska–Lincoln;University of Michigan, Ann Arbor;Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare - INFN;Organisation Européenne pour la Recherche Nucléaire;Boston University;Université Savoie Mont Blanc;Simon Fraser University;Technische Universität Dresden;University of Sussex;University of Pittsburgh;University of Washington;University of California, Davis;University of Massachusetts Amherst;Universität Zürich;University of Mississippi;The University of British Columbia;Oklahoma State University;Siena College;Princeton University;Universitat de València;Universiteit van Amsterdam;Institut Ruđer Bošković;Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin;University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign;SingleStore;Center for Advanced Systems Understanding (CASUS)",HEP ;  Software ;  Training
"The promising use of nano-molecular imprinted templates for improved SARS-CoV-2 detection, drug delivery and research","Molecular imprinting (MI) is a technique that creates a template of a molecule for improving complementary binding sites in terms of size and shape to a peptide, protein, bacteria, mammalian cell, or virus on soft materials (such as polymers, hydrogels, or self-assembled materials). MI has been widely investigated for over 90 years in various industries but is now focused on improved tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, drug delivery, sensors, diagnostics, therapeutics and other medical applications. Molecular targets that have been studied so far in MI include those for the major antigenic determinants of microorganisms (like bacteria or viruses) leading to innovations in disease diagnosis via solid-phase extraction separation and biomimetic sensors. As such, although not widely investigated yet, MI demonstrates much promise for improving the detection of and treatment for the current Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-2019) pandemic as well as future pandemics. In this manner, this review will introduce the numerous applications of MI polymers, particularly using proteins and peptides, and how these MI polymers can be used as improved diagnostic and therapeutic tools for COVID-19.

The role of IT in organizational innovation – A systematic literature review,"Information technology (IT) is broadly recognized as an important element in organizational innovation, however there has been relatively little integration of Information Systems (IS) research on the role of IT in organizational innovation. Such integration is particularly important in view of recent calls to examine the evolving ontological nature of IT, wherein IT artifacts are now shaping physical reality. We systematically examine innovation-related literature published in the leading IS journals in the period between 2009 and 2020 and we identify and summarize the core theoretical discourses in this domain. We find that extant literature largely examines the role of IT in innovation at a high level of abstraction, focusing on IT investments and IT capabilities, and consequently precluding granular insights on who, what, when, where, how, and why in relation to organizational innovation. To address this limitation and to provide a structuring lens for future research, we develop the organizational innovation system framework which posits that actors, IT artifacts, actions and organizational context are the key elements in organizational innovation systems that require more granular examination to yield deeper insights on how information technology contributes to organizational innovation. We re-examine the literature through the organizational innovation system lens and we identify gaps in extant research. We also outline potential directions for expanding the scope of future research.",Mamonov S.; Peterson R.,Journal,Journal of Strategic Information Systems,2021-12-01,Montclair State University,Information technology ;  Innovation ;  Innovation systems ;  Organizational innovation ;  Systematic review ;  Technology innovation management
"Tissue engineering, 3D-Bioprinting, morphogenesis modelling and simulation of biostructures: Relevance, underpinning biological principles and future trends","Tissue engineering has enabled the creation of strategies and solutions in the biomedical area, which have widely benefited patients suffering from different conditions. In recent years, new technologies and advances in related fields have increased the effectiveness of the treatments developed in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine and have marked a milestone in the history of medicine. New discoveries have provided a wider understanding of the biology of tissues and organs, hand in hand with the fourth industrial revolution, particularly, the disruptive technologies for manufacturing, a new possibility may be within reach in the next years: to fabricate organs that are functionally equivalent to physiological ones. This article presents a general revision of the role of tissue engineering and the implementation of additive manufacturing technology. The analysis is under the light of a simple molecular biology interpretation of the key aspects, main successes, and major challenges. This revision summarizes how the biology of tissues can be reinterpreted in an engineering framework as the differential adhesion hypothesis (DAH), which allows modelling a wide range of fundamental interactions among cells. Some models for tissue morphogenesis based on contact interaction and signaling agents are presented and analyzed in the context of the current state of the art of 3D-bioprinting technology.

Does Technological Innovation Compete or Complement Job Employment? Effect of Technological Innovation and Financial Performance,"The study aimed to investigate whether software-based or engineering-based innovation from in-house, outsourced or multinational corporations is in competition or a complement to job employment. Using the Indian stock market as a testing ground, we used canonical correlation analysis and panel regression to analyse 80 sustainability-reporting firms. The study shows that technological innovation in engineering and software complements employment in the extractive and manufacturing industries. However, the study shows that technological innovation in engineering and software competes with employment in the service industries. The research also indicates that technological innovation (software-based and engineering-based) alone does not significantly affect job employment. However, an increased technological innovation in engineering combined with financial performance leads to a corresponding rise in the employment of manufacturing industries.",Oware K.; Mallikarjunappa T.,Journal,Indian Journal of Labour Economics,2021-12-01,Central University of Kerala;Mangalore University,Financial performance ;  Formalisation of the economy ;  Industrial sector firms ;  Job employment ;  Resource dependency theory ;  Technological innovation
Advances in engineering microbial biosynthesis of aromatic compounds and related compounds,"Aromatic compounds have broad applications and have been the target of biosynthetic processes for several decades. New biomolecular engineering strategies have been applied to improve production of aromatic compounds in recent years, some of which are expected to set the stage for the next wave of innovations. Here, we will briefly complement existing reviews on microbial production of aromatic compounds by focusing on a few recent trends where considerable work has been performed in the last 5 years. The trends we highlight are pathway modularization and compartmentalization, microbial co-culturing, non-traditional host engineering, aromatic polymer feedstock utilization, engineered ring cleavage, aldehyde stabilization, and biosynthesis of non-standard amino acids.

Research on the practice of the new education mode reform based on the teaching of architectural design course and the thinking of future architectural education,"Since entering the new millennium, people have put forward higher requirements for the practicability and appreciation of architecture. This means that the traditional architecture is bound to usher in the tide of all-round reform. In order to adapt to the changes of the times, architectural design education must actively adjust, change the malpractice of only focusing on internal audit and relatively ignoring the external demand, and take meeting the market demand as the key goal of cultivating students. The author has been involved in architectural design education for many years and has a clear understanding of the current situation of the major. At the same time, he has long been concerned about the changes in the market demand of the major.

The impact of innovation on economic growth among G7 and BRICS countries: A GMM style panel vector autoregressive approach,"The study aims to investigate the impact of innovation on economic growth among the G7 and BRICS countries. Our data was retrieved from the World Development Indicators database (World Bank 2019) from the period 2000-2017. Innovation is measured by R&D, patents, and trademarks. This research explored how GDP per capita reacts to a shock from R&D, patent, and trademark among G7 and BRICS countries. Stationarity tests are conducted through panel unit-roots tests. The authors employed a GMM style panel VAR estimator to investigate the phenomenon. Our results revealed that R&D, patent, and trademark as the determinants of innovation have a significant impact on GDP per capita also as a determinant of economic growth among G7 and BRICS countries. However, the impact is more among the G7 than the BRICS countries. The impulse response function of the panel VAR estimates shows that the impact of one standard deviation shock in R&D, patent, and trademark on GDP per capita varies from year one to year ten among these variables for both G7 and BRICS countries.",Gyedu S.; Heng T.; Ntarmah A.; He Y.; Frimppong E.,Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2021-12-01,Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration (GIMPA);Jiangsu University,BRICS ;  Economic growth ;  G7 ;  GMM style panel VAR ;  Innovation

The role of external technology scouting in inbound open innovation generation: Evidence from high-technology industries,"An external technology scouting is a commonly used open search method used by the firms to facilitate innovation. Drawing on a knowledge-based perspective and evolutionary theory on open innovation, this article proposes that the firms generate more innovations and capture better external technology if they possess well-developed absorptive capacity, that provides access to the innovative developments in an uncertain technological environment. We introduce our external technology scouting model of innovation outputs to explain how technology scouting and absorptive capacity predict firms' inbound open innovation generation in a turbulent environment. Using a sample of 236 high-technology firms, we examine main, two-way, and three-way interaction effects for measures of inbound open innovation generation. The results indicate both main and moderating effects for both measures of performance, which are critical for innovation generations. A significant three-way interaction shows the joint effect of the technology turbulence, absorptive capacity, and external technology scouting on inbound open innovation generation. Our findings have notable managerial and research implications.",Wang C.; Quan X.,Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2021-12-01,National Chiayi University;San Jose State University,Absorptive capacity ;  inbound open innovation generation ;  open innovation ;  technology scouting ;  technology uncertainty
Democratizing ownership and participation in the 4th Industrial Revolution: challenges and opportunities in cellular agriculture,"The emergence of the “4th Industrial Revolution,” i.e. the convergence of artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, advanced materials, and bioengineering technologies, could accelerate socioeconomic insecurities and anxieties or provide beneficial alternatives to the status quo. In the post-Covid-19 era, the entities that are best positioned to capitalize on these innovations are large firms, which use digital platforms and big data to orchestrate vast ecosystems of users and extract market share across industry sectors. Nonetheless, these technologies also have the potential to democratize ownership, broaden political-economic participation, and reduce environmental harms. We articulate the potential sociotechnical pathways in this high-stakes crossroads by analyzing cellular agriculture, an exemplary 4th Industrial Revolution technology that synergizes computer science, biopharma, tissue engineering, and food science to grow cultured meat, dairy, and egg products from cultured cells and/or genetically modified yeast. Our exploration of this space involved multi-sited ethnographic research in both (a) the cellular agriculture community and (b) alternative economic organizations devoted to open source licensing, member-owned cooperatives, social financing, and platform business models. Upon discussing how these latter approaches could potentially facilitate alternative sociotechnical pathways in cellular agriculture, we reflect upon the broader implications of this work with respect to the 4th Industrial Revolution and the enduring need for public policy reform.",Chiles R.; Broad G.; Gagnon M.; Negowetti N.; Glenna L.; Griffin M.; Tami-Barrera L.; Baker S.; Beck K.,Journal,Agriculture and Human Values,2021-12-01,Harvard Law School;Fordham University;Pennsylvania State University,"Cellular agriculture ;  Digital agriculture ;  Food and agricultural ethics ;  Political economy of agriculture ;  Rural sociology ;  Science, technology, and society ;  Social inequality"
Application of the OIRE method—tool support and initial feedback from two chinese companies,"To (semi-)automatically classify user needs that are collected from online open sources, we propose the Open Innovation in Requirements Engineering (OIRE) method. OIRE is mimicking the well-known Kano model exclusively using data from online reviews instead of conducting interviews with select focus groups. In our previous research, we introduced the design, implementation and preliminary validation of the applicability of the OIRE method. In this article, we introduce the tool support for the OIRE method, OIRE-System (OIRE-S), and evaluate the usefulness of the OIRE method using OIRE-S in an industry setting. For that purpose, we conducted one case study with two Chinese companies that plan to have software apps developed by suppliers. In addition, we conducted interviews about the case study with two addition stakeholders. Based on the analysis results of the case study and the interview study, we conclude that the OIRE method provides helpful information for stakeholders and, thus, is useful to decision-makers in industry, in particular as a complement to existing requirements elicitation and analysis activities.",Yin H.; Pfahl D.,Journal,Software Quality Journal,2021-12-01,Tartu Ülikool,Kano model ;  Kano-like model ;  OIRE ;  OIRE-S

Advances of endovascular stent and its treatment for aneurysms,"BACKGROUND: With the increasing incidence of vascular diseases, the clinical application of vascular stents combined with minimally invasive treatment surgery is widely used. OBJECTIVE: To describe the research background, performance requirements, types, raw materials, production and modification techniques of endovascular stents, and analyze the complications and improvement methods after the endovascular stent implanted in the human body. METHODS: The databases of CNKI and Web of Science were searched, and the search time period was from 2005 to 2020. The key words were “vascular stent, aneurysm, endovascular exclusion, research status” in English and Chinese. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The use of endovascular stents combined with minimally invasive treatment for aneurysms is very important in clinic. Traditional vascular stents cannot have good long-term patency rate, durability, anti-thrombosis and anti-tumor functions at the same time; it should be systematically designed and improved from the aspects of structural design, endothelialization, and functional modification of high effective drug release. The study of endovascular stents is a cutting-edge research involving multidisciplinary interdisciplinary research. To develop vascular stents with more biocompatible, more stable, and lower costs, the collaborative innovation of a multidisciplinary team of talents in biological materials, engineering technology and clinical medicine is important, so as to contribute to the medical cause of human beings.",Li F.; Wu K.; Zhao J.; Li G.,Journal,Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research,2021-12-01,The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University;Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital;Soochow University,Aneurysms ;  Anti-thrombosis ;  Endothelialization ;  Materials ;  Research status ;  Review ;  Stents ;  Vascular stents

Forging a new alliance between economics and engineering,"Economists and engineers have played a vital role in addressing the challenges posed by economic and technological progress. Related disciplines have intertwined with each other, leading to mutual cross-fertilization. However, their roles and relationships need to be reconsidered in a society increasingly influenced by the cluster of organizational and market innovations induced by artificial intelligence technologies. Looking at the history of the intriguing relationships between the two disciplines, in this paper three paradigms for the economics–engineering nexus are identified—economics “for/and/as” engineering—and their dimensions are discussed. This investigation enables to infer possible disciplinary scenarios in relation to the contemporary and future society. The paper calls for a new “alliance à la Prigogine” between economics and engineering driven by a transdisciplinary-oriented change in the epistemology and methods of the two disciplines and in their way of being and interacting. The mission of the alliance is to restore a unified perspective of knowledge and putting the study of complexity in the foreground. The conclusions emphasize that implementing the alliance implies large investments in human capital, as well as new bridges among universities and between these and other institutions to develop research programs open to variety, creativity, and participation of cooperative networks of scholars and practitioners.",Mariotti S.,Journal,Journal of Industrial and Business Economics,2021-12-01,Politecnico di Milano,Artificial intelligence ;  Complexity ;  Economics–engineering nexus ;  Epistemology ;  Transdisciplinarity

NGSS-based teacher professional development to implement engineering practices in STEM instruction,"Background: With widespread adoption of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) in the USA (US), research is needed on how secondary science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teachers conceptualize the integration of engineering knowledge and practices in traditional STEM classrooms. The present study explored the affective impacts of participation in an engineering education workshop for secondary STEM teachers as part of a 200-h professional development program. The workshop focused on the implementation of electrical engineering and biotechnology principles and design practices in disciplinary instruction, as well as training teachers to differentiate among engineering fields and advise on career pathways. The conceptual framework for the workshop design was based upon elements of the interconnected model of professional growth to identify influences contributing to engineering pedagogical self-efficacy and career awareness. Results: The overarching research questions addressed how professional development in engineering education affected secondary STEM teachers’ beliefs about the value of using engineering design to support learning, their self-efficacy regarding teaching engineering in their courses, perceived obstacles to effective STEM integration, and their confidence advising students about engineering post-secondary study and careers. The convergent parallel mixed methods design involved factor analysis, comparisons of means, and phenomenology with elements of grounded theory. The survey sample included 60 STEM teachers in the treatment group and 28 teachers in the control group. Six science teachers participated in interviews before and after the engineering workshops. Findings indicated that participating teachers significantly improved their confidence in engineering pedagogy, as well as their knowledge of engineering careers and precollege preparation for post-secondary engineering. Teachers expressed their views of engineering as a potentially powerful tool in developing students’ critical thinking and problem-solving skills, particularly when integrating the practices of science and engineering with the instruction of disciplinary content. Conclusions: The results from this study demonstrate that a university-based professional development workshop series, developed by engineering and science education faculty, is an effective first-step intervention to improve the engineering knowledge and skills of secondary STEM educators, ultimately facilitating NGSS adoption in classroom instruction. Educating teachers on engineering career pathways is another innovation for the promotion of more diverse participation in engineering fields.",Christian K.; Kelly A.; Bugallo M.,Journal,International Journal of STEM Education,2021-12-01,College of Engineering and Applied Sciences;Stony Brook University;Smithtown High School West,Engineering education ;  K-12 education ;  Mixed methods research ;  Precollege STEM preparation ;  Professional development ;  STEM integration
Concept and development of an interactive tool for trial recruitment planning and management,"Background: Predicting and monitoring recruitment in large, complex trials is essential to ensure appropriate resource management and budgeting. In a novel partnership between clinical trial investigators of the South African Medical Research Council and industrial engineers from the Stellenbosch University Health Systems Engineering and Innovation Hub, we developed a trial recruitment tool (TRT). The objective of the tool is to serve as a computerised decisions-support system to aid the planning and management phases of the trial recruitment process. Method: The specific requirements of the TRT were determined in several workshops between the partners. A Poisson process simulation model was formulated and incorporated in the TRT to predict the recruitment duration. The assumptions underlying the model were made in consultation with the trial team at the start of the project and were deemed reasonable. Real-world data extracted from a current cluster trial, Project MIND, based in 24 sites in South Africa was used to verify the simulation model and to develop the monitoring component of the TRT. Results: The TRT comprises a planning and monitoring component. The planning component generates different trial scenarios for predicted trial recruitment duration based on user inputs, e.g. number of sites, initiation delays. The monitoring component uses and analyses the data retrieved from the trial management information system to generate different levels of information, displayed visually on an interactive, user-friendly dashboard. Users can analyse the results at trial or site level, changing input parameters to see the resultant effect on the duration of trial recruitment. Conclusion: This TRT is an easy-to-use tool that assists in the management of the trial recruitment process. The TRT has potential to expedite improved management of clinical trials by providing the appropriate information needed for the planning and monitoring of the trial recruitment phase. This TRT extends prior tools describing historic recruitment only to using historic data to predict future recruitment. The broader project demonstrates the value of collaboration between clinicians and engineers to optimise their respective skillsets.",Spies R.; Siegfried N.; Myers B.; Grobbelaar S.,Journal,Trials,2021-12-01,South African Medical Research Council;Stellenbosch University,
Piezoelectric micropumps: state of the art review,"The purpose of this paper is to present an overview of problems and some research gaps for better understanding of piezoelectric micropump studies. Micropumps have important and diverse application areas in health and engineering applications. In recent years, researchers have carried out simulations, analytical and experimental studies to develop these technologies with different methods for the same purpose. It has been determined that piezoelectric micropumps as MEMS devices have an effective deep interest. It is worth mentioning that piezoelectric material has been considered by researchers as an attractive actuator due to its high-performance, potential cost and design convenience. This paper comprehensively reviews the studies that bring innovations in the literature of piezoelectric micropumps. Analytical characterization and modeling procedures studied by various scientists in the field of the piezoelectric actuators are also presented in detail. The analytical section will mainly focus on the studies related to the static and dynamic behaviours of circular piezoelectric actuators. Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of the various components used to fabricate micropumps have been investigated according to the available information in the literature. Consequently, this review enables researchers a useful reference on piezoelectric micropump parameters such as modeling, flow rate, shape control, geometry, and size optimization for key engineering applications.",Asadi Dereshgi H.; Dal H.; Yildiz M.,Journal,Microsystem Technologies,2021-12-01,Sakarya University of Applied Sciences;İstanbul Arel Üniversitesi;Sakarya Üniversitesi,
Synthesis of vinyl ester resin-carrying PVDF green nanofibers for self-healing applications,"Self-healing on the engineering applications is smart, decisive research for prolonging the life span of the materials and the innovations have been mounting still smarter. Connecting to advancements in self-healing carriers, in altering the chemical structure by optimizing the brittleness for self-healing performance and introducing the bio-degradability, for the first time TPS was blended to PVDF for the synthesis of nanofibers, as carriers of a vinyl ester (VE) resin (medication), by the coaxial electrospinning technique. TPS was mechanically mixed with PVDF base polymer and optimized the TPS content (10 wt%) based on mechanical performance. The novel nanofibers were characterized via field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermal, moisture analysis, and a mechanical line with FESEM and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis studied the self-healing. The TPS/PVDF fibers having hydrogen bonding and increased the crystallinity (40.57 → 44.12%) and the diameter (115 → 184 nm) along with the surface roughness of the fibers with increasing the TPS content. Microanalysis presented the flow-out of the VE resin at the scratched parts in the pierced fibers; interestingly, after some time, the etched part was cured automatically by the curing of the spread resin. Mechanical stretching of the nanofibers in the tensile tests up in the plastic region showed a decrement in the elasticity (TPS/PVDF fibers) and an increment in the brittle nature (cured VE resin) with the increase in Young’s modulus at each stretching, clearly elucidating the healing performance.",Naga Kumar C.; Prabhakar M.; Song J.,Journal,Scientific Reports,2021-12-01,Changwon National University,
More than STEM: spillovers from higher education institution infrastructure investments in the arts,"Higher education institutions (HEIs) represent an enormous density of investment and resources, concentrating infrastructure spending and creating high human capital citizens and knowledge spillovers increasingly seen as critical to advancing regional quality of life. While HEIs’ prominent role in promoting regional economic growth, innovation, and attractiveness receives considerable research attention, most of that attention is paid to aspects of HEIs that are directly related to STEM activity. There are various theories that suggest spillovers from non-STEM activity at HEIs as well, specifically in the arts. This study examines whether spillovers occur for HEIs’ large capital investments in the arts. Specifically, we focus on HEI investments in arts physical infrastructure and whether these investments have any effects on regional-level business activity, including jobs and firms. To analyze HEI spillovers of physical arts infrastructure on regional jobs and firms, we use construction starts data on building projects from Dodge Analytics, Inc. and data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, which include administrative data for every college, university, and technical/vocational institution that participates in the federal student financial aid programs. We couple these data with public data on regional-level socioeconomic indicators from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Zip-code Business Patterns data. We employ a quasi-experimental propensity-score matching design in order to control for a host of HEI and regional-level characteristics in examining the impact of infrastructure investments. The results suggest strong and consistent spillover effects (i.e. overall and specifically in the arts industry) for regions with HEIs that make these investments.",Noonan D.; Woronkowicz J.; Hale J.,Journal,Journal of Technology Transfer,2021-12-01,Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis;Indiana University Bloomington,Arts ;  Cultural infrastructure ;  Higher education institutions ;  Spillovers
The Effects of Collaboration with Different Partners: A Contingency Model,"This article focuses on innovation collaboration and examines the different roles of the two types of innovation collaboration on firms' innovation performance from the perspective of the two types of knowledge distance. Based on this logic, the article also assesses whether the effects of these two types of collaboration are conditional on a firm's connections to the existing institutional structure in emerging markets. The regression results reveal that both collaboration with science-based partners and collaboration with foreign business partners are positively related to a firm's innovation performance, while the effect of collaboration with science-based partners is weaker. Our article also shows that a firm's connections to the institutional structure positively moderate the influence of collaboration with foreign business partners, while they negatively moderate the influence of collaboration with science-based partners. This article contributes to the existing research on innovation collaboration by providing a theoretical framework for understanding the distinct effects of collaborating with different types of partners.",Zhou J.; Liu Z.; Li J.; Zhang G.,Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2021-12-01,Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;Beijing Normal University,Connections to institutional structure ;  foreign business partner ;  innovation collaboration ;  innovation perfor-mance ;  science-based partner
Enhancing STEM equity programs with action research,"Cultural diversity in professional fields, including science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), leads to greater innovation due to the improved range of ideas, perspectives, and talents that a diverse workforce encompasses. However, despite increased efforts to recruit and retain traditionally underrepresented minority students through collegiate-level STEM equity initiatives, the lack of action research-based program evaluation leaves unanswered questions about the effectiveness of many STEM equity programs. The current article uses an example of a grant-funded collaboration between two Hispanic-serving institutions to explore how action research can enhance the planning, implementation, and evaluation of programs to address STEM inequity. A narrative of researcher-participants’ reflections illustrates the successes and shortcomings of the project and suggests four guidelines for enhancing STEM equity programs with action research.",Barber C.; Palasota J.; Steiger M.; Bagnall R.; Reina J.; Wagle J.; Bai Y.,Journal,Action Research,2021-12-01,University of St. Thomas - Houston;Houston Community College,Action research ;  equity ;  program evaluation ;  STEM

Development of an AR App to Improve Healthcare Students' Classroom Experience,"Augmented Reality (AR) is one of the most promising digital health innovations today. In the medical field, it is increasingly adopted as technological advancement in healthcare since it holds promise as a robust teaching initiative in the said field. However, most of the initiatives are conducted and analyzed in the developed countries. Its application and adoption seem to be challenging in developing countries like the Philippines, which may be attributed to the limited applied research or financial capability. Findings from this research also show only the knowledge acquisition from AR apps being developed rather than the effects of its inclusion on healthcare. Thus, this study was initiated to develop an AR app as a tool to improve the students' classroom experience. Specifically, this study is conducted to investigate AR app usability and its effects on healthcare students. Based on initial findings, AR integration in the classroom could have significant effects on healthcare students and clinical instructors. However, the psychologists observed that there remain several challenges and issues on its use that we need to consider in the development and use of this app. Thus, when the entire qualitative methodology is completed, it is expected that an AR app will be developed based on the initial findings. This study is also expected to produce an AR app that can be used as a mobile-based tool in medical education to contribute to the improvement of the healthcare students' classroom experience despite being in a developing country.",Trapero H.,Conference Proceeding,"29th International Conference on Computers in Education Conference, ICCE 2021 - Proceedings",2021-11-22,University of the Philippines,AR ;  Augmented reality ;  Education technology ;  Healthcare technology

"Building a Networked Improvement Community: Lessons in Organizing to Promote Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics","In 2016, 10 universities launched a Networked Improvement Community (NIC) aimed at increasing the number of scholars from Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) populations entering science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty careers. NICs bring together stakeholders focused on a common goal to accelerate innovation through structured, ongoing intervention development, implementation, and refinement. We theorized a NIC organizational structure would aid understandings of a complex problem in different contexts and accelerate opportunities to develop and improve interventions to address the problem. A distinctive feature of this NIC is its diverse institutional composition of public and private, predominantly white institutions, a historically Black university, a Hispanic-serving institution, and land grant institutions located across eight states and Washington, DC, United States. NIC members hold different positions within their institutions and have access to varied levers of change. Among the many lessons learned through this community case study, analyzing and addressing failed strategies is as equally important to a healthy NIC as is sharing learning from successful interventions. We initially relied on pre-existing relationships and assumptions about how we would work together, rather than making explicit how the NIC would develop, establish norms, understand common processes, and manage changing relationships. We had varied understandings of the depth of campus differences, sometimes resulting in frustrations about the disparate progress on goals. NIC structures require significant engagement with the group, often more intensive than traditional multi-institution organizational structures. They require time to develop and ongoing maintenance in order to advance the work. We continue to reevaluate our model for leadership, climate, diversity, conflict resolution, engagement, decision-making, roles, and data, leading to increased investment in the success of all NIC institutions. Our NIC has evolved from the traditional NIC model to become the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching and Learning (CIRTL) AGEP NIC model with five key characteristics: (1) A well-specified aim, (2) An understanding of systems, including a variety of contexts and different organizations, (3) A culture and practice of shared leadership and inclusivity, (4) The use of data reflecting different institutional contexts, and (5) The ability to accelerate infrastructure and interventions. We conclude with recommendations for those considering developing a NIC to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.",Noble C.; Amey M.; Colón L.; Conroy J.; De Cheke Qualls A.; Deonauth K.; Franke J.; Gardner A.; Goldberg B.; Harding T.; Harris G.; Hernández S.; Holland-Berry T.; Keeles O.; Knuth B.; McLinn C.; Milton J.; Motshubi R.; Ogilvie C.; Perez R.; Rodriguez S.; Ruggeri N.; Shiakolas P.; Woods A.,Journal,Frontiers in Psychology,2021-11-18,"University of Texas at Arlington College of Engineering;Texas A&M University-Commerce;University at Buffalo, The State University of New York;Michigan State University;University of Georgia;University of Michigan, Ann Arbor;Montana State University;University of Maryland, College Park;Howard University;Cornell University;Northwestern University;Iowa State University;The University of Texas at Arlington;Poly Prep Country Day School",diversity ;  faculty careers ;  Networked Improvement Community ;  shared leadership ;  STEM
An analysis of students’ perception of online assessments and its relation to motivation towards mathematics learning,"Assessing student performance is a challenge faced by most educational institutions during this time when conducting in-campus classes is affected by the pandemic. Use of online assessments to determine student performance is gaining wider acceptance over the traditional paper-and-pen type as it allows evaluation of what the students learned despite the lack of physical classroom interaction. Although there are studies that examine student perceptions about online learning in general, only a few focus on assessments especially those that consider its relation to affective aspects of learning. The views of students being the primary beneficiaries of the technology would give relevant information in designing appropriate online assessments and can bring about the success of its implementation. Thus, this present study investigated the usefulness of online assessments according to the perspective of students particularly in their math subject and its relation to their motivation towards mathematics learning. A mixed methods research design was conducted to determine the perception and motivation of 127 second year level engineering students via a questionnaire survey after exposure to a set of online assessments. Results showed that students have a high level of motivation towards mathematics learning and have positive perception about online assessments. Using factor analysis, variations in the perception were found to be explained by 4 factors focused on ease of use and functionality, personal preference, technical considerations, and complementation with other methods. Some of these factors were found to be significantly related with various aspects of motivation. Interview of students also revealed they found taking online assessments a positive innovation in giving assignments and prefer them over traditional assignments. The findings derived from this study give teachers a basis in designing more effective online assessments particularly those that address the needs of today’s generation of learners. Further, for a developing country like the Philippines, findings of this study would greatly contribute to the government and academic sector’s efforts in capacity building of its online system of education.",Valdez M.; Maderal L.,Journal,Electronic Journal of e-Learning,2021-11-16,De La Salle University,Learning management system ;  Mathematics learning ;  Motivation ;  Online assessment ;  Perception ;  Technology
"Dr Homayoon Kazerooni: Professor at UC-Berkeley, pioneer of exoskeletons, founder and CEO of U.S. Bionics (DBA suitX), founder Ekso Bionics","Purpose: The following paper is a “Q&A interview” conducted by Joanne Pransky of Industrial Robot Journal as a method to impart the combined technological, business and personal experience of a prominent, robotic industry PhD-turned innovator and entrepreneur regarding his pioneering efforts. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: The interviewee is Dr Homayoon Kazerooni, Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the University of California (UC) Berkeley, pioneer and leading entrepreneur of robotic exoskeletons. He is a foremost expert in robotics, control sciences, exoskeletons, bioengineering and mechatronics design. Kazerooni shares in this interview details on his second start-up, US Bionics DBA suitX. Findings: Kazerooni received his MS and PhD in Mechanical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He has been a Professor at UC Berkeley for over 30 years. He also serves as the Director of the Berkeley Robotics and Human Engineering Laboratory “KAZ LAB.” The lab’s early research focused on enhancing human upper extremity strength, and Kazerooni led his team to successfully develop a new class of intelligent assist devices that are currently marketed worldwide and used by manual laborers in distribution centers and factories worldwide. Dr Kazerooni’s later work focused on the control of human–machine systems specific to human lower extremities. After developing BLEEX, ExoHiker and ExoClimber – three load-carrying exoskeletons – his team at Berkeley created Human Universal Load Carrier. It was the first energetically autonomous, orthotic, lower extremity exoskeleton that allowed its user to carry 100-pound weights in various terrains for an extended period, without becoming physically overwhelmed. The technology was initially licensed to Ekso Bionics and then Lockheed Martin. Kazerooni and his team also developed lower-extremity technology to aid persons who have experienced a stroke, spinal cord injuries or have health conditions that obligate them to use a wheelchair. Originality/value: In 2005, Kazerooni founded Ekso Bionics, the very first exoskeleton company in America, which went on to become a publicly owned company in 2014. Ekso, currently marketed by Ekso Bionics, was designed jointly between Ekso Bionics and Berkeley for paraplegics and those with mobility disorders to stand and walk with little physical exertion. In 2011, Austin Whitney, a Berkeley student suffering from lower limb paralysis, walked for commencement in one of Kazerooni’s exoskeletons, “The Austin Exoskeleton Project,” named in honor of Whitney. Kazerooni went on in 2011, to found US Bionics, DBA suitX, a venture capital, industry and government-funded robotics exoskeleton company. suitX’s core technology is focused on the design and manufacturing of affordable industrial and medical exoskeletons to improve the lives of workers and people with gait impairment. suitX has received investment from Wistron (Taiwan), been awarded several US government awards and won two Saint-Gobain NOVA Innovation Awards. suitX has also won the US$1m top prize in the “UAE AI and Robotics for Good” Competition. Its novel health-care exoskeleton Phoenix has recently received FDA approval. Kazerooni has won numerous awards including Discover magazine’s Technological Innovation Award, the McKnight-Land Grant Professorship and has been a recipient of the outstanding ASME Investigator Award. His research was recognized as the most innovative technology of the year in New York Times Magazine. He has served in a variety of leadership roles in the mechanical engineering community and served as editor of two journals: ASME Journal of Dynamics Systems and Control and IEEE Transaction on Mechatronics.

Artificial intelligence in ophthalmopathy and ultra-wide field image: A survey,"Fundus digital photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are currently the primary imaging approaches for early diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases. In recent years, the significant development in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) are new and vital technical-driven motivations impacting on the traditional diagnosis and treatment methods. At the same time, the ultra-wide field (UWF) imaging technology is getting widely accepted and prevalent by its obvious advantageous features of non-dilate pupils, express-track result and the vast pool of fundus viewing angles.

Study on coordination of industrial technology ambidextrous innovation in knowledge ecology spiral,"Purpose: Knowledge input development and innovation implementation are new features of industrial technology innovation. The purpose of this study is to find the process of coordination and ecological spiral in the ambidextrous innovation of industrial technology. Design/methodology/approach: To design the model of industrial technology ambidextrous innovation based on knowledge ecology spiral, an input-output model of knowledge for ambidextrous innovation and a spiral model of knowledge ecology were constructed based on an improved Lotka-Volterra model. Then, the equilibriums in different knowledge inputs and the spiral evolution of knowledge ecology were analyzed. Finally, the ambidextrous coordination mechanism of the core organization was revealed. Findings: By coordinating the knowledge inputs and the knowledge ecology spiral, enterprises extend the R&D investments in the innovation chain, which will facilitate the knowledge inputs of the exploitative and exploratory innovation. Implementing the ambidextrous coordination in the technology innovation chain and the knowledge ecology chain has the advantage of promoting knowledge inputs, mobility and ecological spiral. Meanwhile, it can achieve the “multi-source, integration and coordination” development of industrial technology innovation. Originality/value: The two-element innovative knowledge input coordination model and the knowledge ecological spiral model based on the improved Lotka-Volterra model are constructed, which extends the modeling way of the traditional knowledge input-output profit model. It is expected to reduce the amount of knowledge input of a single member and provide theoretical reference for improving the efficiency of knowledge input by constructing the inter-dependent regenerative and inter-generative knowledge interaction.",Long Y.; Liu P.,Journal,Kybernetes,2021-11-15,Chongqing Technology and Business University;Henan Agricultural University,Coordination ;  Industrial technology ambidextrous innovation ;  Knowledge ecology ;  Knowledge spiral
An investigation of knowledge protection practices in inter-organisational collaboration: protecting specialised engineering knowledge with a practice based on grey-box modelling,"Purpose: This paper aims to report an interview study investigating knowledge protection practices in a collaborative research and innovation project centred around the semi-conductor industry. The authors explore which and how knowledge protection practices are applied and zoom in on a particular one to investigate the perspective of three stakeholders which collaborate: the SUPPLIER of a specialised machine, the APPLIER of this machine and a SCHOLAR who collaborates with both, in an effort to develop a grey-box model of the machine and its operation. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 33 interviews have been conducted in two rounds: 30 interviews explore knowledge protection practices applied across a large project. Qualitative content analysis is applied to determine practices not well covered by the research community. A total of three follow-up interviews inspect one specific collaboration case of three partners. Quotes from all interviews are used to illustrate the participants’ viewpoints and motivation. Findings: SCHOLAR and APPLIER communicate using a data-centric knowledge protection practice, in that concrete parameter values are sensitive and hidden by communicating data within a wider parameter range. This practice balances the benefit that all three stakeholders have from communicating about specifics of machine design and operations. The grey-box model combines engineering knowledge of both SUPPLIER and APPLIER. Practical implications: The line of thought described in this study is applicable to comparable collaboration constellations of a SUPPLIER of a machine, an APPLIER of a machine and a SCHOLAR who analyses and draws insights out of data. Originality/value: The paper fills a research gap by reporting on applied knowledge protection practices and characterising a data-centric knowledge protection practice around a grey-box model.",Kaiser R.; Thalmann S.; Pammer-Schindler V.,Journal,VINE Journal of Information and Knowledge Management Systems,2021-11-11,"Know-Center, Graz;Universität Graz;Technische Universitat Graz","Knowledge protection, Protection practices ;  Knowledge sharing"
Power intelligent customer service robot based on artificial intelligence,"With the rapid development of speech recognition technology, voice chat robot has become a breakthrough of artificial intelligence. Voice chat robot should be a typical application field of customer service, providing customers with efficient and convenient service all day. The traditional customer service center is mainly based on telephone service, facing the problems of large number of customers, high maintenance cost, slow knowledge update, limited service time, low training cost and so on. So, at the same time, the use habits of customers have also changed fundamentally. The vast majority of services and transactions can be carried out through the Internet, such as Taobao and Jingdong. However, the quality and cost of voice services can be greatly reduced through the interaction between robots and channelization voice service centers. Through the research and development of natural language technology, an intelligent and centralized mobile communication service application platform is constructed by using we-chat platform. Through natural language processing, machine learning, big data computing and other technological innovation, we focus on the use of online robot recognition to understand customer problems and timely feedback customer needs. The results show that in the statistics of customer service machine problems, the highest proportion of consumers' problems about payment is 37%, and the lowest is 29%.",Chen L.,Conference Proceeding,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,2021-11-10,Guangdong Normal University of Technology,Artificial Intelligence ;  Customer Service System ;  Intelligent Customer Service ;  Robot
Injections and biomaterials,"Injection-based therapies and biomaterials can be used for the management of a variety of urological disorders. Experimental data has shown their potential to provide minimally invasive solutions for prevalent conditions such as benign prostatic obstruction, erectile dysfunction, stress urinary incontinence, and pelvic organ prolapse. Furthermore, acellular biomaterials and cell-seeded scaffolds were tested for the purpose of bladder augmentation or reconstruction in patients with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction who would otherwise destined to undergo bowel interposition and be exposed to its inherent morbidities. Biomaterials were also used for the treatment of complicated urethral strictures, in the context of tubularized or augmentation urethroplasty. Herein, we reviewed and discussed the relevant literature, focusing on the clinical trials with a relatively higher degree of evidence. Despite promising results achieved in animal studies, many of the discussed therapeutic novelties lack robust clinical data to justify their routine use in practice. Putting synthetic biomaterials that have been used in pelvic floor reconstruction aside, the major advantage of utilizing such treatment alternatives would be their favorable adverse effect profile rather than the magnitude and durability of their clinical benefit. Nevertheless, they may serve well to meet the expectations of selected patients who prioritize minimally invasiveness and aim to avoid major complications that would necessitate additional intervention and/or be a cause of long lasting morbidity. Additionally, most of these treatment alternatives (especially the injectables) are replicable and do not preclude the application of subsequent, more invasive and potentially more definitive procedures. Given the recent innovations in drug development and delivery systems together with the rise of tissue engineering applications in regenerative urology, further research with potentially ""practice-changing"" results are awaited related to the clinical use of injections and biomaterials in urological disorders.",Acar Ö.; Kocjancic E.,Book,Urologic Surgery in the Digital Era: Next Generation Surgery and Novel Pathways,2021-11-09,University of Illinois College of Medicine,Biomaterial ;  Bulking agent ;  Erectile dysfunction ;  Incontinence ;  Injection ;  Neurogenic bladder ;  Peyronie's disease ;  Prolapse ;  Stem cell ;  Urethra
"APIs, the glue under the hood. Looking for the “API economy”","Purpose: Some specialized consultancies have been making the case of an “API economy”. This study aims to investigate the issue, marshalling data on the economic dimension, to better understand the environments of APIs. It offers an overview of the functions and definition of application programming interfaces (APIs) in the backdrop of the history of services computing. The paper attempt assessing the economic value (size of the market) of APIs and reviews some of the available metrics. The paper also takes a look some issues and challenges ahead for the deployment of all kind of APIs. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on desk research and a scientific and grey literature review. However, it relies mostly on specialized consultancies although from a critical viewpoint. The paper provides an historical account of the notions of APIs and API economy. Findings: The paper questions the idea of an “API economy” that still stands on the “hype” side and is not clearly substantiated. It reveals that the number of firms with mature API programs remains small and that there is an uneven development across industries (traditional firms are less active than digital natives) and countries (Silicon Valley is leading). It highlights that the domination of IT companies (leaders and pioneers of APIs) raises issue of competition and at some point, may prevent rather than foster innovation. Research limitations/implications: There is no robust data about the size of the API market nor about its value. Sources are highly heterogeneous and delimitations not always precise. The standard metrics or indicators are hard to find. Further research would be needed to better document this area. Practical implications: The paper reviews some of the expected benefits of the use of APIs as enablers of private or public ecosystems. Social implications: The paper delineates some of the economic benefits of the public APIs based on open data. It shows some positive examples of public APIs in the EU. Originality/value: There is hardly any mention of the API economy in research literature. Most of the academic literature still stems from engineering department or business-management departments, not department of economics. Consultants would usually focus on the potential of business growth, on how to design an effective API strategy but not on the very economic dimension. The paper attempts providing a synthesis of the available data.",Simon J.,Journal,"Digital Policy, Regulation and Governance",2021-11-09,JPS Public Policy Consulting,Computer applications ;  Computer software ;  Economics ;  Innovation ;  Open systems ;  Technology led strategy
Extending Our Scientific Reach in Arboreal Ecosystems for Research and Management,"The arboreal ecosystem is vitally important to global and local biogeochemical processes, the maintenance of biodiversity in natural systems, and human health in urban environments. The ability to collect samples, observations, and data to conduct meaningful scientific research is similarly vital. The primary methods and modes of access remain limited and difficult. In an online survey, canopy researchers (n = 219) reported a range of challenges in obtaining adequate samples, including ∼10% who found it impossible to procure what they needed. Currently, these samples are collected using a combination of four primary methods: (1) sampling from the ground; (2) tree climbing; (3) constructing fixed infrastructure; and (4) using mobile aerial platforms, primarily rotorcraft drones. An important distinction between instantaneous and continuous sampling was identified, allowing more targeted engineering and development strategies. The combination of methods for sampling the arboreal ecosystem provides a range of possibilities and opportunities, particularly in the context of the rapid development of robotics and other engineering advances. In this study, we aim to identify the strategies that would provide the benefits to a broad range of scientists, arborists, and professional climbers and facilitate basic discovery and applied management. Priorities for advancing these efforts are (1) to expand participation, both geographically and professionally; (2) to define 2–3 common needs across the community; (3) to form and motivate focal teams of biologists, tree professionals, and engineers in the development of solutions to these needs; and (4) to establish multidisciplinary communication platforms to share information about innovations and opportunities for studying arboreal ecosystems.",Cannon C.; Borchetta C.; Anderson D.; Arellano G.; Barker M.; Charron G.; LaMontagne J.; Richards J.; Abercrombie E.; Banin L.; Tagle Casapia X.; Chen X.; Degtjarenko P.; Dell J.; Durden D.; Guevara Andino J.; Hernández-Gutiérrez R.; Hirons A.; Kua C.; La Vigne H.; Leponce M.; Lim J.; Lowman M.; Marshall A.; Michaletz S.; Normark B.; Penneys D.; Schneider G.; Strijk J.; Tiamiyu B.; Trammell T.; Vargas-Rodriguez Y.; Weintraub-Leff S.; Lussier Desbiens A.; Spenko M.,Journal,Frontiers in Forests and Global Change,2021-11-08,"Armour College of Engineering;Universidad de las Americas - Ecuador;Myerscough College;National Ecological Observatory Network;Instituto de Investigaciones de la Amazonía Peruana;Universiti Brunei Darussalam;Tartu Ülikool;Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México;Utah State University;University of North Carolina Wilmington;Yunnan University;DePaul University;University of Michigan, Ann Arbor;Morton Arboretum;University of Delaware;Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis;University of Louisville;National University of Singapore;University of Aberdeen;University of Massachusetts Amherst;Université de Sherbrooke;University of Ilorin;The University of British Columbia;Universidad de Guadalajara;Western Carolina University;Wageningen University & Research;Université Libre de Bruxelles;Canopy Watch International;TREE Foundation;UK Centre for Ecology Hydrology",arbornaut ;  canopy access ;  canopy biology ;  canopy crane ;  Drones (UAV) ;  epiphytic ;  robotics ;  sampling design ;  tree climbing
Development Status and Prospect of Tunnel Grouting Technology,"The development status of tunnel grouting technology recently is summarized as follows. (1) Tunnel grouting technology develops rapidly with engineering construction, and its relevance continuously increases. The application scenarios have extended from water blocking and ground improvement to engineering emergency rescue, disease control, gas prevention and control, thermal insulation, etc. (2) Significant breakthroughs have been made in grouting theory, materials, equipment, and effect inspection methods, thereby promoting the development of tunnel grouting technology and realizing highly efficient and controllable grouting. (3) The tunnel grouting technology has overcome the construction limitations of various extremely complex strata, such as underwater weathered groove, (high pressure) water-rich fault fracture zone / dense joint zone, and water-rich fine sand layer. The Chinese tunnel grouting technology has reached an international advanced level. With the construction and planning of the Sichuan-Tibet railway and the strait-crossing tunnels, tunnel construction has further penetrated the once restricted areas of engineering geology and problems such as extremely high-water pressure, high-permeable strata, high-ground stress, high-ground temperature, and high-active faults are becoming prominent. Thus, further deepening of grouting theory study, innovation and optimization of grouting technology, research and development of new grouting materials, customized matching drilling equipment, and quantitative determination of grouting effect are required to promote the continuous development of tunnel grouting technology.",Zhuo Y.; Li Z.; Gao G.,Journal,Tunnel Construction,2021-11-01,State Key Laboratory of Shield Machine and Boring Technology;CRTG;Ltd.,deep weathered groove ;  development of grouting technology ;  high ground temperature ;  high water pressure ;  tunnel with complex geologies
In-Network Neural Networks: Challenges and Opportunities for Innovation,"The quest for self-driving networks poses growing pressure to manage network events at a nano-second scale. In this article, we make a case for leveraging programmable forwarding planes to achieve self-driving networks and respond to their dynamism in real time by in-network intelligence and without performing traffic steering/mirroring to centralized management solutions (intelligent or not). We briefly cover throughout the article preliminary ideas in the in-network neural networks field and discuss the technical challenges of running machine learning techniques entirely in the forwarding plane. We also highlight potential use cases of having an autonomous intelligent network capable of self-adapting to dynamic network behavior changes with minimal to no human intervention, including smart network telemetry, smart traffic engineering, real-time flow classification, and network tomography.

"Territorial articulation of pesticides management in the framework of phytosanitary protection. The case of the agricultural valley of Rioverde and Ciudad Fernández, San Luis Potosí","The purpose of plant health and protection is to generate actions for the control of agricultural pests and diseases, the use of pesticides and the determination of phytosanitary status for commercialization within the framework of food safety. However, plant protection as a normative and regulatory instrument has remained on the global and national scale, when pest management is mainly local. There is an institutional and territorial disarticulation regarding the regulation of pesticides. At a global level, Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was recognized as the public policy of pest management and control, at the local level, this structure did not arrive and is not applied due to the lack of a phytosanitary extension model. This means that the only means to eradicate agricultural pests is the indiscriminate use of pesticides, some prohibited, in other countries due to the significant effects on human health and the environment. However, Mexico allows its distribution and commercialization. The research was developed in the agricultural valley of Rioverde and Ciudad Fernández, two municipalities in the state of San Luis Potosí, considered an area of great importance in agricultural terms, above all, due to its high productivity of orange cultivation. It has also been characterized by the use of dangerous pesticides, which has affected the health of the population and concern for its most important resource, water. Due to the aforementioned, this work aimed to demonstrate that territorial governance problems constitute the most important challenge to face and solve the pesticide problem in Mexico. The methodological process had a qualitative and quantitative approach based on the extension of innovation through geotechnologies for the identification of areas and plots with greater use of pesticides to combat pests and diseases of crops. The methodological process consisted of two phases: A) the sampling was through the mobile application called ""Agroquímicos LAGES"" developed by the National Laboratory of Geoprocessing of Phytosanitary Information (LaNGIF), this process was in charge of students of Engineering in Agricultural Innovation Sustainable Institute of the Higher Technological Institute (ITS) and of Agroindustrial Engineering and Agronomic Engineering in Phytotechnics of the Autonomous University of San Luis Potosí (UASLP), generating a database with 22,939 data on producers, crops and pesticides; b) The data analysis consisted, first of all, in making a distinction between permitted and restricted pesticides detected in the area based on the Registry of Canceled Pesticides and Nutrients of the Federal Commission for Protection against Sanitary Risks (COFEPRIS) for later apply the non-parametric statistical hypothesis test Chi square (X2) and thus determine the existence of association between the level of education, type of crop (vegetables, corn and orange) and the taxonomic group with pesticides, likewise an analysis was carried out Multicriteria to identify and classify, through spatial nodes, the areas with restricted pesticide application and in turn, the characterization of the producers, the cultivation and the land tenure. As a result, it was obtained that the ""agronomic houses"" control the management of pesticides, which are small private businesses that face lax agricultural, environmental and health policies, and act outside the state and national regulations; In statistical terms, the crops with the highest frequency of restricted pesticide use were corn and vegetables, and in spatial terms, restricted pesticides such as: Diazinon, Glyphosate, Carbofuran, Chlorpyrifos Ethyl, Methamidophos, Metomil and Monocrotophos are applied in the El Refugio ejido. all Highly Hazardous Pesticides (HHP). Given this scenario, it is considered necessary to generate inventories according to the phytosanitary status of pests and diseases, in addition to diagnoses on the use of pesticides at a local scale. Without this, actions aimed at solving, remedying and reducing the economic, environmental and health problems caused by said disarticulation are difficult. The methodological triad that consisted of the use of geotechnologies, statistical analysis and spatial analysis allows us to generate diagnoses and monitor the use and management of pesticides, at low cost and at a local scale. It is important to note that the identification of the areas with the greatest application of restricted pesticides does not have the motivation to transfer responsibility to the producer. On the contrary, they are intended to direct phytosanitary extension actions to specific sites.",Mendoza M.; Galicia N.; Servín C.; Salas G.; Rocha S.,Journal,Investigaciones Geograficas,2021-11-01,Universidad Autónoma de San Luis Potosí,Agronomic houses ;  Mobile applications ;  Pesticides ;  Phytosanitary protection ;  Plant health
The Decision Phases Framework for Public Engagement: Engaging Stakeholders about Gene Editing in the Wild,"Some experts and advocates propose environmental biotechnologies such as genetic engineering, gene drive systems, and synthetic biology as potential solutions to accelerating rates of species loss. While these tools may offer hope for a seemingly intractable problem, they also present potential governance challenges for which innovative decision-making systems are required. Two of the perennial governance challenges include, when are broader stakeholder groups involved in these decisions and who exactly should be involved? We propose the decision phases framework—which includes research and development, regulatory review, and deployment, management, and monitoring—as a framework for identifying which stakeholders might be best suited for different phases throughout the innovation and deployment of emerging environmental biotechnologies for species protection.",Barnhill-Dilling S.; Kokotovich A.; Delborne J.,Journal,Hastings Center Report,2021-11-01,,bioethics ;  democratic deliberation ;  environmental governance ;  governance of environmental biotechnologies ;  stakeholder engagement

Recent advances in natural materials for corneal tissue engineering,"Given the incidence of corneal dysfunctions and diseases worldwide and the limited availability of healthy, human donors, investigators are working to generate engineered cellular and acellular therapeutic approaches as alternatives to corneal transplants from human cadavers. These engineered strategies aim to address existing complications with human corneal transplants,including graft rejection, infection, and complications resulting from surgical methodologies. The main goals of these research endeavors are to (1) determine ideal mechanical properties, (2) devise methodologies to improve the efficacy of engineered corneal grafts and cell-based therapies, and (3) optimize transplantation of engineered tissue structures in the eye. Thus, recent innovations have sought to address these challenges through both in vitro and in vivo studies. This review covers recent work aimed at evaluating engineered materials, potential therapeutic cells, and the resulting cell-material interactions that lead to optimal corneal graft properties.

The future of biomolecular simulation in the pharmaceutical industry: What we can learn from aerodynamics modelling and weather prediction. Part 1. understanding the physical and computational complexity of in silico drug design,"The predictive power of simulation has become embedded in the infrastructure of modern economies. Computer-aided design is ubiquitous throughout industry. In aeronautical engineering, built infrastructure and materials manufacturing, simulations are routinely used to compute the performance of potential designs before construction. The ability to predict the behaviour of products is a driver of innovation by reducing the cost barrier to new designs, but also because radically novel ideas can be piloted with relatively little risk. Accurate weather forecasting is essential to guide domestic and military flight paths, and therefore the underpinning simulations are critical enough to have implications for national security. However, in the pharmaceutical and biotechnological industries, the application of computer simulations remains limited by the capabilities of the technology with respect to the complexity of molecular biology and human physiology. Over the last 30 years, molecular-modelling tools have gradually gained a degree of acceptance in the pharmaceutical industry. Drug discovery has begun to benefit from physics-based simulations. While such simulations have great potential for improved molecular design, much scepticism remains about their value. The motivations for such reservations in industry and areas where simulations show promise for efficiency gains in preclinical research are discussed. In this, the first of two complementary papers, the scientific and technical progress that needs to be made to improve the predictive power of biomolecular simulations, and how this might be achieved, is firstly discussed (Part 1). In Part 2, the status of computer simulations in pharma is contrasted with aerodynamics modelling and weather forecasting, and comments are made on the cultural changes needed for equivalent computational technologies to become integrated into life-science industries.",Edwards T.; Foloppe N.; Harris S.; Wells G.,Journal,Acta Crystallographica Section D: Structural Biology,2021-11-01,UCL School of Pharmacy;University of Leeds;Vernalis PLC,Biomolecular simulation ;  In silico drug design ;  Molecular docking ;  Pharmaceutical industry
Flipped learning in engineering modules is more than watching videos: The development of personal and professional skills,"The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) has highlighted two key outcomes for students of all accredited engineering programs: the ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences and the capacity to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies. Likewise, in recent years, written exams, assignments, and oral presentations show transmission-skill deficiencies among engineering students. Flipped teaching serves to boost students to meet these outcomes and other competencies: comprehension reading, communication skills, character building, collaborative work, critical thinking, or creativity. So, flipped learning is more than watching videos. This research proposes two evidence-based transferable learning strategies built on a flipped-teaching model and was applied by the authors in engineering courses during the second year of the global pandemic caused by COVID-19: problem-based learning and teamwork assignments. The study comprised two phases. First, a systematic review of reports, writings, and exams delivered by students. It included some video-watching analytics to detect misuse. In the second stage, the authors ascertained trends of these outcomes. Student perceptions and other achievement indicators illustrate the possibilities for encouraging learners to achieve transmission, communication, and literacy outcomes. Results indicate that these learner-centered approaches may help students learn better, comprehend, apply, and transmit knowledge. But they require an institutional commitment to implementing proactive instruction techniques that emphasize the importance of student communication skills.",Suárez F.; Mosquera-Feijóo J.; Chiyón I.; Alberti M.,Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2021-11-01,Universidad de Piura;Universidad Politécnica de Madrid;Universidad de Jaén,COVID-19 ;  Educational change ;  Educational innovation ;  Engineering education ;  Engineering outcomes ;  Flipped learning ;  Instructional materials ;  Meaningful learning ;  Personal competencies
A multidisciplinary perspective of ultra-processed foods and associated food processing technologies: A view of the sustainable road ahead,"Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are negatively perceived by part of the scientific community, the public, and policymakers alike, to the extent they are sometimes referred to as not “real food”. Many observational surveys have linked consumption of UPFs to adverse health outcomes. This narrative synthesis and scientific reappraisal of available evidence aims to: (i) critically evaluate UPF-related scientific literature on diet and disease and identify possible research gaps or biases in the interpretation of data; (ii) emphasize the innovative potential of various processing technologies that can lead to modifications of the food matrix with beneficial health effects; (iii) highlight the possible links between processing, sustainability and circular economy through the valorisation of by-products; and (iv) delineate the conceptual parameters of new paradigms in food evaluation and classification systems. Although greater consumption of UPFs has been associated with obesity, unfavorable cardiometabolic risk factor profiles, and increased risk for non-communicable diseases, whether specific food processing techniques leading to ultra-processed formulations are responsible for the observed links between UPFs and various health outcomes remains elusive and far from being understood. Evolving technologies can be used in the context of sustainable valorisation of food processing by-products to create novel, low-cost UPFs with improved nutritional value and health potential. New paradigms of food evaluation and assessment should be funded and developed on several novel pillars—enginomics, signalling, and precision nutrition—taking advantage of available digital technologies and artificial intelligence. Research is needed to generate required scientific knowledge to either expand the current or create new food evaluation and classification systems, incorporating processing aspects that may have a significant impact on health and wellness, together with factors related to the personalization of foods and diets, while not neglecting recycling and sustainability aspects. The complexity and the predicted immense size of these tasks calls for open innovation mentality and a new mindset promoting multidisciplinary collaborations and partnerships between academia and industry.",Capozzi F.; Magkos F.; Fava F.; Milani G.; Agostoni C.; Astrup A.; Saguy I.,Journal,Nutrients,2021-11-01,Københavns Universitet;Università degli Studi di Milano;Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna;Hebrew University of Jerusalem;Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico;Novo Nordisk Foundation,Circular economy ;  Enginomics ;  Food processing and technology ;  Precision nutrition ;  Sustainability
Integrating TTF and UTAUT2 theories to investigate the adoption of augmented reality technology in education: Perspective from a developing country,"Augmented reality (AR) has gained increased recognition in varying fields, in particular educational contexts. In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, home-based learning becomes a reality and is already in place across the globe, and learning via augmented reality technology will help learners comprehend learning content in a more creative frame of mind than ever before. Very little research has examined the adoption behavior of augmented reality in developing country perspectives. Therefore, there is a pressing necessity to understand the dynamics of augmented reality adoption for the benefit of motivating and inspiring students to adopt this highly innovative and impactful type of technology in the learning process. Against this background, the authors proposed and tested a model based on integrating Task-Technology Fit (TTF) and UTUAT2 theories. The results reveal the positive effect of task technology fit, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating condition, and hedonic motivation on behavioral intention (BI) in the adoption process of augmented reality in educational settings, where price value is found to exert little influence on behavioral intention. This model explains 49% of the variance in intentional behavior to adopt AR technology in the educational context. The conclusions of this study will add to the literature more informative knowledge leading to increased awareness of the dynamics and behaviors of AR adoption in a developing country perspective.

What are socially disruptive technologies?,"Scholarly discourse on “disruptive technologies” has been strongly influenced by disruptive innovation theory. This theory is tailored for analyzing disruptions in markets and business. It is of limited use, however, in analyzing the broader social, moral and existential dynamics of technosocial disruption. Yet these broader dynamics should be of great scholarly concern, both in coming to terms with technological disruptions of the past and those of our current age. Technologies can disrupt social relations, institutions, epistemic paradigms, foundational concepts, values, and even the nature of human cognition and experience – domains of disruption that are largely neglected in existing discourse on disruptive technologies. Accordingly, this paper seeks to reorient scholarly discussion around a broader notion of technosocial disruption. This broader notion raises three foundational questions. First, how can technosocial disruption be conceptualized in a way that clearly sets it apart from the disruptive innovation framework? Secondly, how does the notion of technosocial disruption relate to the concordant notions of “disruptor” and “disruptiveness”? Thirdly, can we advance criteria to assess the “degree of social disruptiveness” of different technologies? The paper clarifies these questions and proposes an answer to each of them. In doing so, it advances “technosocial disruption” as a key analysandum for future scholarship on the interactions between technology and society.",Hopster J.,Journal,Technology in Society,2021-11-01,Universiteit Twente,Disruptive technologies ;  Disruptiveness ;  Society ;  Technology ;  Technosocial disruption
Electric vehicle industry sustainable development with a stakeholder engagement system,"Electric vehicles emerge as the possible strategy for decarbonization and green transportation due to social demand. Researchers have made multiple efforts and initiatives as the demand surge for sustainable development in the electric vehicle industry. This study analyzes the relevant research of the industry, thereby explores electric vehicle industry development trends with a scientometrics-based data evaluation system, where three key topics are detected: “Vehicle Exhaust Emissions”, “Climate Change”, and “Integration”. The results are visualized in the view of clusters, timeline, and time zone to explore the dynamic direction and future trends of the industry. Further trend detection and forward-looking analysis suggest the significance of stakeholders and their interconnection. In response to the significant challenges in sustainable development, this study proposes the stakeholder engagement system in a comprehensive perspective.

Design for assistive technology oriented to design methodology: a systematic review on user-centered design and 3D printing approaches,"This paper presents a systematic review whose objective is to map the design development of assistive devices through user’s participation, use of design methodology and also 3D printing support. The development of multidisciplinary engineering design has increasingly demanded the need for effective participation of different stakeholders throughout product development cycle. Assistive Technology represents this multidisciplinary domain in the context of design for customization. This design approach requires the co-participation of the users, both occupational therapists and end users and also family members. This interactive process is fundamental in the early phases of the design and in the iterations to promote improvements between conceptual and functional prototypes. The research methodology is based on the three-stage systematic literature review, followed by a critical analysis grounded on content analysis procedures. The 30 approaches identified were classified according to their theoretical and practical characteristics (short descriptions, design development phases, design methods and techniques used and evaluation tools). The results point to the gap in the conceptual phase related to use of design methods and techniques, precisely the design early level where there is greatest potential to add value with innovation and functionality to the final product. This systematic review reinforces the increasingly importance of this integration between engineering and assistive technology, seeking to establish a systematization of the process of development of ADs that incorporates the qualities of both the areas: the technical knowledge, tools and development methodology and the user-centered approach together with the knowledge of therapeutic needs and occupational performance.",Santos A.; Silveira Z.,Journal,Journal of the Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering,2021-11-01,Universidade de São Paulo,Assistive technology ;  Co-design ;  Design for additive manufacturing ;  Participatory design ;  UCD ;  User-centered design
What is the role of telecommunications infrastructure construction in green technology innovation? A firm-level analysis for China,"Telecommunications infrastructure can lead to network spillovers and has the advantages of breaking spatial barriers, reducing transaction costs, and fostering business model innovation. In this way, it can promote the proliferation and progress of green technology and may impact green technology innovation. This paper studies the impact of telecommunications infrastructure on green technology innovation, identifies its mechanism, and analyzes the scale, structure, and heterogeneity of its effects. This research treats the Broadband China pilot policy as a quasinatural experiment in telecommunications infrastructure and uses firm- and city-level data from 2008 to 2018 to conduct a difference-in-difference (DID) model analysis. The study finds that telecommunications infrastructure promotes green technology innovation. However, telecommunications infrastructure has a more significant impact in promoting low- rather than high-quality green technology innovation. Additionally, the results of the mediating effect analysis show that telecommunications infrastructure stimulates corporate green technology innovation by improving the level of informatization, increasing media attention and improving corporate governance. It is noteworthy that, when heterogeneity in enterprise ownership, financing constraints, and technology level is considered, non-state-owned enterprises and enterprises with low financing constraints and a high technology level are found to be more clearly affected by telecommunications infrastructure.",Tang C.; Xu Y.; Hao Y.; Wu H.; Xue Y.,Journal,Energy Economics,2021-11-01,Hunan University;Central South University;Beijing Institute of Technology,Broadband China policy ;  Difference-in-difference model ;  Green technology innovation ;  Telecommunications infrastructure
Mini-review: Rehabilitation engineering: Research priorities and trends,"Rehabilitation Engineering is the use of engineering principles applied to rehabilitation, disability, and independent living. Google Scholar is a searchable resource that allows people from around the world to create profiles of their interests and collaborations, and it provides a means to search the broad scientific and technical literature. Google Scholar was used to identify the 150 most cited people who listed Rehabilitation Engineering in their profile. Research impact, characteristics, and areas of research of the most cited rehabilitation engineers were examined. Furthermore, gender and geographical differences in research metrics of the highest citied rehabilitation engineers were investigated. Consumer priorities in rehabilitation engineering were identified using a voice of consumer (VoC) survey and recent literature based on VoC studies. Gaps between research publication and activities and consumer priorities were identified to recommend seven areas of research with high demand and opportunity for growth and innovation. Implications. • Rehabilitation Engineering appears to be a male-dominated profession similar to other engineering disciplines. • There are disparities in the number of rehabilitation engineers and measures of scientific productivity between different regions of the world. • Despite people identifying as rehabilitation engineers in every region, the most cited were identified as working in the World Health Organization Region of Americas and the European Region. • There appears to be benefits for rehabilitation engineers who have multiple collaborations and who work in doctoral degree-granting institutions. • Seven areas of research identified as consumer priorities were not captured by the most cited rehabilitation engineers these include: 1) Transportation and automobile driving 2) Recreation/Leisure 3) Autonomous vehicles/wheelchairs 4) Smart home/IoT 5) Computer/mobile applications and telecommunications 6) Patient transfer devices 7) Power sources.

"Digital skills, relatedness and green diversification: A study of European regions","Prior research identifies relatedness as a key driver of new specializations in the domain of green technologies. The present paper extends the evolutionary economic geography framework by focussing on digital literacy. Specifically, we argue that workforce skills associated with the use and development of ICT technologies are an important, if understudied, determinant of regional diversification into new green technologies. Accordingly, we analyse their relationships with relatedness and green diversification using panel data on 142 European regions for the period 2006 – 2013. We find that e-skills endowment is a positive predictor of regions’ ability to specialise in new technological domains, and especially for green specializations. Further, e-skills negatively moderate the effect of relatedness on technological diversification. These results call attention to the potential of digitalisation in the context of the transition towards a greener economy.",Santoalha A.; Consoli D.; Castellacci F.,Journal,Research Policy,2021-11-01,CSIC-UPV - Instituto de Gestión de la Innovación y del Conocimiento (INGENIO);Universitetet i Oslo,digital skills ;  Eco-innovation ;  green diversification ;  ICTs ;  technological relatedness
"Green process innovation, green product innovation and its economic performance improvement paths: A survey and structural model","Green technology innovation is an important driving force for high-quality development in China. Recently, much attention has focused on the connotation, influencing factors and mode selection of green technology innovation, yet few studies have systematically tested the transmission paths between green technology innovation and economic performance. Green technology innovation can be divided into green process innovation and green product innovation, both of which can improve the environmental and economic performance of enterprises. Drawing on previous research, this study constructs a model of economic performance transmission for green technology innovation and upgrading, and conducts an empirical analysis based on data from 642 industrial enterprises in China. The results show that green process innovation and green product innovation can effectively improve the economic performance of enterprises. The environmental performance and market competitiveness of enterprises are important mediating variables in the paths of economic performance improvement. An enterprise's green process innovation can positively promote green product innovation, and there is also room for technological innovation upgrading. There are two main differences in the transmission paths for different types of green technology innovation: (1) Green process innovation can improve economic performance directly, whereas green product innovation can only do this indirectly; (2) In most cases, the path from green product innovation to economic performance is more important than that from green process innovation to economic performance. This study deepens understanding of the green technology innovation process and has implications for optimizing policy design for green development.",Wang M.; Li Y.; Li J.; Wang Z.,Journal,Journal of Environmental Management,2021-11-01,Institutes of Science and Development;Tongji University;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences,Economic performance ;  Green process innovation ;  Green product innovation ;  Paths of economic performance transmission
"Using health technology assessment to set priority, inform target product profiles, and design clinical study for health innovation","Early health technology assessment (early HTA) is a useful tool in guiding the innovation development process in medical technology development. However, the application of early HTA is sub-optimal amongst research and development (R&D) communities due to several challenges. In this paper, we presented a case study of application of early HTA by drawing on the experience from a workshop conducted for the Singapore government's medical technology innovation agency. The framework developed can help maximise the chance of the newly developed technology being accepted and widely used. By providing step-by-step guidance, this work aims to translate early HTA into a practical tool and promote the application of early HTA amongst R&D communities.",Wang Y.; Rattanavipapong W.; Teerawattananon Y.,Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2021-11-01,National University of Singapore;Thailand Ministry of Public Health,Decision support ;  Early health technology assessment ;  Priority setting ;  Target product profiles ;  Uncertainty
The politics of research and innovation: Understanding instrument choices in complex governance environments – the case of France and Italy,"What governments desire to achieve, and how they want to accomplish their goals, represent the core of any policy design process. However, it is still unclear how partisan politics, in its combined effect with path-dependency forces, influence policy makers’ choices over alternative instrument mixes. Through a comparative analysis of Research and Innovation (R&I) instrument choices in countries characterized by different paradigmatic models of policy (Italy and France), the paper investigates how the politics of different cabinets influence the formulation of national R&I strategies and the extent to which these decisions are constrained by the legacy of previous choices. By capitalizing on a new proposed treatment of policy instruments, the paper contributes to the definition of the types of tools found in policy mixes, investigating how national R&I instrument mix variations develop. The results of the analysis indicate how the selection of R&I policy instruments does not closely follow traditional left versus right-wing political cleavages, and their evolution is generally influenced by a combination of different context-dependent dynamics. However, when partisan acceptance of consolidated R&I instrument mixes across cabinets is present, this triggers a consolidating effect on path-dependency forces.",Acciai C.,Journal,Research Policy,2021-11-01,Københavns Universitet,Instrument mix ;  Politics of instrument choices ;  Qualitative Content Analysis ;  Research & Innovation Policy
Understanding socio-technological challenges of smart classrooms using a systematic review,"Smart classrooms are paradigm innovations for enhanced learning behavior in digital learning environments. These environments offer benefits for inclusive and virtual learning, underscoring the need for assessments of current practices. Although research on smart classrooms propose models and systems for enhancing socio-technological integration, knowledge on socio-technological challenges of smart classrooms remains limited. This article applies a systematic review methodology in line with the PRISMA protocol and analyzes current social and technological challenges based on 105 articles published between 2000 and 2019. The review identifies social challenges that facilitate personalization for external factors and teaching methods, stimulate learner-oriented content, instructor, peer, and technology forms of engagement, and boost interactivity depending on the willingness of learners and instructors. The review also finds technological challenges that concern designing learning environments and integrating intelligent systems, analytical tools and analysis, system models and ontology, and mobile and social media applications. The review suggests areas for future research involving smart classroom design for continuity and consistency, quality attributes of smart classrooms, efficiency and sustainability of smart classroom infrastructure, and the development of a smart classroom modelling language.",Alfoudari A.; Durugbo C.; Aldhmour F.,Journal,Computers and Education,2021-11-01,Arabian Gulf University,Smart classroom ;  Socio-technological challenges ;  Systematic review ;  Technology-supported learning
Are pre-service teachers disinclined to utilise embodied humanoid social robots in the classroom?,"Teachers' readiness for technology integration depends also on their beliefs about the contribution of technology to teaching and learning, which influence their motivation for its adoption. Initial pre-service teacher education is critical in reducing the attitude-behaviour divide supporting technology acceptability, acceptance and use. Acceptance of interaction between human and robot is more complicated than human-computer interaction acceptance. Social robots are radical innovations, harder for potential users to accept in human social spaces than are incremental innovations. In 2019, a survey using a convenience sample of 121 first-year students was conducted to examine pre-service teachers' beliefs about social robot educational technology. It examined the following factors derived from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology adopted for social robots in education: Perceived social dimension, Intention to use, Perceived usability, Anxiety. Based on our findings, it seems there is a critical disjunction between researchers' efforts to equip social robots with human manners and social intelligence and participants' rejection of this technology precisely because it mimics being human. Further, we report that ICT familiarity as assessed using PISA's Information Communication Technology—ICT familiarity factors is related to robot acceptability. These findings need further examination to inform educational robotics design and Human-Robot Interaction research and teacher education and training. Practitioners notes What is already known about this topic In the age of robotic technology, teachers face requirements to prepare students for work and life with social robots. Social robots are tested for classroom integration. Teachers' readiness to implement robot lessons depends on their beliefs about social robotic technology's contribution to teaching. Research and development in the field of social robotics still tend to focus more frequently on technology applications rather than pedagogical issues and advancing teaching and learning. What this paper adds Participants refuse to accept the idea of social robot-based instruction. The identified belief pattern is based mainly on the perceived social dimension, intention to use, perceived usability and anxiety. Participants critically perceive the robot's social dimension. Some of PISA's ICT familiarity factors are related to robots acceptability factors. Implication for policy and/or practice The policy and practice need to address how social robots could be integrated into current teaching and learning practices and more importantly how could robotic technology facilitate innovative pedagogical models for effective and efficient learning. The introduction of social robots should follow instructional design requirements and not merely technological advancement. Teacher initial education has to provide social robotic learning environments for pre-service teachers to experiment and design.",Istenic A.; Bratko I.; Rosanda V.,Journal,British Journal of Educational Technology,2021-11-01,Kazan Federal University;Univerza v Ljubljani;University of Primorska;State High School with Slovenian Teaching Language Ivan Cankar,acceptability ;  embodied humanoid social robots ;  ICT familiarity ;  pre-service teachers

Biosynthetic scaffolds for partial meniscal loss: A systematic review from animal models to clinical practice,"Acute or degenerative meniscus tears are the most common knee lesions. Meniscectomy provides symptomatic relief and functional recovery only in the short- to mid-term follow-up but significantly increases the risk of osteoarthritis. For this reason, preserving the meniscus is key, although it remains a challenge. Allograft transplants present many disadvantages, so during the last 20 years preclinical and clinical research focused on developing and investigating meniscal scaffolds. The aim of this systematic review was to collect and evaluate all the available evidence on biosynthetic scaffolds for meniscus regeneration both in vivo and in clinical studies. Three databases were searched: 46 in vivo preclinical studies and 30 clinical ones were found. Sixteen natural, 15 synthetic, and 15 hybrid scaffolds were studied in vivo. Among them, only 2 were translated into clinic: the Collagen Meniscus Implant, used in 11 studies, and the polyurethane-based scaffold Actifit®, applied in 19 studies. Although positive outcomes were described in the short- to mid-term, the number of concurrent procedures and the lack of randomized trials are the major limitations of the available clinical literature. Few in vivo studies also combined the use of cells or growth factors, but these augmentation strategies have not been applied in the clinical practice yet. Current solutions offer a significant but incomplete clinical improvement, and the regeneration potential is still unsatisfactory. Building upon the overall positive results of these “old” technologies to address partial meniscal loss, further innovation is urgently needed in this field to provide patients better joint sparing treatment options.",Veronesi F.; Di Matteo B.; Vitale N.; Filardo G.; Visani A.; Kon E.; Fini M.,Journal,Bioactive Materials,2021-11-01,"Humanitas University;Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University (RNRMU);Ente Ospedaliero Cantonale;IRCCS Rizzoli Orthopaedic Institute, Bologna;Humanitas Research Hospital;Università della Svizzera italiana",Collagen ;  Meniscal scaffold ;  Meniscectomy ;  Osteoarthritis ;  Polyurethane ;  Regenerative medicine
Price and quality: relationship between bid rate and construction performance rating ranking,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to try to understand the relationship between price and quality in public procurement by using data on the quality of civil engineering works and prices in tenders. By doing so, it tries to conduct a comprehensive examination of the quality of construction works, which has been difficult to recognize and evaluate. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology of this analysis is to collect data on the quality of construction works from the rankings of construction performance evaluations revealed by public procurement authorities. In addition, the prices of bids of the providers in public procurement are also collected from the available data and analyzed. The relationship between the two was statistically analyzed in an objective and verifiable way. Findings: What the study found was that the price of the work measured by the bid rate had a positive and significant relationship with the quality of the work measured by the construction performance rating. Furthermore, the panel data were analyzed using panel data for 51 firms that all appeared in the construction performance evaluation for 12 years and participated in at least three bids in each year, and the first-order term of the bid rate was negative and the second-order term was positive and was 10% significant, which is a U-shaped relationship. Research limitations/implications: This study is one of the investigations focused on public procurement construction work. One of the limitations of this study is that it is a study of one industry in the Asian region. However, this study focuses on the incentives of business operators. As such, the analysis is applicable to all situations faced by those running businesses. Practical implications: The managerial implications of this study include the following: although, improving the quality of construction results is costly, competitive firms are also steadily improving their quality as it is a factor of competition. However, there will come a point where their efforts come to a halt at a certain level. It is necessary to operate the business with this situation in mind. In addition to the company's efforts, it is necessary to lobby the government. Social implications: As a policy implication for this analysis, it was possible to evaluate that steady improvement in construction results was confirmed, but the correlation between the relaxation of the competition and the increase in the bid rate was correlated with the decrease in the total amount of public works. This highlights the problem of having to think about measures for the efficient use of the. In addition to this, the fact that the competition situation has been eased can be considered as a problem that it will adversely affect the innovation stimulation of operators, and that it will become necessary to pay more attention to competition limiting acts. Originality/value: The uniqueness of this paper is firstly that unique data representing the quality of public procurement, which had been difficult to analyze, were collected, organized and used in the study. In addition, not only did we find a positive relationship between quality and price but we also found a U-shaped relationship between them using panel data.",Arai K.,Journal,International Journal of Quality and Reliability Management,2021-11-01,Kyoritsu Women’s University,Construction industry ;  Japan ;  Performance ;  Price and quality ;  Public procurement
Advancing pediatric medical device development via non-dilutive NIH SBIR/STTR grant funding,"Introduction: A shortage of medical devices designed for children persists due to the smaller pediatric population and market factors. Furthermore, pediatric device development is challenging due to the limited available funding sources. We describe our experience with pediatric device projects that successfully received federal grant support towards commercializing the devices that can serve as a guide for future innovators. Methods: The developmental pathways of pediatric device projects at a tertiary-care children's hospital that received NIH SBIR/STTR funding between 2016–2019 were reviewed. The clinical problems, designs, specific aims, and development phase were delineated. Results: Pediatric faculty successfully secured NIH SBIR/STTR funding for five pediatric devices via qualified small business concerns (SBC's). Three projects were initiated in the capstone engineering design programs and developed further at two affiliated engineering schools, while the other two projects were developed in the faculty members’ labs. Four projects received funding via established SBC's, while one was awarded funding via a newly established SBC. Conclusion: NIH SBIR/STTR grants are an essential source of external non-dilutive funding for pediatric device innovation and especially for academic-initiated projects. This funding can provide needed early-stage support to facilitate commercialization. In addition, these grants can serve as achievable accomplishments for pediatric faculty portfolios toward academic promotion. Our experience shows that it is possible to build a robust innovation ecosystem comprised of academic faculty (clinical/engineering) collaborating with local device development companies while jointly implementing a product development strategy leveraging NIH SBIR/STTR funding for critical translational research phases of pediatric device development.",Sun R.; Kamat I.; Byju A.; Wettergreen M.; Heffernan M.; Willson R.; Haridas B.; Koh C.,Journal,Journal of Pediatric Surgery,2021-11-01,Texas A&M University;Texas Children's Hospital;University of Houston;Rice University;Fannin,Biomedical engineering ;  Commercialization ;  Device development ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Federal grant funding ;  Innovation ;  Pediatric device development

Exploring how the intangible side of an organization impacts its business model,"Purpose: Information technology/software (IT/SW) professionals use the business model canvas (BMC) to identify innovative digital solutions that improve their client’s business values. This paper aims to address the issue of considering, for a client company, the status of its intangible assets (IAs) in decision-making on the most innovative digital solution. Design/methodology/approach: This paper provides a method (BMCIA-method) and a simulation tool (BMCIA-NetSim) to help IT/SW professionals identify and assess an organization’s IAs and their impact on the BMC of digital business. Findings: IT/SW professionals used this approach, at 14 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to identify innovative solutions and add digital value to their businesses. They used the BMCIA to provide their clients (SME’s chief executive officer or chief operating officer) with a view of the BMC enhanced with the status of IAs. These expressed interest in the use of the BMCIA and underscore its importance for making better decisions while aligning IT and the business. A survey reveals how well the BMCIA-method performed during its use to discover the best solution to be developed at each SME. Research limitations/implications: IAs affect the achievement of the business goal targeted using the BMC. If these are not identified, valued and properly aligned with the BMC blocks, critical information is hidden from the eyes of IT/SW professionals and their clients, preventing optimal decision-making on which is the best IT/SW solution to be implemented to add digital value to the client company.

A cross-sectional study of the scientific production of doctoral graduates in Peru,"Objective: To determine the scientific production of doctoral graduates in Peru. Methods: We made a descriptive cross-sectional study with a quantitative analysis approach of the scientific production of doctoral graduates in all areas of science registered in the National Council of Science, Technology and Technological Innovation of Peru. Results: We analyzed the scientific production of 942 doctoral graduates with a median time since the graduation of 84 months (interquartile range: 36 to 132). In total, 532 (56.48%) had published an article in their lifetime. The median of published articles was four (interquartile range: 2 to 12), and the median H-index of the doctoral graduates who had published was two (interquartile range: 1 to 5). We found that the number of publications and H-index was statistically different according to the doctorate area of science (p < 0.05 for both). Natural Sciences (69.13%), Engineering (67.47%), and Health Sciences (67.08%) had the highest proportion of doctoral graduates with at least one publication.

Randomized Evaluation of Reading Skills: An Opportunity for Systematic Literature Review,"In the context of public policies, randomized evaluation of the impact of public programs and policies is fundamental because it provides the most credible and reliable way to learn what works and what does not in education to reduce poverty and improve the well-being of individuals and society. There is an urgency in the literature emerging during the pandemic to develop each student's reading skills since there is no development without literacy. For this reason, research studies report randomized control trials (RCT) for comprehensive reading programs that are of great interest to the educational system. This article aims to analyze the characteristics of these studies and the trends of new contributions to education. To achieve this, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of 63 articles published between January 2015 and January 2019 in the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases. We explored three themes using seven questions. The themes were a) Impact evaluation and randomized control trial (RCT), its approach and criteria; b) innovation and technology in reading programs; and c) the use of technology in the social appropriation of knowledge. The findings showed an increase in randomized control trials in impact evaluation, the need to optimize the quality of these studies, and the challenge of integrating innovation and technology in reading programs. We concluded that increasing and optimizing the impact evaluation approach in these topic research contributes in a substantive way to researchers and government decision making and to advance in the path of achieving a fair, equitable and quality education for all.",Honorato-Errazuriz J.; Ramirez-Montoya M.,Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2021-10-26,Tecnológico de Monterrey;Ministerio de Educación,Higher education ;  Innovative education ;  Primary education ;  Public policy ;  Randomized Control Trial ;  Reading skills ;  Systematic literature review

Fostering design thinking in transdisciplinary engineering education,"Disruptive technologies such as 3D printing, artificial intelligence (AI), and robotics have changed how people think, learn, and work fundamentally. Engineering education must adapt to this digital transformation. There has been increasing interest in integrating design in the engineering curriculum around the world. While traditional problem solving is a linear and structured approach, design thinking is set by a human-centered innovation process which leads to better products and services. This concept is well aligned with the educational vision of transdisciplinary engineering. However, it is challenging to teach the mindset of design thinking for people with various domain knowledge. In this paper, the differences in how industrial designers and design engineers tackle a design project are explained. We intend to share a few successful examples regarding how design methodology captures customer requirements and explores creative solutions in the product development lifecycle within the current engineering curriculum. Also, the user experience research in response to the trend of cyberphysical integration is discussed. Finally, we conclude with the need for a holistic curriculum design in digital manufacturing as a case study to illustrate the role of design thinking for future transdisciplinary engineering education.",Kuo J.; Song X.; Chen C.; Patel C.,Conference Proceeding,Advances in Transdisciplinary Engineering,2021-10-20,School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering;Hewlett Packard Laboratories,3D printing ;  Design methodology ;  Design thinking ;  Digital manufacturing ;  Engineering education ;  Transdisciplinary

Invest in Innovation or Not? How Managerial Cognition and Attention Allocation Shape Corporate Responses to Performance Shortfalls,"This study investigates the influence of managerial cognition and attention allocation on firms' responses to negative performance feedback. We explore how managerial cognition, as shaped by managers' experiences, connections, positions, and industry environments, affects underperforming firms' attention allocation and, consequently, their decisions to invest in innovation. Utilizing a longitudinal sample of Chinese high-tech firms from 2009 to 2017, we find that firms increase investment in research and development (R&D) when performance falls below aspiration levels. We also document that underperforming firms are associated with an even larger R&D investment increase when their CEOs have an R&D or engineering background, serve simultaneously as the board chair, or are not politically connected. In addition, we highlight the moderating effects of industry competition and industry norms on the relationship between firm underperformance and R&D intensity. We conclude that managerial cognition affects firms' allocation of attention to innovation as a solution for closing performance gaps and shapes corporate responses to negative performance feedback.",He L.; Huang L.; Yang G.,Journal,Management and Organization Review,2021-10-20,Minjiang University;Wuyi University;Fuzhou University;SUNY Brockport,attention-based view ;  innovation ;  managerial cognition ;  performance feedback theory ;  R&D

A Human-Centered Systematic Literature Review of Cyberbullying Detection Algorithms,"Cyberbullying is a growing problem across social media platforms, inflicting short and long-lasting effects on victims. To mitigate this problem, research has looked into building automated systems, powered by machine learning, to detect cyberbullying incidents, or the involved actors like victims and perpetrators. In the past, systematic reviews have examined the approaches within this growing body of work, but with a focus on the computational aspects of the technical innovation, feature engineering, or performance optimization, without centering around the roles, beliefs, desires, or expectations of humans. In this paper, we present a human-centered systematic literature review of the past 10 years of research on automated cyberbullying detection. We analyzed 56 papers based on a three-prong human-centeredness algorithm design framework - spanning theoretical, participatory, and speculative design. We found that the past literature fell short of incorporating human-centeredness across multiple aspects, ranging from defining cyberbullying, establishing the ground truth in data annotation, evaluating the performance of the detection models, to speculating the usage and users of the models, including potential harms and negative consequences. Given the sensitivities of the cyberbullying experience and the deep ramifications cyberbullying incidents bear on the involved actors, we discuss takeaways on how incorporating human-centeredness in future research can aid with developing detection systems that are more practical, useful, and tuned to the diverse needs and contexts of the stakeholders.",Kim S.; Razi A.; Stringhini G.; Wisniewski P.; De Choudhury M.,Journal,Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction,2021-10-18,University of Central Florida;Boston University;Georgia Institute of Technology,cyberbullying detection ;  human-centered machine learning ;  literature review ;  social media

Modeling the effect of green technology innovation and renewable energy on carbon neutrality in N-11 countries? Evidence from advance panel estimations,"After the Paris Climate Conference (Conference of the Paris COP: 21), most developing countries face challenges to attain a sustainable economy and carbon neutrality targets with minimum CO2 emission. The next eleven (N-11) economies are in line with the global phenomena of environmental degradation; very few studies have analyzed the effects of green technology innovation on environmental degradation in N-11 countries. Therefore, the present study addresses the gap and examines green technology innovation and renewable energy with CO2 emission from 1980 to 2018. The present study considers all the issues related to panel data analysis, such as cross-sectional dependence, stationarity, heterogeneity in slope parameters, and structural break with advanced panel estimators. Moreover, the cross-sectional augmented autoregressive distributed lags (CS-ARDL) test results show the negative and significant impact of green technology innovation and renewable energy with CO2 emission in the long run. However, the short-run association of green technology innovation is not significant—further, the results endorsed by the robustness tests such as AMG and CCEMG.

Engineering of nanomaterials for mass spectrometry analysis of biomolecules,"Mass spectrometry (MS) based analysis has received intense attention in diverse biological fields. However, direct MS interrogation of target biomolecules in complex biological samples is still challenging, due to the extremely low abundance and poor ionization potency of target biological species. Innovations in nanomaterials create new auxiliary tools for deep and comprehensive MS characterization of biomolecules. More recently, growing research interest has been directed to the compositional and structural engineering of nanomaterials for enriching target biomolecules prior to MS analysis, enhancing the ionization efficiency in MS detection and designing biosensing nanoprobes in sensitive MS readout. In this review, we mainly focus on the recent advances in the engineering of nanomaterials towards their applications in sample pre-treatment, desorption/ionization matrices and ion signal amplification for MS profiling of biomolecules. This review will provide a toolbox of nanomaterials for researchers devoted to developing analytical methods and practical applications in the biological MS field.

Challenges and novel approaches for the development of hardware-related trustworthy electronics,"Emerging and future electronic components and systems must not only meet cost, performance, reliability, miniaturization and environmental requirements, they must also be trustworthy. In the near future, we have to trust even more electronic components and systems in everyday life, such as those used in self-driving cars or service robots. In this contribution, we present the challenges and novel approaches for the development of hardware-related trustworthy electronics. Our proposed solutions cover all aspects of the value chain starting with the confidentiality of secure production chains, the security against manipulation as well as technological sovereignty. These novel approaches are extensively investigated with partners from academia and industry in R&D projects within the framework of the German Flagship initiative ""Trustworthy Electronics"". The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) as a contribution to research and innovation for technological sovereignty fund this initiative. In this paper, we will report on the latest research results of the implementation of our approaches at four key levels, namely wafer, board, system and platform levels. In the area of wafer level packaging, the focus is on developing solutions for the implementation of trustworthy heterogeneous systems using high-frequency chips in combination with complex signal processing. At board-level, the goal is to develop a universal electro-optical interposer, particularly taking into account security features (e.g. key generation and encryption/decryption, design of photonic expandable RISC-V peripheral components). At system-level, we focus on the development of processes and multi-sensor systems that protect important microelectronic circuits from criminal attacks. The entire system has to be protected by hierarchically graded monitoring, by embedded sensors and its corresponding microcontrollers. The development of the packaging and interconnection technology is supplemented by non-destructive testing methods that monitor the integrity of the protective mechanisms. The approach pursued here does not require any modification of the structure of the circuits to be protected and can be combined with all safety-critical application circuits. With this cost-effective solution, small series production is also economically feasible. Finally, at the platform-level, overreaching issues are investigated within the three pillars, namely design, production and analysis of the microelectronic value chain. The platform concentrates predominantly on contributions to the necessary standardization. This enables companies effectively to support the supply of trustworthy electronics, especially with regard to small series.",Middendorf A.; Böttcher M.; Jung E.; Pötter H.; Ndip I.; Töpper M.; Schneider-Ramelow M.; Steller W.,Journal,Advancing Microelectronics,2021-10-01,Fraunhofer Institute for Reliability and Microintegration IZM,Chiplet ;  embedded hardware ;  hardware-safety ;  hardware-security ;  reliability ;  trustworthy electronics

Complex geological conditions, as well as high ground stress, high ground temperature, high gas content, high water pressure, and other harsh operating conditions, are inevitably encountered during construction and efforts have been made to solve the problems of great construction difficulties, low efficiency, and frequent accidents. Based on the current situation of underground space development technology and equipment in China, the problems faced in this field are summarized. The development direction of tunnel and underground engineering construction and equipment in China is proposed. In order to cope with these problems, relevant suggestions are put forward: issue some policy documents on the demonstration and application of new tunnel construction equipment to promote technological innovation; rationally develop and utilize underground space, promote green construction and contribute to the carbon peak and neutrality target; develop intelligent technology for shield machines, so as to realize green operation and less manned or manless operation; accelerate the research on key technologies and major equipment to solve the bottleneck problems, developing new construction method and equipment for tunnel construction under complex geological environment and extreme working conditions, key technologies and major equipment for urban underground engineering.",Li Z.; Jiang Y.; Jiang L.; Huang W.; Shu L.; Mei Y.; Li J.,Journal,Tunnel Construction,2021-10-01,China Academy of Engineering Physics;Huazhong University of Science and Technology;China Railway Group Limited;China Railway Construction;Shenzhen University,construction equipment ;  construction technology ;  green construction ;  intellectual technology ;  tunnel ;  urban underground project
Practices for Implementing Interactive Teaching Development Groups,"This paper reports on a two-year project to form teaching development groups in engineering departments. The goal of each group was to discuss and implement interactive teaching strategies (e.g., in-class problem solving). The research design used meetings notes, feedback from group leaders and a case study of one participant to describe how the groups can be designed to support teaching development. This research was grounded in the following questions: What are the design principles underlying a successful, ongoing, small-group model for faculty teaching development? What logistical and structural features are important for ongoing faculty teaching development in a small-group format? This paper presents the five principles identified in the study and provides a case study of an engineering faculty member’s teaching innovations over the several years during and after his participation in the faculty development group.",Hjalmarson M.; Nelson J.; Huettel L.; Wage K.; Buck J.; Padgett W.,Journal,Advances in Engineering Education,2021-10-01,Rose Hulman Institute Technology;George Mason University;University of Massachusetts Dartmouth;Duke University,Faculty development ;  Interactive teaching ;  Learning communities
State-of-The-Art: Biodesign based Innovation Ecosystems in Europe,"Today's healthcare challenges with unmet clinical needs, high regulation and certification standards, and increasing costs demand faster innovation and technical translation. To address this challenge, Stanford released a fellowship called Biodesign, where need-based healthcare innovation is taught with the approach identify, invent and implement. Since then, different European institutions have adopted the Biodesign innovation approach and organized within the Biomedical Engineering-Innovation, Design, and Entrepreneurship Alliance (BMEidea EU). The generation of successful healthcare innovation isn't only based on participating in an Innovation teaching program. It is much more a matter of having the right innovation ecosystem with an open creative mindset, experts, the respective stakeholders, and access to essential resources within reach (close to clinic). Through a qualitative survey, seven Biodesign based teaching programs in the EU were examined. The study from an academic perspective contains information covering Resources, Activities, Academic Performance, and Transfer Performance. The demand for new healthcare innovations, and especially innovation training programs that address challenges, developed collaboratively with the respective stakeholders, is increasing. Additionally, there is a growing expectation that innovation needs to reach the market quickly and be implemented accordingly.

Illness duration and symptom profile in symptomatic UK school-aged children tested for SARS-CoV-2,"Background: In children, SARS-CoV-2 infection is usually asymptomatic or causes a mild illness of short duration. Persistent illness has been reported; however, its prevalence and characteristics are unclear. We aimed to determine illness duration and characteristics in symptomatic UK school-aged children tested for SARS-CoV-2 using data from the COVID Symptom Study, one of the largest UK citizen participatory epidemiological studies to date. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, data from UK school-aged children (age 5–17 years) were reported by an adult proxy. Participants were voluntary, and used a mobile application (app) launched jointly by Zoe Limited and King's College London. Illness duration and symptom prevalence, duration, and burden were analysed for children testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 for whom illness duration could be determined, and were assessed overall and for younger (age 5–11 years) and older (age 12–17 years) groups. Children with longer than 1 week between symptomatic reports on the app were excluded from analysis. Data from symptomatic children testing negative for SARS-CoV-2, matched 1:1 for age, gender, and week of testing, were also assessed. Findings: 258 790 children aged 5–17 years were reported by an adult proxy between March 24, 2020, and Feb 22, 2021, of whom 75 529 had valid test results for SARS-CoV-2. 1734 children (588 younger and 1146 older children) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result and calculable illness duration within the study timeframe (illness onset between Sept 1, 2020, and Jan 24, 2021). The most common symptoms were headache (1079 [62·2%] of 1734 children), and fatigue (954 [55·0%] of 1734 children). Median illness duration was 6 days (IQR 3–11) versus 3 days (2–7) in children testing negative, and was positively associated with age (Spearman's rank-order rs 0·19, p<0·0001). Median illness duration was longer for older children (7 days, IQR 3–12) than younger children (5 days, 2–9). 77 (4·4%) of 1734 children had illness duration of at least 28 days, more commonly in older than younger children (59 [5·1%] of 1146 older children vs 18 [3·1%] of 588 younger children; p=0·046). The commonest symptoms experienced by these children during the first 4 weeks of illness were fatigue (65 [84·4%] of 77), headache (60 [77·9%] of 77), and anosmia (60 [77·9%] of 77); however, after day 28 the symptom burden was low (median 2 symptoms, IQR 1–4) compared with the first week of illness (median 6 symptoms, 4–8). Only 25 (1·8%) of 1379 children experienced symptoms for at least 56 days. Few children (15 children, 0·9%) in the negatively tested cohort had symptoms for at least 28 days; however, these children experienced greater symptom burden throughout their illness (9 symptoms, IQR 7·7–11·0 vs 8, 6–9) and after day 28 (5 symptoms, IQR 1·5–6·5 vs 2, 1–4) than did children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Interpretation: Although COVID-19 in children is usually of short duration with low symptom burden, some children with COVID-19 experience prolonged illness duration. Reassuringly, symptom burden in these children did not increase with time, and most recovered by day 56. Some children who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 also had persistent and burdensome illness. A holistic approach for all children with persistent illness during the pandemic is appropriate.

Key enablers and barriers of solar paver technologies for the advancement of environmental sustainability,"Global initiatives to improve environmental sustainability have centered on reducing energy consumption and developing technological solutions for greener power generation. Current insights on innovations for environmental sustainability are primarily from developed countries, with limited studies originating from developing countries. This study focuses on solar paver technology, a potential innovation for sustainable generation of power. The interest in this technology lies in its dual-purpose ability to enable both functional road surfaces and the use of solar roadways that can generate electricity to power other road infrastructure such as electric lights. To maximize the potential of success of deployment of solar pavers, it is important to investigate the practicalities of solar pavers and understand the perceptions of stakeholders that will be responsible for the implementation of solar pavers. This research addresses this gap in knowledge. Thirty construction industry stakeholders in Malaysia were interviewed through focus group discussions and interviews. This study applied the diffusion of innovation theory to develop an understanding of the nuances of solar pavers. The findings identified three superordinate categories (motivation, opportunity, and ability) and nine categories (compliance with green initiatives, promote corporate social responsibility, dual functionality, financial incentives, sunny climate, increased environmental awareness, green experience, experts network and familiarity with solar technology) as the key enablers. Key barriers constitute two superordinate categories (challenges and weaknesses) and ten categories (reluctant authority, vandalism, complexity of installation and maintenance, high humidity and rainfall, negative environmental impact, high cost, design flaws, low efficiency, questionable practicality, and better comparative opportunities). There is an acceptance of solar pavers by the stakeholders and cost and ownership structures are the key to the deployment. The findings provide fresh insights into a new form of sustainable solar paver engendering new streams of research in construction engineering and technology management. Implications for management and organizational research are discussed.",Teh P.; Adebanjo D.; Kong D.,Journal,Heliyon,2021-10-01,University of Greenwich Business School;Monash University Malaysia,Qualitative study ;  Solar paver ;  Sustainable technology
A review of the research on the mechanism of hydro-shearing in geothermal reservoir,"In the enhanced geothermal system (EGS), a low-pressure water injection trigged rock fracture shear is a key technique to enhance the fluid conductivity and improve the heat extraction efficiency of geo-thermal reservoir. However, the mechanism of hydro-shearing under hydro-thermo-mechanical-chemical (HTMC) coupled conditions is extremely complex which has become a key issue for heat extraction and a hot topic for earthquake prevention and control in EGS. Furthermore, lots of new problems arise and many existing theories are no longer fully applicable under high temperature and high pressure (HTHP).This in turn requires that the theoretical innovation, experimental equipment development and engineering technique breakthroughs should be made to promote the progress of geothermal energy development. By reviewing the current research status of hydro-shearing mechanism, the authors focused on the topic of hydro-shearing mechanism of fractured rock mass under HTMC coupling and clarified some key scientific and technical problems including:① evolutions of the cohesive strength and internal friction under high temperatures; ② HTMC coupled effect on hydro-shearing criteria; ③ applicability and parameter optimization of effective stress theory; ④ dynamic failure response of hot-dry-rock fractures under hydro-shearing; ⑤ effect of thermal shock on hydro-shearing; and ⑥ the relationship between water injecting induced shearing and the possibility of induced earthquake, and potentials about releasing earthquake using hydro-shearing technique. By re-viewing the mechanism of hydro-shearing of the EGS reservoir, the authors would like to summarize and discuss the key scientific and technical problems, thus it may be helpful to have a comprehensive understanding of hydro-shearing and promote the application of the technique.",Zhang H.; Wan Z.; Zhao Y.; Zhang Y.; Lu S.,Journal,Meitan Xuebao/Journal of the China Coal Society,2021-10-01,"China University of Mining & Technology, Beijing;China University of Mining and Technology;Anhui University of Science and Technology",Dry hot rock ;  Enhanced geothermal system ;  Failure mechanism ;  Hydro-shearing ;  Mechanism of hydro-shearing
Responsible innovation of nano-agrifoods: Insights and views from U.S. stakeholders,"To date, there has been little published work that has elicited diverse stakeholder views of nano-agrifoods and of how nano-agrifoods align with the goals of responsible innovation. This paper aims to fill this research gap by investigating views of nano-agrifoods, how well their development adheres to principles of responsible innovation, and potential challenges for achieving responsible nano-agrifood innovation. Using an online engagement platform, we find that U.S. stakeholder views of responsible innovation were dominated by environmental, health, and safety (EHS) contexts, considerations of societal impacts, opportunities for stakeholder engagement, and responding to societal needs. These views overlap with scholarly definitions of responsible innovation, albeit stakeholders were more focused on impacts of products, while the field of responsible innovation strives for more “upstream” considerations of the process of innovation. We also find that views of nano-agrifoods differed across applications with dietary supplements and improved whitening of infant formula viewed least favorably, and environmental health or food safety applications viewed most favorably. These findings align with the larger body of literature, whereby stakeholders are expected to be more supportive of nanotechnology used in agricultural applications compared to directly within food and food supplements. Overall, participants indicated they held relatively neutral views on research and innovation for nano-agrifoods being conducted responsibly, and they identified key challenges to ensuring their responsible innovation that were related to uncertainties in EHS studies, the need for public understanding and acceptance, and adequate regulation. In light of these results, we recommend future research efforts on EHS impacts and risk-benefit frameworks for nano-agrifoods, better understanding stakeholder views on what constitutes effective regulation, and addressing challenges with effective regulation and responsible innovation practices.",Grieger K.; Merck A.; Cuchiara M.; Binder A.; Kokotovich A.; Cummings C.; Kuzma J.,Journal,NanoImpact,2021-10-01,NC State College of Engineering;NC State University;Iowa State University,Food and agriculture ;  Nanotechnology ;  Responsible innovation ;  Stakeholder engagement
Research on the trend of technological convergence of blockchain based on patents,"The cross-border and convergence of technology and industry has become a new trend. The distributed data governance architecture of blockchain technology provides a new idea for multi-technology deep joint to empower industry development, and grasps the technology convergence structure and development trend of blockchain industry. It is particularly important to identify opportunities for technological development. Based on patent data analysis and combined with the ISI-OST-INPI classification system, this article explores the global blockchain technology convergence situation from four levels and perspectives: the structure of technology convergence, co-occurrence matrix, correlation, and dynamic evolution trend. The study finds that: (1) The core technology of blockchain is three major technologies of information technology management methods, computer technology, and digital communication in the electrical engineering department, with a high degree of convergence and concentration; (2) It is obvious that three core technologies have more convergence with other technologies; (3) The technology convergence index is maintained at a low level, and the convergence between blockchain technologies presents an unbalanced distribution feature.",Li Y.; Zheng J.; Li Z.,Journal,Gaojishu Tongxin/Chinese High Technology Letters,2021-10-01,Institute of Scientific and Technical Information of China,Blockchain ;  ISI-OST-INPI ;  Technological convergence ;  Technological innovation
Gamification as a strategy to increase motivation and engagement in higher education chemistry students,"In the last year, educational experiences have become increasingly challenging due to teaching classes remotely. For this reason, it has been necessary to develop educational strategies that accompany the use of new technologies to maintain student interest. One of these methodologies is gamification, implemented in school environments more frequently due to the pandemic and whose impact on student motivation and engagement needs to be explored. The literature shows that student participation in these contexts should be increased when applying this methodology, where teachers can also provide greater support. This research proposes improving these aspects by developing a gamification strategy that can be easily replicated in other environments. This study was carried out for a chemistry course at a university in central Mexico. This proposal details the short-, medium-, and long-term bonuses which stimulated and motivated students and achieved specific objectives. We also present the quantitative results of a questionnaire applied to 48 engineering students to identify their perceptions of how gamification could increase motivation and engagement in learning the subject of chemistry. In addition, pre-and post-knowledge tests were applied to determine whether there were changes in the learning outcomes. The results indicated that gamification increased student motivation and engagement, improved attitudes, promoted actions such as keeping the camera on during lectures and regular attendance, and improved student grades. This study fills the need for planning strategies to help improve student motivation in online classes and proposes an instrument to measure the results. It can be helpful to those interested in applying or adapting it in other disciplines.",Chans G.; Portuguez Castro M.,Journal,Computers,2021-10-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Educational innovation ;  Engagement ;  Gamification ;  Higher education ;  Motivation ;  Professional education
Architecture and Key Technologies for New Generation of Waterborne Transportation System,"This article reviews the research progress and engineering practice in green and intelligent waterborne transportation in recent years, including the latest research results in transportation equipment, infrastructure, and operation services, along with the application of green and intelligent technology. The existing problems and technical bottlenecks in current developments are analyzed. Facing the future development needs and challenges, this study proposes the definition of the new generation of waterborne transportation system, which is featured as green, intelligent, and resilient. Through analyzing the basic connotation of the new generation of waterborne transportation system, the study also summarizes the architecture of the waterborne system. On the basis of the cyber-physical system theory, the hierarchical structure is divided into elemental unit level, functional system level, and architecture system level. The core components of the system are green intelligent ships, digital ecological infrastructures, reliable shore based support facilities, and resilient operation services within an integral framework. With the analysis of basic service topology and logic of the system, the ""ship-port-cargo"" and ""man-system-environment"" modes are analyzed from the physical and information aspects. The future transport organizational operation paradigm of ships is described as ""shore-based control"", supplemented by ""ship-based monitoring and watch-keeping"". The new pattern of waterborne transportation has been clearly defined with key technologies as the planning programming of systems, green intelligent waterborne transportation equipment, digital ecological infrastructures, construction and conservation techniques, intelligent control of ships, transport operation and organization, waterborne emergency rescue, and system testing and verification. The study proposes a transformative direction of waterborne transportation in the future, which provides effective support for the high cooperation among, humans in the loop, ship- based systems, shore- based stations, and cloud servers, which realizes the information interconnection, system co-construction, and systematic innovation and promotes a high-quality development of waterborne transportation. The research results can effectively guide the planning, design, construction, and application of the new generation of the waterborne transportation system, supporting the independent development and standardization of future waterway transportation.",Yan X.; Li C.; Liu J.; You X.; Wang S.; Ma F.,Journal,Jiaotong Yunshu Xitong Gongcheng Yu Xinxi/Journal of Transportation Systems Engineering and Information Technology,2021-10-01,Wuhan University of Technology;National Engineering Research Center for Water Transport Safety,Cyber-physical system ;  New generation of waterborne transportation system ;  Shore-based control ;  System architecture ;  Waterborne transportation
Operations and Improvement Needs in the Informal Charcoal Sector: A Participatory Value Stream Analysis,"HIGHLIGHTS Charcoal value chains in two Kenyan counties were anayzed to identify sustainability improvement opportunities. Charcoal value chain actors need specific inputs, skills and face different operational challenges. The trade is conducted in the informal sector, which increases the actors' vulnerability. Improvement needs include sustainable forest management, improved operations, business skills, and coherent policies. SUMMARY Developing profitable and sustainable charcoal supply chains in Sub-Saharan Africa requires good knowledge about their properties, input needs and impacts. Charcoal supply chains in Taita Taveta and Kwale counties, Kenya, were analysed to identify operational and sustainability improvement opportunities. Using operations management, lean engineering and participatory research, charcoal value streams' processes, resources, and outcomes were analysed. Charcoal production and trade have low entry barriers, slow-paced innovation, and thin profit margins for value chain actors. Production is labour intensive, and the actors need specific skills, knowhow, and resources for proper business performance. The value chain's profitability and sustainability can be improved by regenerating exploited quality tree species, improving operation efficiency and safety, promoting market development, and appropriate policies on charcoal production and trade. The study's findings can guide the development of enabling policies and regulatory frameworks for the charcoal industry and improve the actors' performance in the charcoal value chain. .",Roos A.; Mutta D.; Larwanou M.; Wekesa C.; Kowero G.,Journal,International Forestry Review,2021-10-01,Université Abdou Moumouni;Kenya Forestry Research Institute;Sveriges lantbruksuniversitet;African Forest Forum,bioenergy ;  energy policy ;  lean ;  supply chain management ;  sustainable livelihoods framework
In-situ and predicted performance of a certified industrial passive house building under future climate scenarios,"The Wood Innovation Research Lab was designed as a low energy-use building to facilitate the construction and testing of engineered wood products by the faculty and staff of the Master of Engineering in Integrated Wood Design Program at the University of Northern British Columbia in Prince George, BC, Canada. Constructed using a 533 mm thick-wall and 659 mm flat roof assembly, it received certification as Canada’s first industrial facility built to the International Passive House standard. Temperature and humidity sensors were installed in the north and south exterior wall assemblies to measure long-term hygrothermal performance. Data collected between 2018–2020 shows no record of long-term moisture accumulation within the exterior assemblies. Data collected during this time period was used to validate hygrothermal performance models for the building created using the WUFI® Plus software. Long-term performance models created using future climate data for five cities across Canada under two global warming scenarios shows favorable results, with an increase in average annual temperatures resulting in lower average relative humidity values at the interior face of the exterior sheathing board in the exterior wall assemblies.",Conroy A.; Mukhopadhyaya P.; Wimmers G.,Journal,Buildings,2021-10-01,University of Northern British Columbia;University of Victoria,Climate change ;  Climate modeling ;  Durability ;  Hygrothermal behavior ;  Passive house ;  WUFI
EXPLORATORY and EXPLOITATIVE PROJECT MANAGEMENT: HOW PRODUCT and ENGINEERING MANAGERS' PERCEPTIONS DIFFER: A CASE of TWO LARGE HIGH-TECH CORPORATIONS,"Ambidexterity has been a focus for many researchers in the past few decades, and multiple angles of ambidexterity have been studied to understand how to achieve it, its antecedents, and its impact on organisations. While personal ambidexterity has been studied with respect to the tensions the individuals might experience as they juggle exploratory and exploitative innovation projects, little is known about their individual sensemaking prior to their exercise of ambidexterity. This paper aims at narrowing this gap in the literature by offering an insight, based on personal construct theory, as to why managers from product management and engineering management functions in software organisations may not be applying exploratory techniques on exploratory innovation projects. A key finding from this research indicates that managers do not differentiate between types of project in a sufficiently explicit and propositional manner, and as a result, do not choose techniques appropriate to the situation. Instead, they tend to apply exploitative techniques on exploratory innovation projects with slight variations. Recommendations to practitioners to address the issues uncovered are proposed.",Yamnitsky E.; Jankowicz D.,Journal,International Journal of Innovation Management,2021-10-01,"Edinburgh Business School, Heriot-Watt University;NC State University",Ambidexterity ;  Managerial sensemaking ;  Personal construct theory ;  Product management ;  Project management
Green smart campus monitoring and detection using LoRa,"Along with the rapid development of sensing systems and wireless transmission technology, the scope of application of the IoT has substantially increased, and research and innovation that integrate artificial intelligence. This study integrated civil engineering and electrical engineering to establish a universal and modularized long-term sensing system. Aiming at positive construction in civil engineering, the campus of National Taipei University of Technology was used as the experimental site as a green campus. This paper focused on the cooling effect of the green roof and the temperature difference of the solar panel to effectively isolate the direct sunlight on the roof of the building. To achieve long-term monitoring, energy consumption must be minimized. Considering that the distance between sensor nodes in the experimental site was over dozens of feet, LoRa transmission technology was selected for data transmission. LoRa only consumes a small amount of energy during data transmission, and it can freely switch between work modes, achieving optimal power utilization efficiency. The greening-related research results indicated that the shade from solar panels on the rooftop could effectively reduce the temperature increase caused by direct sunlight on concrete surfaces. The temperature reduction effect was positively correlated with whether the solar panels provided shade. After 1 week of monitoring, we observed that having plants on the rooftop for greening negatively correlated with temperature reduction efficiency. Permeable pavement on the ground was positively correlated with temperature reduction efficiency. However, its temperature reduction efficiency was inferior to that of solar panel shading. The temperature difference between high-rise buildings and the ground was approximately 1–2 °C. At the same elevation, the temperature difference between buildings with and without greening was approximately 0.8 °C. Regarding the sensing system designed for this site, both hardware and software could be flexibly set according to the research purposes, precision requirements of the sites, and the measurement scope, thereby enabling their application in more fields.",Tseng K.; Chung M.; Chen L.; Chang P.,Journal,Sensors,2021-10-01,National Taipei University of Technology;Advantech,Internet of Things ;  LoRa ;  Monitoring system ;  Sensor ;  Wireless communication
An injectable bioink with rapid prototyping in the air and in-situ mild polymerization for 3D bioprinting,"Bioprinting is an attractive technology for building tissues from scratch to explore entire new cell configurations, which brings numerous opportunities for biochemical research such as engineering tissues for therapeutic tissue repair or drug screening. However, bioprinting is faced with the limited number of suitable bioinks that enable bioprinting with excellent printability, high structural fidelity, physiological stability, and good biocompatibility, particularly in the case of extrusion-based bioprinting. Herein, we demonstrate a composite bioink based on gelatin, bacterial cellulose (BC), and microbial transglutaminase (mTG enzyme) with outstanding printing controllability and durable architectural integrity. BC, as a rheology modifier and mechanical enhancer component, endows the bioink with shear-thinning behavior. Moreover, the printed structure becomes robust under physiological conditions owing to the in situ chemical crosslinking catalyzed by mTG enzyme. Lattice, bowl, meniscus, and ear structures are printed to demonstrate the printing feasibility of such a composite bioink. Furthermore, the 3D-printed cell-laden constructs are proved to be a conducive biochemical environment that supports growth and proliferation of the encapsulated cells in vitro. In addition, the in vivo studies convince that the composite bioink possesses excellent biocompatibility and biodegradation. It is believed that the innovation of this new composite bioink will push forward the bioprinting technology onto a new stage.",Zhou Y.; Liao S.; Chu Y.; Yuan B.; Tao X.; Hu X.; Wang Y.,Journal,Biofabrication,2021-10-01,Beijing Jishuitan Hospital;Renmin University of China,3D bioprinting ;  bioink ;  enzymatic catalysis ;  gelatin ;  shear-thinning
School culture and digital technologies: Educational practices at universities within the context of the covid-19 pandemic,"The pandemic caused by COVID-19 led schools to continue their work by relying on digital technologies. Changes in this matter are observed within three dimensions in the theoretical and conceptual background:(a) the influence of ITC in education, (b) the macrosocial changes in the educational systems and public policy derived from the COVID-19 pandemic, and (c) the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in higher education and its role for the future. The general objective of this research was to characterize the educational practices executed by the university community (stu-dents, professors, and managers) during the emerging remote classes derived from the pandemic at the Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana, Cuajimalpa Campus, a public educational institution in Mexico (through an explanation for each educational actor profile). As specific research objectives, this paper: (a) examines whether the professors and students had enough digital technology to continue with the classes, (b) defines the obstacles they had in the use of said digital technology, and (c) recognizes the existence of innovative educational practices and determines whether stated learning was achieved in educational programs. For this purpose, a mixed methodology was cho-sen, comprising the application of surveys to students and professors and semi-structured inter-views with managers, professors, and students. It was found that there was innovation in the area of resources (material–economic dimension) and in the area of relationships (socio-political dimen-sion), while the discursive dimension (cultural-discursive dimension) was negatively impacted. Based on the above, we conclude that the school culture of the UAM-C is solid and that it has the necessary technological resources to continue with the teaching–learning process. The educational practice was transformed, which resulted in advantages and disadvantages, but despite these situ-ations, most students developed their learning.",González-Nieto N.; García-Hernández C.; Espinosa-Meneses M.,Journal,Future Internet,2021-10-01,Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana Unidad Cuajimalpa,COVID-19 ;  Digital technology ;  Educational innovation ;  Educational practices ;  Higher education ;  School culture
Why gender is relevant to materials science and engineering,"For historical reasons science today has substantially more evidence for males and men than for females and women, which means that quality of research and innovation outcomes may often be worse for women than for men. I explore how the gender dimension—a term used to mean effects of biological (sex) and/or socio-cultural (gender) characteristics—fits into new materials research and engineering and especially in nano-materials applications. Horizon Europe expects that grant proposals should include explanation if gender dimension is relevant to the project’s objectives. This paper shows that often the answer should be yes it is.",Pollitzer E.,Journal,MRS Communications,2021-10-01,Portia,Bioelectronics ;  Biological ;  Biomaterial ;  Biomedical ;  Environmental impact
Making Waves: Joining forces for better doctoral education in water research,"We argue that doctoral education in water needs an elevated focus towards educating game changers who can drive innovation and change towards more sustainable futures across academic and non-academic settings. Today's doctoral graduates in water are increasingly employed outside academia, and challenged to understand complex and interconnected systems, to integrate and synthesize information from different disciplines and to lead the way toward increasingly creative, resilient, robust, and socially sustainable solutions. Supervisors are challenged by interdisciplinary research topics and by growing diversity of objectives, too often at the cost of their wellbeing. The need to keep up with the rapid scientific and technological development and floods of big data is pressing. We synthesize key insights from higher education literature and doctoral programs in water research to identify priority actions targeted at four key actor groups: supervisors and supervisees, research group, university, and industry. The actions contribute to appropriate resourcing, enabling an environment for enhanced teamwork practices, and systematic structures for progress. Establishing supporting structures will leverage the much-needed communities of practice involved in co-creating and transforming supervision and education of doctoral students in interdisciplinary water research.",Taka M.; Verbrugge L.; Varis O.,Journal,Water Research,2021-10-01,Aalto University,Doctoral students ;  Interdisciplinary ;  Supervisors ;  Team science ;  Water engineering ;  Water professional
Corporate digital responsibility (CDR) in construction engineering—ethical guidelines for the application of digital transformation and artificial intelligence (AI) in user practice,"Digitization is developing fast and has become a powerful tool for digital planning, construction and operations, for instance digital twins. Now is the right time for constructive approaches and to apply ethics-by-design in order to develop and implement a safe and efficient artificial intelligence (AI) application. So far, no study has addressed the key research question: Where can corporate digital responsibility (CDR) be allocated, and how shall an adequate ethical framework be designed to support digital innovations in order to make full use of the potentials of digitization and AI? Therefore, the research on how best practices meet their corporate responsibility in the digital transformation process and the requirements of the EU for trustworthy AI and its human-friendly use is essential. Its transformation bears a high potential for companies, is critical for success and thus, requires responsible handling. This study generates data by conducting case studies and interviewing experts as part of the qualitative method to win profound insights into applied practice. It provides an assessment of demands stated in the Sustainable Development Goals by the United Nations (SDGs), White Papers on AI by international institutions, European Commission and German Government requesting the consideration and protection of values and fundamental rights, the careful demarcation between machine (artificial) and human intelligence and the careful use of such technologies. The study discusses digitization and the impacts of AI in construction engineering from an ethical perspective. This research critically evaluates opportunities and risks concerning CDR in construction industry. To the author’s knowledge, no study has set out to investigate how CDR in construction could be conceptualized, especially in relation to digitization and AI, to mitigate digital transformation both in large, medium- and small-sized companies. This study applies a holistic, interdisciplinary, inclusive approach to provide guidelines for orientation and examine benefits as well as risks of AI. Furthermore, the goal is to define ethical principles which are key for success, resource-cost-time efficiency and sustainability using digital technologies and AI in construction engineering to enhance digital transformation. This study concludes that innovative corporate organizations starting new business models are more likely to succeed than those dominated by a more conservative, traditional attitude.",Weber-Lewerenz B.,Journal,SN Applied Sciences,2021-10-01,Engineering and Applied Sciences,AI ;  CDR ;  Construction engineering ;  Digital transformation ;  Digitization ;  Ethics
Fitting places in knowledge translation: Biomedical innovation in healthcare practice,"The purpose of this study is to examine and further develop knowledge translation in the context of a biomedical device industry. Studies have yet to explain how science-based innovation is first reduced to practice in development of new biomedical technologies. To understand how this occurs, I investigated research and commercial product development in the powered prosthetic arm industry from 1945 to 2020. The findings demonstrate the foundational roles of basic knowledge translation in the production of new knowledge for the powered upper limb industry, and integrated knowledge translation in hospital and clinic-based development of powered hands. The focus on a biomedical engineering industry limits the generalizability of the findings. Future research directions include examination of other cases to identify practices in embedding research projects in locations-of-use as well as virtual fitting spaces.",Foord D.,Journal,Health Policy,2021-10-01,University of New Brunswick,Biomedical engineering ;  Fitting places ;  Innovation ;  Knowledge translation ;  Prostheses ;  Transdisciplinarity
"Correction to: Does Proof of Concept Trump All? RRI Dilemmas in Research Practices (Science and Engineering Ethics, (2021), 27, 1, (7), 10.1007/s11948-021-00288-8)","The abstract was missing from this article and should have read: Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) is described as a new way of doing science that brings science closer to society. Based on a qualitatively oriented case study, this article supports previous research indicating that researchers face a variety of ethical problems and dilemmas when implementing RRI for the first time. These include difficulties with anticipating and controlling future impacts, an asymmetry of power between project partners and an elusive understanding of the RRI concept. The researchers’ challenges were rooted in conventional research ethics and could be boiled down to one core dilemma: If RRI had been applied from the very beginning of the project period, the chance of realising proof of concept within the scheduled time may decrease. The researchers’ solution to this dilemma was to prioritize proof of concept and postpone RRI activities to later stages of the project. If RRI is expected to live up to its ambition of representing a new way of doing science, more effort is needed at the political level to facilitate change.

The multiple roles of universities in U-I collaborations: The case of Emilia–Romagna motor vehicle industry,"This paper investigates the development of collaboration modes between university and local industry, within a regional system having a diffused innovation process. As a case study, we analyse into an appreciative framework the roles of a medium-sized university as producer of knowledge, intermediary organisation and regional orchestrator over time, ultimately assuming a leading role in two specific university-industry programmes supporting the motor vehicle industry of Emilia–Romagna (IT). The paper contributes to the University-Industry stream of research by identifying the factors and mechanisms underpinning the evolution of university's role in its collaboration with local industry, by the time assuming a leading and central role in spreading innovative technology into the regional system.

Instilling innovation and entrepreneurship in engineering graduate students: Observations at the University of Calgary,"Today's employers not only want graduates who are critical thinkers and problem solvers that are able to work in teams, but also individuals that understand innovation and how to use entrepreneurial activities to move innovations to become benefits to society. For research-based graduate students, this is even more desired, with emphasis on an understanding of innovation processes and the realization of the role that innovation plays for the survival and growth of existing corporations as well as the key contribution it makes in start-up companies. Many engineering programs focus on traditional engineering attributes, and although these are essential elements that engineering graduates should learn through their training, little attention is paid to innovation and the conversion of innovations to realized impacts. Here, we review innovation and discuss our experience with trainees (graduate students and post-doctoral scholars) and how to engage them in innovation activities. Our observation is that innovation is coachable and can be cultivated in research-based trainees. We recommend nine actions (understanding the challenge, motivation, safe and mentored local environment, tolerance to failure, diversity, rewarding of passion, awareness of the external, internal-external environment, and creative destruction and preservation) that trainees should be exposed to in order to promote innovation and entrepreneurial activities so that they can establish and/or strengthen their innovation and entrepreneurship muscles, which hopefully continues after they leave university.",Gates I.; Wang J.; Kannaiyan R.; Su Y.,Journal,Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering,2021-10-01,University of Calgary,entrepreneurship ;  graduate students ;  innovation ;  research group culture
On the progress of 3D-printed hydrogels for tissue engineering,"Abstract: Additive manufacturing or more commonly known as 3D printing, is currently driving innovations and applications in diverse fields such as prototyping, manufacturing, aerospace, education, and medicine. Recent technological and materials research breakthroughs have enabled 3D bioprinting, where biomaterials and cells are used to create scaffolds and functional living tissues (e.g. skin, cartilage, etc.). This prospective focuses on the classification and applications of hydrogels, and design considerations in their production (i.e. physical and biological parameters). The materials for 3D printing of hydrogels, such as biopolymers, synthetic polymers, and nanocomposites, are mainly discussed. More importantly, future perspectives on 3D printing hydrogels including new materials, 4D printing, emerging printing technologies, etc. and their importance in biomedical and bioengineering applications are discussed.

"Hollow-walled lattice materials by additive manufacturing: Design, manufacture, properties, applications and challenges","The rapid growth of additive manufacturing (AM) technologies has enabled the emergence of geometrically sophisticated materials or structures with tailored and/or enhanced mechanical responses. In addition to dense-walled lattice structures, innovation within the past decade has identified that hollow-walled lattice topologies exhibit the multifaceted potential of competitive strength and rigidity, whilst displaying unique deformation behaviours, indicating that they may be an important subsequent step in lattice evolution. Hollow-walled sections facilitate density and geometrical parameters well below what is achievable by dense-walled sections, providing additional hierarchies of architecture at micrometre to even nanoscale proportion. Their wall thickness can range from 20 nm to 800 µm while the relative density can span three orders of magnitude between 0.01% and 30%. Despite nearly a decade of research into hollow-walled lattice topologies, no meta-analysis exists to provide an informative overview of these structures. This research addresses this deficiency and provides a data-driven review of hollow-walled lattice materials. It elucidates how these hollow-walled lattices deviate from the current limitations of dense-walled lattices and the underlying mechanisms that dictate their performance, with data accumulated from an exhaustive collection of literature sources. A range of new insights into their design and manufacture is discussed for their future research and applications in different engineering fields.",Noronha J.; Qian M.; Leary M.; Kyriakou E.; Brandt M.,Journal,Current Opinion in Solid State and Materials Science,2021-10-01,RMIT University,Additive manufacturing ;  Hollow-walled lattice ;  Mechanical properties ;  Micro-architecture ;  Ultralow density
Optimization of Oxygen Delivery within Hydrogels,"The field of tissue engineering has been continuously evolving since its inception over three decades ago with numerous new advancements in biomaterials and cell sources and widening applications to most tissues in the body. Despite the substantial promise and great opportunities for the advancement of current medical therapies and procedures, the field has yet to capture wide clinical translation due to some remaining challenges, including oxygen availability within constructs, both in vitro and in vivo. While this insufficiency of nutrients, specifically oxygen, is a limitation within the current frameworks of this field, the literature shows promise in new technological advances to efficiently provide adequate delivery of nutrients to cells. This review attempts to capture the most recent advances in the field of oxygen transport in hydrogel-based tissue engineering, including a comparison of current research as it pertains to the modeling, sensing, and optimization of oxygen within hydrogel constructs as well as new technological innovations to overcome traditional diffusion-based limitations. The application of these findings can further the advancement and development of better hydrogel-based tissue engineered constructs for future clinical translation and adoption.",Mavris S.; Hansen L.,Journal,Journal of Biomechanical Engineering,2021-10-01,Georgia Institute of Technology;Emory University School of Medicine,
Cross-item learning for volatile demand forecasting: An intervention with predictive analytics,"Despite its importance to OM, demand forecasting has been perceived as a “problem-solving” exercise; most empirical work in the field has focused on explanatory models but neglected prediction problems that are part of empirical science. The present study, involving one of the leading electronics distributors in the world, aims to improve prediction accuracy under high demand volatility for procurement managers to make better inventory decisions. In response to requests for an integrated forecasting methodology, we undertook an iterative process based on three guiding principles—data pooling, theory-informed feature engineering, and ensemble-based machine learning. The resulting framework managed to improve forecast accuracy significantly and is applicable to a broad range of situations. We present reflections and insights derived abductively through engagement with managers in this problem situation. This “problem-driven” process corresponds to intervention as a research strategy that can foster theoretical and methodological innovations in OM. Our contribution goes beyond the development of the prediction framework as it elucidates ways OM researchers could leverage theoretical foundations to inform feature derivation and model construction. We posit that this work points to a way forward to the combination of OM principles with the emerging innovations in data science and artificial intelligence.",Chuang H.; Chou Y.; Oliva R.,Journal,Journal of Operations Management,2021-10-01,Mays Business School;National Chengchi University,data analytics ;  demand forecasting ;  feature engineering ;  intervention-based research ;  lead time ;  machine learning
Teaching innovation in an age of disruption,"In a climate of global disruptions, it seems certain that adaptive change will be an important part of our lives for the foreseeable future. Now, more than ever, we have a responsibility to introduce our students to skills that will support them in this work. This paper is a synthesis of a number of invited plenary talks given from 2014–2019 which explore the dichotomy of engineering: we are innovators and problem solvers who also hold reliability and protection of the public as our most important obligation. The data show that innovation will become more important in the decades ahead, but finding academics who love the uncertainty that comes with teaching design is becoming more difficult. The tension—and occasional polarization—between prioritizing innovation or maintaining reliable known solutions is deconstructed and explored. Two examples of how this plays out in industry are presented. The second half of the paper presents a selection of important ideas for teaching innovation thinking. Practical teaching strategies are included for easy implementation in the classroom. In closing, the major threads in (engineering) teaching and learning research are summarized, again, with samples of best practices in the context of teaching collaborative innovation. The goal of this paper is to provide engineering instructors with tools which are easily applied to build curiosity and an innovation mindset, without reducing their commitment to reliable and robust engineering problem solving.",Kresta S.,Journal,Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering,2021-10-01,University of Saskatchewan,engineering education ;  future of work ;  polarized ;  teaching innovation ;  teaching reliability
"Treading new ground in household sector innovation research: Scope, emergence, business implications, and diffusion","Individual consumers in the household sector increasingly develop products, services and processes, in their discretionary time without payment. Household sector innovation is becoming a pervasive phenomenon, representing a significant share of the innovation activity in any economy. Such innovation emerges from personal needs or self-rewards, and is distinct from and complementary to producer innovations motivated by commercial gains. In this introductory paper to the special issue on household sector innovation, we take stock of emerging research on the topic. We categorize the research into four areas: scope, emergence, implications for business, and diffusion. We develop a conceptual basis for the phenomenon, introduce the articles in the special issue, and show how each article contributes new insights. We end by offering a research agenda for scholars interested in the salient phenomenon of household sector innovation.",de Jong J.; Ben-Menahem S.; Franke N.; Füller J.; von Krogh G.,Journal,Research Policy,2021-10-01,ETH Zürich;Universität Innsbruck;Universiteit Utrecht;WU Vienna University of Economics and Business,

Overlapping community discovery for identifying key research themes,"Identifying key research themes is an effective way to chart knowledge structures in a field of research and, in turn, stimulate new ideas and innovation. Most thematic analyses of a research field are based on some form of network analysis, e.g., citations and cowords, and most of these networks are made up of cohesive, highly overlapping groups of nodes. Based on the suggestion that the ""universal features"" of networks are to be found in these overlapping communities, we argue that these same communities in a keyword network should reveal the key research themes in a field of study.With no traditional method with which to test our theory, we combined a cluster percolation algorithm with a Word2Vec model, and in a case study on information science, we were not only able to detect the overlapping communities in a keyword similarity network, but we also found a new perspective on the importance of overlapping communities as a way to identify a field's key research themes.",Huang L.; Liu F.; Zhang Y.,Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2021-10-01,University of Technology Sydney;Beijing Institute of Technology,Bibliometrics ;  Cluster analysis ;  Community detection ;  Word embedding

Identifying and assessing innovation pathways for emerging technologies: A hybrid approach based on text mining and altmetrics,"Accurately identifying core technological innovation pathways (TIPs) and evaluating opportunities in emerging technologies is important. In this article, we present an integrated framework that combines sentiment analysis, subject-action-object (SAO) analysis, machine learning, altmetrics, and expert judgments to extract technical intelligence, chart technological innovation pathways, and analyze which research avenues have the most future promise. For industry stakeholders, our approach provides a comprehensive, time-efficient, and future-oriented evaluation system to support decision making. For researchers, our methodology should inspire new ways of thinking about technological opportunity analysis-particularly, exploring the merits of finding new and advantageous combinations of existing bibliometric and nonbibliometric techniques, rather than reinventing the wheel. For example, this methodology is to integrate bibliometric analysis with sentiment analysis to gauge the attitudes of domain experts toward a topic's potential value. We combine SAO analysis and machine learning to identify relationships between topics from tremendous short texts. Beyond traditional techniques, we have also drawn on altmetrics to further validate the findings our of analysis. A case study on gold nanoparticles demonstrates the merits of our framework, revealing anti-cancer therapies and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) as the two applications with most future potential and societal impact in this field.",Zhou X.; Guo Y.; Li F.; Wang J.; Wei H.; Yu M.; Chen S.,Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2021-10-01,School of Management and Economics of UESTC;Xidian University;Beijing Institute of Technology;China University of Political Science and Law,Altmetrics ;  Gold nanoparticles ;  Sentiment analysis ;  Technological innovation pathways
"Need-solution pair recognition by household sector individuals: Evidence, and a cognitive mechanism explanation","Problem-solving by everyday individuals is thought to occur as a two-step process. First, an individual identifies or formulates a problem, followed by entering into a subsequent search to find the best solution. Here, however, we consider an alternative process that everyday individuals may use for solution finding first theorized by von Hippel and von Krogh (2016). Specifically, von Hippel and von Krogh proposed that everyday individuals may sometimes discover a solution and the need it satisfies simultaneously without the need for apriori problem formation, a cognitive process they called “need-solution pair recognition”. Utilizing a rich literature from psychology and neuroscience, we propose that seemingly spontaneous discoveries found by need-solution pair recognition are natural products of the object recognition system and its underlying mechanisms. This view asserts that on encountering an object and reasoning how it might be used (i.e. functional object understanding), an individual's perception of an object may culminate in recognizing the object as a solution, and in some cases, as a solution to a problem previously unknown to him or her, thus bypassing formal problem-formulation and active solution searching entirely. To empirically test this view, we manipulated the ability of everyday individuals to functionally reason about objects while we examined the spontaneous occurrence of solutions found by either need-solution pair recognition or traditional problem-first problem-solving. Consistent with our hypothesized mechanism, our results indicate that need-solution pair recognition occurs more frequently when constraints on functional object understanding are reduced. That is, we found that needsolution pair discoveries outpaced solutions found from traditional problem solving, in environments with unfamiliar objects, where participants were not directed to solve specific problems. Our results provide clear evidence that everyday individuals in the household sector do not always innovate through traditional problem-solving processes, but instead may arrive at solutions as they recognize and reason about objects. Implications for research and practice in household innovation, and for innovation more generally are considered.",Stock-Homburg R.; Heald S.; Holthaus C.; Gillert N.; Hippel E.,Journal,Research Policy,2021-10-01,The University of Chicago;MIT Sloan School of Management;Technische Universität Darmstadt,Creativity ;  Insight ;  Need-solution pairs ;  Object understanding ;  Problem-solving ;  Solution finding

Critical Capability Needs for Reduction of Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Indoors,"Coordination of efforts to assess the challenges and pain points felt by industries from around the globe working to reduce COVID-19 transmission in the indoor environment as well as innovative solutions applied to meet these challenges is mandatory. Indoor infectious viral disease transmission (such as coronavirus, norovirus, influenza) is a complex problem that needs better integration of our current knowledge and intervention strategies. Critical to providing a reduction in transmission is to map the four core technical areas of environmental microbiology, transmission science, building science, and social science. To that end a three-stage science and innovation Summit was held to gather information on current standards, policies and procedures applied to reduce transmission in built spaces, as well as the technical challenges, science needs, and research priorities. The Summit elucidated steps than can be taken to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 indoors and calls for significant investments in research to enhance our knowledge of viral pathogen persistence and transport in the built environment, risk assessment and mitigation strategy such as processes and procedures to reduce the risk of exposure and infection through building systems operations, biosurveillance capacity, communication form leadership, and stakeholder engagement for optimal response.

Materials Perspectives for Self-Powered Cardiac Implantable Electronic Devices toward Clinical Translation,"ConspectusRepresented by pacemakers, implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) are playing a vital life-saving role in modern society. Although the current CIEDs are evolving quickly in terms of performance, safety, and miniaturization, the bulky and rigid battery creates the largest hurdle toward further development of a soft system that can be attached and conform to tissues without causing undesirable physiologic changes. Over 50% of patients with pacemakers require additional surgery procedures to replace a drained battery. Abrupt battery malfunction and failure contributes up to 2.4% of implanted leadless pacemakers. The battery also has risks of lethal interference with diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Applying the implantable nanogenerators (i-NGs) technology to CIEDs is regarded as a promising solution to the battery challenge and enables self-powering capability. I-NGs based on the principle of either triboelectricity (TENG) or piezoelectricity (PENG) can convert biomechanical energy into electricity effectively. Meanwhile, a complete heartbeat cycle provides a biomechanical energy of ∼0.7 J or an average power of 0.93 W, which is sufficient for the operation of CIEDs considering the power consumption of 5-10 μW for a pacemaker and 10-100 μW for a cardiac defibrillator. It is therefore practical to leverage the effective, soft, flexible, lightweight, and biocompatible i-NGs to eliminate the bulky battery component in CIEDs and achieve self-sustainable operation. In this rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field, materials innovation acts as a cornerstone that frames the technology development. Here we bring a few critical perspectives regarding materials design and engineering, which are essential in leading the NG-powered CIEDs toward clinical translations. This Account starts with a brief introduction of the cardiac electrophysiology, as well as its short history to interface the state-of-the-art cardiac NG technologies. Three key components of NG-powered CIEDs are discussed in detail, including the NG device itself, the packaging material, and the stimulation electrodes. Cardiac NG is the essential component that converts heartbeat energy into electricity. It demands high-performance electromechanical coupling materials with long-term dynamic stability. The packaging material is critical to ensure a long-term stable operation of the device on a beating heart. Given the unique operation environment, a few criteria need to be considered in its development, including flexibility, biocompatibility, antifouling, hemocompatibility, and bioadhesion. The stimulation electrodes are the only material interfacing the heart tissue electrically. They should provide capacitive charge injection and mimic the soft and wet intrinsic tissues for the sake of stable biointerfaces. Driven by the rapid materials and device advancement, we envision that the evolution of NG-based CIEDs will quickly move from epicardiac to intracardiac, from single-function to multifunction, and with a minimal-invasive implantation procedure. This trend of development will open many research opportunities in emerging materials science and engineering, which will eventually lead the NG technology to a prevailing strategy for powering future CIEDs.",Li J.; Wang X.,Journal,Accounts of Materials Research,2021-09-24,UW-Madison College of Engineering,

Application of big data technology in the innovation of university education management work,"With the development of higher education in China, the scale of colleges and universities is expanding rapidly and the information of teaching management is developing rapidly. Facing the growing management information, it is inevitable to carry out education management innovation to meet the needs of the times. The use of teachers' resources and the assessment of teachers' classroom teaching quality must be solved by modern means to achieve the rational use and optimal allocation of teaching resources and improve the effectiveness of teaching management. The purpose of this paper is to study the application of big data(BD) technology in the innovation of university education management. This paper uses case study and literature research methods, combines data warehousing and data mining technologies in BD technology for evaluating teaching data with data warehousing as an organizational tool, and analyzes the current situation and future development trends of database technology data application in information management of educational administration construction in universities. The experimental results show that the ID3 algorithm performs better when there are fewer number of things and is about 10 seconds faster than the Apriori algorithm. But when the number of things are much more, the Apriori algorithm is significantly better than the ID3 algorithm. Moreover, the Apriori algorithm is more suitable for mining the deep laws of ungrasped objective things, and reveals unknown dependencies between data for rule mining with fuzzy concepts. Therefore, through analysis of data warehouse, data mining techniques and mining algorithms, by data mining of a large amount of assessment data, this paper finds that combining decision trees and association rule algorithms in data mining algorithms with teaching systems, data mining techniques introduced in educational assessment systems for assessment, not only improves the scientific nature of educational management, but also improves the effectiveness of digital education construction.",Yu W.,Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2021-09-24,Yunnan Technology and Business University;José Rizal University,Big Data Technology ;  Data Mining ;  Data Warehousing ;  University Education Management

Research on Lightweight Design Method Based on Biological Knowledge Acquisition,"In recent years, some countries have paid more and more attention to environmental protection and sustainable development and have been looking for new energy sources to replace non-renewable energy sources. Lightweight design is one of the ways to reduce energy consumption, but traditional lightweight design methods lack innovation in the principle of the product. Since the biological structure in nature always evolves in a way that minimizes energy consumption, this paper proposes a lightweight design method based on the acquisition of biological knowledge. By transferring biological knowledge to engineering design, we use the unique characteristics of biology to meet our design goals. First, some keywords are extracted from the design requirements of the target object and are expanded in the context of biological knowledge. Then, the expanded keywords are used to retrieve biological information in Asknature. Finally, python crawler is used to obtain biological knowledge to improve and optimize the target object and to achieve lightweight design.

Conduits for Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Reconstruction in Infants and Young Children,"Purpose of Review: Right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) reconstruction remains a challenge due to the lack of an ideal conduit. Data and experience are accumulating with each passing day. Therefore, it is necessary to review this topic from time to time. This is a 2021 update review focused on the history, evolution, and current situation of small-sized conduits (≤ 16 mm) for RVOT reconstruction in infants and young children. Recent Findings: Currently, the available small-sized (≤16 mm) conduits can meet most clinical needs. Homograft is still a reliable choice for infants and young children validated by a half-century clinical experience. As an alternative material, bovine jugular vein conduit (BJVC) has at least comparable durability with that of homograft. The performance of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) is amazing in RVOT position according to limited published data. The past century has witnessed much progress in the materials for RVOT reconstruction. However, lack of growth potential is the dilemma for small-sized conduits. Tissue-engineering based on cell-free scaffolds is the most promising technology to obtain the ideal conduit. Summary: No conduit has proved to have lifelong durability in RVOT position. We are far from the ideal, but we are not in a state of emergency. In-depth clinical research as well as innovation in material science are needed to help improve the durability of the conduits used in infants and young children.",Qian T.; Yuan H.; Chen C.; Liu Y.; Lu T.; Huang C.; Wu Z.,Journal,Frontiers in Surgery,2021-09-22,Central South University;Engineering Laboratory of Hunan Province for Cardiovascular Biomaterials,bovine jugular vein conduit ;  children ;  expanded polytetrafluoroethylene ;  homograft ;  right ventricular outflow react reconstruction ;  tissue engineering ;  valved conduit

Reactogenicity and immunogenicity after a late second dose or a third dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in the UK: a substudy of two randomised controlled trials (COV001 and COV002),"Background: COVID-19 vaccine supply shortages are causing concerns about compromised immunity in some countries as the interval between the first and second dose becomes longer. Conversely, countries with no supply constraints are considering administering a third dose. We assessed the persistence of immunogenicity after a single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), immunity after an extended interval (44–45 weeks) between the first and second dose, and response to a third dose as a booster given 28–38 weeks after the second dose. Methods: In this substudy, volunteers aged 18–55 years who were enrolled in the phase 1/2 (COV001) controlled trial in the UK and had received either a single dose or two doses of 5 × 1010 viral particles were invited back for vaccination. Here we report the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of a delayed second dose (44–45 weeks after first dose) or a third dose of the vaccine (28–38 weeks after second dose). Data from volunteers aged 18–55 years who were enrolled in either the phase 1/2 (COV001) or phase 2/3 (COV002), single-blinded, randomised controlled trials of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and who had previously received a single dose or two doses of 5 × 1010 viral particles are used for comparison purposes. COV001 is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04324606, and ISRCTN, 15281137, and COV002 is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04400838, and ISRCTN, 15281137, and both are continuing but not recruiting. Findings: Between March 11 and 21, 2021, 90 participants were enrolled in the third-dose boost substudy, of whom 80 (89%) were assessable for reactogenicity, 75 (83%) were assessable for evaluation of antibodies, and 15 (17%) were assessable for T-cells responses. The two-dose cohort comprised 321 participants who had reactogenicity data (with prime-boost interval of 8–12 weeks: 267 [83%] of 321; 15–25 weeks: 24 [7%]; or 44–45 weeks: 30 [9%]) and 261 who had immunogenicity data (interval of 8–12 weeks: 115 [44%] of 261; 15–25 weeks: 116 [44%]; and 44–45 weeks: 30 [11%]). 480 participants from the single-dose cohort were assessable for immunogenicity up to 44–45 weeks after vaccination. Antibody titres after a single dose measured approximately 320 days after vaccination remained higher than the titres measured at baseline (geometric mean titre of 66·00 ELISA units [EUs; 95% CI 47·83–91·08] vs 1·75 EUs [1·60–1·93]). 32 participants received a late second dose of vaccine 44–45 weeks after the first dose, of whom 30 were included in immunogenicity and reactogenicity analyses. Antibody titres were higher 28 days after vaccination in those with a longer interval between first and second dose than for those with a short interval (median total IgG titre: 923 EUs [IQR 525–1764] with an 8–12 week interval; 1860 EUs [917–4934] with a 15–25 week interval; and 3738 EUs [1824–6625] with a 44–45 week interval). Among participants who received a third dose of vaccine, antibody titres (measured in 73 [81%] participants for whom samples were available) were significantly higher 28 days after a third dose (median total IgG titre: 3746 EUs [IQR 2047–6420]) than 28 days after a second dose (median 1792 EUs [IQR 899–4634]; Wilcoxon signed rank test p=0·0043). T-cell responses were also boosted after a third dose (median response increased from 200 spot forming units [SFUs] per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs; IQR 127–389] immediately before the third dose to 399 SFUs per milion PBMCs [314–662] by day 28 after the third dose; Wilcoxon signed rank test p=0·012). Reactogenicity after a late second dose or a third dose was lower than reactogenicity after a first dose. Interpretation: An extended interval before the second dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 leads to increased antibody titres. A third dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 induces antibodies to a level that correlates with high efficacy after second dose and boosts T-cell responses.

Analogical Transfer between Heat Transfer and Electrology: (2) Engineering Practices,"To verify the feasibility and engineering practice value of the transfer analogy theory between heat transfer and electrology, this paper presents two typical applications addressing practical problems in the field of electrical engineering. Firstly, in view of lack of calculating method for the current carrying capacity of cable lying through unfavorable heat dissipation regions, we establish the radial thermal circuit of cable with the aid of thermal-electrical analogy analysis. The thermal resistance of insulating material and the loss in each layer of cable structure are equivalently evaluated, and further, the thermal circuit model with distributed parameters is constructed. The thought of solving the cable temperature distribution and carrying capacity is given, which compensates the insufficiency of the current calculation method recommended by IEC standard. Secondly, for the limitations of the prediction methods of hot-spot temperature in transformer, we develop the thermal circuit model with centralized parameters by incorporating the heat transfer process of transformer and the thermal-electrical analogy. Applying Kirchhoff current law to the thermal circuit model, a faster prediction method for calculating the hot-spot temperature is proposed. It is verified that the model has higher prediction accuracy than the method recommended by IEC standard. The results indicate that the thermal-electric analogy can solve engineering problems more practically and the transfer analogy can promote innovation and development of many interdisciplinary researches.",Li Y.; Wang C.; Zhang G.,Journal,Hsi-An Chiao Tung Ta Hsueh/Journal of Xi'an Jiaotong University,2021-09-10,Xi'an Jiaotong University,Engineering practices ;  Power cable ;  Thermal circuit model ;  Thermal-electrical analogy ;  Transformer

Engineering platform as integrated software for model mediated research,"Engineering software platform supports engineering activities in continuously widening disciplinary area of complex systems operated industrial and commercial products and other engineering achievements. Engineering activities increasingly include research extending the conventional product lifecycle engineering to the whole innovation cycle. Comprehensive engineering platform comprises wide range of integrated software solutions to manage complex model systems to represent situation controlled autonomous products and offers all software solutions necessary for the integrated innovation and life cycle. By now, engineering platforms are amongst the largest and most complex applications of advanced software. This paper reports recent contributions to concept and methodology of research integration representations for engineering model systems using research capabilities of engineering platform. First, concept on model organized research project (MORP) is introduced. MORP is a new model system based concept of research project which is managed using capabilities of software organized in these platforms. MORP relies on the formerly defined concept of model mediated research (MMR) which is extended to research in situation control of autonomous functions of the represented systems operated engineering achievements recognizing that situation control reorganizes engineering related research to a great extent. Following this, connection of MORP with software which provides situation based control for physical execution in cyber physical system (CPS) is analyzed and discussed. The MMR based MORP is about pilot projecting at the recently established virtual research laboratory (VRL) at the Doctoral School of Applied Informatics and Applied Mathematics (DSAIAM) at the Obuda University.",Horvath L.; Kovacs L.,Book Series,Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications,2021-09-08,Obuda University,extended model mediated research ;  model organized research project ;  Modeling software platform ;  research eligible engineering model system
"A Curriculum Integrating STEAM and Maker Education Promotes Pupils' Learning Motivation, Self-Efficacy, and Interdisciplinary Knowledge Acquisition","Contemporary society expects learners to synthesize large amounts of available information and take advantage of interdisciplinary knowledge to tackle complex, real-world issues. STEAM education aims to cultivate students' ability to solve such problems through interdisciplinary thinking but is often represented by courses that are merely disjointed arrays of school subjects. On the other hand, Maker education harnesses society's enthusiasm for technological innovation and creativity but overlooks the scientific principles that underpin these processes. This research presents a novel elementary school course informed by the interdisciplinary principles of STEAM, integrated with Maker's focus on technology and creativity. The course design also utilized engineering design as a meta-thematic framework. A total of 164 third-grade pupils participated in the research, with responses analyzed using descriptive statistical methods. The findings indicated that the integrated design of the course promoted pupils' learning motivation, self-efficacy, and acquisition of interdisciplinary knowledge. These effects were not gender-specific and demonstrate the potential applicability of a STEAM/Maker integrated approach to curriculum design in other settings.",Jia Y.; Zhou B.; Zheng X.,Journal,Frontiers in Psychology,2021-09-08,Central China Normal University,engineering design ;  interdisciplinary knowledge ;  learning motivation ;  Maker education ;  self-efficacy ;  STEAM and maker integrated curriculum ;  STEAM education
Frontiers of transdisciplinary research in tactile Internet with Human-in-the-Loop,"Recent technological advances in developing intelligent telecommunication networks, ultra-compact bendable wireless transceiver chips, adaptive wearable sensors and actuators, and secure computing infrastructures along with the progress made in psychology and neuroscience for understanding neurocognitive and computational principles of human behavior combined have paved the way for a new field of research: Tactile Internet with Human-in-the-Loop (TaHiL). This emerging field of transdisciplinary research aims to promote next generation digitalized human-machine interactions in perceived real time. To achieve this goal, mechanisms and principles of human goal-directed multisensory perception and action need to be integrated into technological designs for breakthrough innovations in mobile telecommunication, electronics and materials engineering, as well as computing. This overview highlights key challenges and the frontiers of research in the new field of TaHiL. Revolutionizing the current Internet as a digital infrastructure for sharing visual and auditory information globally, the TaHiL research will enable humans to share tactile and haptic information and thus veridically immerse themselves into virtual, remote, or inaccessible real environments to exchange skills and expertise with other humans or machines for applications in medicine, industry, and the Internet of Skills.",Fitzek F.; Li S.; Speidel S.; Strufe T.; Seeling P.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems,2021-09-06,Nationales Centrum für Tumorerkrankungen Dresden;Karlsruher Institut für Technologie;Technische Universität Dresden;Central Michigan University,Cyber-physical systems ;  Goal-directed behavior ;  Human-in-the-Loop ;  Human-machine adaptation ;  Intelligent networks ;  Internet of Skills ;  Multisensory perception ;  Tactile Internet
De Novo Powered Air-Purifying Respirator Design and Fabrication for Pandemic Response,"The rapid spread of COVID-19 and disruption of normal supply chains has resulted in severe shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), particularly devices with few suppliers such as powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs). A scarcity of information describing design and performance criteria for PAPRs represents a substantial barrier to mitigating shortages. We sought to apply open-source product development (OSPD) to PAPRs to enable alternative sources of supply and further innovation. We describe the design, prototyping, validation, and user testing of locally manufactured, modular, PAPR components, including filter cartridges and blower units, developed by the Greater Boston Pandemic Fabrication Team (PanFab). Two designs, one with a fully custom-made filter and blower unit housing, and the other with commercially available variants (the “Custom” and “Commercial” designs, respectively) were developed; the components in the Custom design are interchangeable with those in Commercial design, although the form factor differs. The engineering performance of the prototypes was measured and safety validated using National Institutes for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-equivalent tests on apparatus available under pandemic conditions at university laboratories. Feedback was obtained from four individuals; two clinicians working in ambulatory clinical care and two research technical staff for whom PAPR use is standard occupational PPE; these individuals were asked to compare PanFab prototypes to commercial PAPRs from the perspective of usability and suggest areas for improvement. Respondents rated the PanFab Custom PAPR a 4 to 5 on a 5 Likert-scale 1) as compared to current PPE options, 2) for the sense of security with use in a clinical setting, and 3) for comfort compared to standard, commercially available PAPRs. The three other versions of the designs (with a Commercial blower unit, filter, or both) performed favorably, with survey responses consisting of scores ranging from 3 to 5. Engineering testing and clinical feedback demonstrate that the PanFab designs represent favorable alternatives to traditional PAPRs in terms of user comfort, mobility, and sense of security.

Augmented Reality Media Development in Early Childhood Learning System During the Covid 19 Pandemic Era,"The phenomenon of the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the experience of children in the independent and responsible learning process. The policy of online learning carried out from home has been implemented in Early Childhood Education. The implementation of technological innovation needs to be applied to transform knowledge. The development of learning technology using Augmented Reality (A.R.) is the realization of needs actually by the media in early childhood learning materials. This research method uses a qualitative strand to explore in-depth information related to children's perceptions of initial data. Meanwhile, the quantitative strand data collection was used to measure the results of the widely implemented A.R. learning product trials dominant by strengthening quantitative data. The product development approach with exploratory sequential mix methods is a guideline for researching plural data collection. In developing A.R. learning media, it was found that 78.28% of learning media needs were related to learning motivation to use these technological devices. The development of A.R. media for early childhood leads to the theme of the surrounding environment that was previously designed through a storyboard. Implementation and evaluation of A.R. learning media for early childhood shows that using media is 83.7% from cognitive outcomes that support online learning. Cognitive abilities foster children's imagination in realizing ideas into expressions in exploring behavior in the environment during the learning period at home. Research findings from the application of children's learning technology can connect meaningful contextual sources and respond with enthusiasm. The meaning of learning media for early childhood is an effort to bring children's psychology closer during ""Learning to Home""learning which creates situations and conditions with technology and digitalization in education in the era of disruption that can change the existing system order.",Fajrie N.; Purbasari I.,Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2021-09-04,Universitas Muria Kudus,augemented reality ;  early childhood ;  learning media

Using Radical Innovation to Overcome Utility Trade-Offs in Urban Rail Systems in Megalopoleis,"Urban mobility is increasingly becoming accepted as a basic human need, as socio-economic opportunities depend on the ability to reach places within an acceptable time. Conversely, the emergence of megalopoleis as dominant features of the global landscape has increased commuting effort to unprecedented levels, due to the ever expanding urban areas and the associated travel distances. This now poses a risk to the efficient accessibility of cities, but there is an assumption that the problem can be overcome by increasing the speed of transport systems. However, advocates of this approach overlook important utility trade-offs that arise from the conflict between greater vehicle speeds and the additional time required to access the services. In this paper, we investigate this approach and show that higher speeds in metro systems do not always result in faster travel in cities. We then propose a new approach to addressing the problem, which culminates in a solution that can overcome the current paradoxes and increase door-to-door speeds more effectively. The resulting operational concept optimizes speed and coverage in urban rail systems in megalopoleis, accommodating the longer trips within time budgets. We position this research as a starting point to a new perspective on developing complex urban systems in the future.",Blumenfeld M.; Roberts C.; Schmid F.,Journal,Future Transportation,2021-09-01,University of Birmingham,capability engineering ;  metro systems ;  travel time budgets ;  urban rail ;  urban transport
The Interesting Challenges of Designing for Humans in Space,"Extra-terrestrial living and working environments are characterized by significant challenges in logistics, environmental demands, engineering, social and psychological issues, to name a few. Everything is limited: physical volume, air, water, power, and medicine … everything, even people, and therefore all is treated as valuable resource. This situation is complicated by the end product being the result of balancing many competing interests. The relationship between humans, space, and technology is forced, as well as a dynamic process. Although mathematical models for complex systems exist, long-term effects are hard to predict, and even more so to calculate. Even if we had technological solutions for all hazards and threats, there would still be the question of how these subsystems work together, how they are perceived, and if they are accepted by the inhabitants. Habitability design is vital to the success of future space exploration. Research into the dynamic system of ‘living together in an isolated and extreme environment for a long time’ does not lead to a single common solution. Instead, designers are left trying to translate differing first-person astronaut accounts into a solution bound by the constraints of physics, schedule, and cost. The early days of human spaceflight were all about discovery. Trying to replace conjecture with experience and fact. For example, the Moon was thought to have meters of soft dust that would swallow landing spacecraft. We have built on the successes and failures, but some achievements have also been forgotten. Today, we use these lessons to create effective designs for ‘living together in the isolated and extreme environment (ICE)’ of space. Following are descriptions of historical and newer examples of possible solutions that show what can be achieved when the demanding constraints of space inspire creative solutions for combining human needs with technological possibilities.",Häuplik-Meusburger S.; Griffin B.,Journal,Spool,2021-09-01,Technische Universität Wien;Genesis Engineering Solutions,creativity ;  critical design challenges ;  design consequences ;  design innovation ;  habitability design ;  in-situ-resources ;  Space architecture ;  space history
Relative Innovation Index: State of Patent Examination in India,"For the second decade in the 21st Century, the encouraging steps taken to foster the innovation environment in India have started bearing fruits by way of the introduction of new indigenous technologies1 in the market, specifically in the area of generic medicines as well as in engineering sectors with automotive as a prime example.2 Several initiatives3 have been taken by the Government of India (GOI) to increase Research and Development (R&D) activity in India, for example, in providing tax holidays and exemptions have resulted in the development of indigenous technologies and increased patent filing. However, the prime concern now is to handle such a large number of patent applications and disposal of patent applications by the Indian Patent Offices. The author uses the empirical investigation to identify the motive of legal provisions in the Indian Patent Act, 1970 and employs a quantitative method of research to the data published by the Indian Patent. This paper evaluates the disposal mechanism in terms of a number of First Examination Reports (FERs) issued across various years by the Indian Patent Officeand gives a performance indicator on its working efficiency. The study gives an overview of the Patent Prosecution Procedure for the disposal of patents in India.

Visualization of simulation results based on mobile augmented reality,"The convergence of engineering and information technology has brought many changes and innovations to the industry as well as academic research. In par-ticular, computer simulation technology has evolved from the level of replacing existing physical experiments to a level that can accurately simulate actual physical phenomena and analyze them in real time. In this paper, we describe the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technology, which is mainly used in industry, and the post-processor that uses Augmented Reality (AR), which is emerging as a latest visualization technology. Active research is underway to visualize CFD simulation results using AR technology, but it is only used to visualize data in a desktop environment due to the large size of the result data and the use of AR technology in CFD simulation that needs to be reviewed in real space is limited. To solve these problems in this study, we analyze the CFD results in the post-processing process, and then perform data optimization to support operation in the mobile environment. In the visualization process, lightweight data is used to perform real-time tracking using cloud computing, and the analysis result is matched to the screen and visualized. This allows the user to review and analyze the CFD analysis results in an efficient and immersive manner in various spaces where the simulation is performed. Finally, we show the usefulness of the proposed method for indoor air cleaning analysis results.",Kim M.; Seo D.; Park S.; Jeong S.,Journal,"ICIC Express Letters, Part B: Applications",2021-09-01,Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information;Dong-Eui University;Land and Geospatial Information Corporation,Augmented reality ;  Computation fluid dynamics ;  Lightweight data ;  Mobile environment

Biomimetic Designs for Automobile Engineering: A Review,"Automobile engineering often demands creative and innovative concepts to achieve their performance and efficiency targets. However, the strategies used to create these concepts are evolving with time. Recently, heightened attention has been noticed to using biomimetic concepts in the field of automobile design. The studies that apply biomimicry to automobile design often exhibit improvements in vehicle performance and fuel efficiency. Consequently, biomimetic concepts have extended an opportunity to the automobile industry to generate futuristic designs with advanced technology. However, the innovations and inventions in biology are usually published with more complex terminology that is not convenient for the research community working on automobile engineering. Hence, a notable delay is present in transferring the recent discoveries in biology to engineering researches so that they can develop strategies to mimic them. The purpose of this paper is to provide a brief overview of the biomimetic design approaches that have been and can be used in automobile design. In addition, the paper includes a classification of biomimetic concepts, which reveals the current research interests and highlights the areas with a deficit of research that is required to be addressed extensively in the future.",Wijegunawardana I.; de Mel W.,Journal,International Journal of Automotive and Mechanical Engineering,2021-09-01,University of Sri Jayewardenepura;University of Moratuwa,Automobile ;  Automotive ;  Biomimicry ;  Design ;  Nature-inspired
Senior DT - A Design Thinking Method to Improve Requirements Engineering for Elderly Citizens,"Requirement engineers face challenges in assessing the needs of elderly citizens, who typically differ a lot in terms of experiences, perspectives, and cognition. Design Thinking (DT) is a promising methodology for overcoming these barriers because it offers a structured approach for assessing users' needs and developing new ideas. However, DT needs to be adapted to the specifics of older participants to fully grasp these users' insights. For instance, the endurance of older participants is limited, and collaboration with other stakeholders is hampered due to decreasing physical, cognitive, and psychological capacity. This research utilizes a design science approach for developing the SeniorDT methodology. The core objectives of the SeniorDT method are the support of the older participants' engagement, the gathering of deep user insights, and the facilitation of the elderlies' collaboration with other workshop participants.

Synthesis and Characterization Scaffold Chitosan / Poly (ε-caprolactone) as Candidate for Skin Tissue Engineering in Burns,"Introduction: The development of skin tissue engineering as an alternative for burn therapy has advantages over biological dressing. Using Polycaprolactone (PCL) with chitosan in skin tissue engineering is expected to produce materials that meet the standards in skin tissue engineering. This research aims to study the variations of PCL in chitosan/PCL skin tissue engineering. Methods: From the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results, there were no difference in functional groups between four chitosan/PCL samples with variations in PCL concentration. They were all non toxic due to cytotoxicity assay. Results: The addition of PCL concentration also decreases the samples degradation rate but increases the sample contact angle. Conclusion: Based on these results, chitosan/PCL composites can be product innovation for skin tissue engineering based on the characteristics of fiber size, tensile strength, degradation rate, and biocompatibility.",Widiyanti P.; Gayatri D.; Rudyardjo D.,Journal,Malaysian Journal of Medicine and Health Sciences,2021-09-01,Universitas Airlangga,Burn ;  Chitosan ;  PCL ;  Product innovation ;  Scaffold
An analysis of unconscious gender bias in academic texts by means of a decision algorithm,"Inclusive language focuses on using the vocabulary to avoid exclusion or discrimination, specially referred to gender. The task of finding gender bias in written documents must be performed manually, and it is a time-consuming process. Consequently, studying the usage of non-inclusive language on a document, and the impact of different document properties (such as author gender, date of presentation, etc.) on how many non-inclusive instances are found, is quite difficult or even impossible for big datasets. This research analyzes the gender bias in academic texts by analyzing a study corpus of more than 12,000 million words obtained from more than one hundred thousand doctoral theses from Spanish universities. For this purpose, an automated algorithm was developed to evaluate the different characteristics of the document and look for interactions between age, year of publication, gender or the field of knowledge in which the doctoral thesis is framed. The algorithm identified information patterns using a CNN (convolutional neural network) by the creation of a vector representation of the sentences. The results showed evidence that there was a greater bias as the age of the authors increased, who were more likely to use non-inclusive terms; it was concluded that there is a greater awareness of inclusiveness in women than in men, and also that this awareness grows as the candidate is younger. The results showed evidence that the age of the authors increased discrimination, with men being more likely to use noninclusive terms (up to an index of 23.12), showing that there is a greater awareness of inclusiveness in women than in men in all age ranges (with an average of 14.99), and also that this awareness grows as the candidate is younger (falling down to 13.07). In terms of field of knowledge, the humanities are the most biased (20.97), discarding the subgroup of Linguistics, which has the least bias at all levels (9.90), and the field of science and engineering, which also have the least influence (13.46). Those results support the assumption that the bias in academic texts (doctoral theses) is due to unconscious issues: Otherwise, it would not depend on the field, age, gender, and would occur in any field in the same proportion. The innovation provided by this research lies mainly in the ability to detect, within a textual document in Spanish, whether the use of language can be considered non-inclusive, based on a CNN that has been trained in the context of the doctoral thesis. A significant number of documents have been used, using all accessible doctoral theses from Spanish universities of the last 40 years; this dataset is only manageable by data mining systems, so that the training allows identifying the terms within the context effectively and compiling them in a novel dictionary of non-inclusive terms.",Orgeira-Crespo P.; Míguez-Álvarez C.; Cuevas-Alonso M.; Rivo-López E.,Journal,PLoS ONE,2021-09-01,Universidade de Vigo,
Recent advances in intelligent source code generation: A survey on natural language based studies,"Source Code Generation (SCG) is a prevalent research field in the automation software engineering sector that maps specific descriptions to various sorts of executable code. Along with the numerous intensive studies, diverse SCG types that integrate different scenarios and contexts continue to emerge. As the ultimate purpose of SCG, Natural Language-based Source Code Generation (NLSCG) is growing into an attractive and challenging field, as the expressibility and extremely high abstraction of the input end. The booming large-scale dataset generated by open-source code repositories and Q&A resources, the innovation of machine learning algorithms, and the development of computing capacity make the NLSCG field promising and give more opportunities to the model implementation and perfection. Besides, we observed an increasing interest stream of NLSCG relevant studies recently, presenting quite various technical schools. However, many studies are bound to specific datasets with customization issues, producing occasional successful solutions with tentative technical methods. There is no systematic study to explore and promote the further development of this field. We carried out a systematic literature survey and tool research to find potential improvement directions. First, we position the role of NLSCG among various SCG genres, and specify the generation context empirically via software development domain knowledge and programming experiences; second, we explore the selected studies collected by a thoughtfully designed snowballing process, clarify the NLSCG field and understand the NLSCG problem, which lays a foundation for our subsequent investigation. Third, we model the research problems from technical focus and adaptive challenges, and elaborate insights gained from the NLSCG research backlog. Finally, we summarize the latest technology landscape over the transformation model and depict the critical tactics used in the essential components and their correlations. This research addresses the challenges of bridging the gap between natural language processing and source code analytics, outlines different dimensions of NLSCG research concerns and technical utilities, and shows a bounded technical context of NLSCG to facilitate more future studies in this promising area.",Yang C.; Liu Y.; Yin C.,Journal,Entropy,2021-09-01,Tongji University,Machine learning application ;  Natural language-based source code generation ;  Systematic literature review

It can be seen as a responsibility of universities' staff to provide the needed knowledge, skills, and attitudes that would enable graduated engineers to identify the companies' needs to obtain effective innovations. To develop this last aspect, the University must allow students to have the opportunity to get acquainted with students from other countries working in the same innovation development project.In this paper, an experience is presented that analyses the collaboration among five university partners. Students of these institutions have collaborated in 8 innovation engineering projects that were carried out in the fall of 2019. In February 2020, a symposium was organized in Eindhoven, The Netherlands, where students showcased their innovations. In total, about 67 students from different nationalities collaborated in these 8 projects. This paper will cover the experiences of students and teachers in these international innovation engineering projects.",Friesel A.; Watty R.; Florensa I.; Cruz J.; Klamert-Schmid J.; Lackner M.; De Souza Daneluz A.; Geraedts H.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 2021 30th Annual Conference of the European Association for Education in Electrical and Information Engineering, EAEEIE 2021",2021-09-01,Technical University of Denmark,communication skills ;  innovation skills ;  interdisciplinary projects ;  International innovation projects ;  multicultural skills
Environment for Innovative University Research Training in the Field of Digital Test,"In this paper we target three methods and goals for teaching research, called active learning, authentic learning by doing and reflexing learning. We discuss the student-centred learning for research in the field of computer engineering, particularly the design and test of digital systems such as microprocessors. The more complex electronics systems are getting, the more important is testing. Today, design and test are no longer separate issues. The emphasis on the quality of products requires testing to be considered early in the design process. However, most VLSI and system designers know little about testing. This reflects today's university education, where design is the main teaching issue, whereas testing is covered only superficially. Therefore, the focus in this paper is set on teaching and learning approaches of the research problems of reliability and testing of digital systems, motivated by today's trends in the computer industry, and by the need of industry for educated young engineers in line with these trends. The emerged paradigm of testing systems, such as microprocessors or controllers is software based self-test (SBST). However, today's solutions in this field are insufficient, and there is a big need for research to improve test quality, especially in cases where no information about implementation is given. To fill up the gap between university teaching and industry needs in the test field, we have developed a framework for supporting research oriented training of computer engineering students in hardware design and test, which consists of both commercial tools and in-house advanced tools for test generation. To enhance thorough understanding and creativity of students, we have created different task variations based on the framework, which could stand as a good ground for lab research.",Oyeniran A.; Ademilua T.; Kruus M.; Ubar R.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 2021 30th Annual Conference of the European Association for Education in Electrical and Information Engineering, EAEEIE 2021",2021-09-01,,education in computer engineering ;  innovation in engineering education ;  research oriented teaching ;  teaching design and test of systems
"The integrative expert: Moral, epistemic, and poietic virtues in transformation research","Over the past 50 years, policy makers have sought to shape new and emerging technologies in light of societal risks, public values, and ethical concerns. While much of this work has taken place during “upstream” research prioritization and “downstream” technology regulation, the actual “midstream” work of engineers and other technical experts has increasingly been seen as a site for governing technology in society. This trend towards “socio-technical integration” is reflected in various governance frameworks such as Sustainable Development (SD), Technology Assessment (TA), and Responsible Innovation (RI) that are at the center of transformation research. Discussions around SD, TA, and RI often focus on meso-and macro-level processes and dynamics, with less attention paid to the qualities of individuals that are needed to support transformation processes. We seek to highlight the importance of micro-level practices by drawing attention to the virtues of technical experts. Drawing on empirical study results from embedding philosophical-reflective dialogues within science and engineering laboratories, we claim that poietic, as well as moral and epistemic, virtues belong to those required of technical experts who foster integrative practices in transformation research.",Poznic M.; Fisher E.,Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2021-09-01,Karlsruher Institut für Technologie;Arizona State University,Engineering practice ;  Interdisciplinary collaboration ;  Responsible innovation ;  Socio-technical integration ;  Transformation research ;  Virtues
Impact of environmental subsidies on environmental technology innovation of polluting enterprises,"Environmental technology innovation plays an important role in solving pollution control problems. Under the background of the green development of the polluting industry, environmental subsidies have become an important financial instrument to make up for the lack of capital market. To explore the motivation of environmental technology innovation supported by environmental subsidies, using the data of listed polluting enterprises in China from 2013 to 2019, the impact of environmental subsidies on environmental technology patents of polluting enterprises was discussed from the perspective of selective industrial policies. Results show that environmental subsidies stimulate the total number of environmental technology patents and non-invention patents to increase significantly, showing the behavior characteristics of enterprises pursuing innovation quantity while ignoring quality. When enterprises expected to get more environmental subsidies, they make environmental technology patents to seek support. The above phenomenon is only significant in the state-owned enterprise group and senior executives group with a technical background in the group analysis results. The number of environmental technology invention patents of private enterprises increased significantly. The selective environmental subsidies policy stimulates the strategic innovation of enterprises, while the environmental technology invention patents representing substantive innovation and high-quality innovation are not improved significantly. The managerial implication of the conclusions is that the government should not only consider increasing environmental subsidies to polluting enterprises in the future but also should support better regulatory policies to improve the level of pollution prevention and control through environmental technology innovation.",Han C.,Journal,Nature Environment and Pollution Technology,2021-09-01,Henan University of Engineering,Environmental subsidies ;  Green innovation ;  Green patent ;  Strategic innovation
Lessons learnt from engineering science projects participating in the horizon 2020 open research data pilot,"Trends in the sciences are indicative of data management becoming established as a feature of the mainstream research process. In this context, the European Commission introduced an Open Research Data pilot at the start of the Horizon 2020 research programme. This initiative followed the success of the Open Access pilot implemented in the prior (FP7) research programme, which thereafter became an integral component of Horizon 2020. While the Open Access phenomenon can reasonably be argued to be one of many instances of web technologies disrupting established business models (namely publication practices and workflows established over several centuries in the case of Open Access), initiatives designed to promote research data management have no established foundation on which to build. For Open Data to become a reality and, more importantly, to contribute to the scientific process, data management best practices and workflows are required. Furthermore, with the scientific community having operated to good effect in the absence of data management, there is a need to demonstrate the merits of data management. This circumstance is complicated by the lack of the necessary ICT infrastructures, especially interoperability standards, required to facilitate the seamless transfer, aggregation and analysis of research data. Any activity aiming to promote Open Data thus needs to overcome a number of cultural and technological challenges. It is in this context that this paper examines the data management activities and outcomes of a number of projects participating in the Horizon 2020 Open Research Data pilot. The result has been to identify a number of commonly encountered benefits and issues; to assess the utilisation of data management plans; and through the close examination of specific cases, to gain insights into obstacles to data management and potential solutions. Although primarily anecdotal and difficult to quantify, the experiences reported in this paper tend to favour developing data management best practices rather than doggedly pursue the Open Data mantra. While Open Data may prove valuable in certain circumstances, there is good reason to claim that managed access to scientific data of high inherent intellectual and financial value will prove more effective in driving knowledge discovery and innovation.",Austin T.; Bei K.; Efthymiadis T.; Koumoulos E.,Journal,Data,2021-09-01,European Commission Joint Research Centre;INNOVATION IN RESEARCH & ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS,Advanced characterisation ;  Data management plan ;  Digitisation ;  Horizon 2020 ;  Interoperability ;  Materials properties
Leveraging a community of practice to build faculty resilience and support innovations in teaching during a time of crisis,"Amidst the COVID-19 upheaval to higher education, a grantor-led community of practice (CoP) supported faculty members to deliver an innovative, sustainability-oriented entrepreneurship curriculum and maintain resiliency as teaching professionals. This paper discusses how through engagement in the CoP, this group of faculty from across engineering, material science, business, and geosciences demonstrated resilience, adaptability, and pivoted to create curriculum for students in real time, as the events of the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded throughout 2020 and impacted face-to-face learning. The role the community of practice played in sustaining and supporting the faculty will be discussed. Case studies from faculty members will demonstrate how sustainable design and social responsibility can be integrated into entrepreneurially focused classes and student experiences across disciplines. The primary contribution of this research is the important role that an emergent learning framework can play in informing how best to optimize the CoP format and approach in a way that leverages and addresses individual member strengths, challenges, and experiences, and supports the needs of CoP members during a time of significant change and crisis.",Mead T.; Pietsch C.; Matthew V.; Lipkin-Moore S.; Metzger E.; Avdeev I.; Ruzycki N.,Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2021-09-01,College of Engineering & Applied Science;Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering;San Jose State University;Western Colorado University;VentureWell,COVID-19 ;  Faculty community of practice ;  Resilience ;  Sustainability-oriented entrepreneur-ship education ;  Teaching cases
"The effects of gamified flipped learning method on student’s innovation skills, self-efficacy towards virtual physics lab course and perceptions","Laboratory courses are extremely important in Physics education in terms of providing a better understanding of the theoretical course subjects by the students. However, since the COVID-19 epidemic caused education to be carried out remotely and digitally all over the world, practical as well as theoretical courses were moved to digital platforms. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of the Gamified Flipped Learning (GFL) method on students’ physics self-efficacy and innovation skills in a virtual physics laboratory course. The study was carried out with true experimental design and the participants were a total of 70 first-year engineering students, which were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group was trained with the GFL method, the control group was trained with Classical Flipped Learning (CFL) method. Data were collected from a physics self-efficacy questionnaire, innovative skills questionnaire, and semi-structured interviews form. The research results showed that GFL method has a positive impact on the innovation skills of students although insignificant improvement was introduced by gamified-flipped learning on students’ self-efficacy. In addition, the interviews with the students revealed a positive perception of gamification, by mentioning some important aspects of the process that were extremely beneficial.",Ahmed H.; Asiksoy G.,Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2021-09-01,Yakın Doğu Üniversitesi,Flipped learning ;  Gamification ;  Innovation skills ;  Self-efficacy ;  Virtual lab

Inclusion of education for sustainable development in environmental engineering. A systematic review,"Sustainable development (SD) is a global commitment, in the economic, social, and environmental terms of the 21st century. The SD integrates conventional development models that seek economic growth and human development, within the framework of respect and sustainable use of natural resources. This challenge must involve all levels of society. Higher education is not an exception, since universities must strive for knowledge, research, and innovation to promote SD. To achieve this, education for sustainable development (ESD) has been especially promoted by the United Nations. ESD is an indirect measurement instrument for the inclusion of SD in higher education curricula. Environmental engineering is one of the areas of most recent creation and expansion of engineering, this undergraduate program seeks to solve the environmental problems generated by the economic development of human beings, applying the theory, techniques, and technologies of engineering. With this systematic literature review (SLR), we were able to answer different research questions posed towards the most relevant competencies, techniques, and tools for the inclusion of ESD in the environmental engineering curriculum. This SLR was developed by searching the Science Direct, Scopus, and ERIC databases. We were able to identify success stories for the inclusion of ESD and some gaps in promoting ESD within undergraduate programs in environmental engineering. Likewise, we find the most applied activities, tools, and competencies within this engineering field that are part of ESD and promote SD from the curriculum.",Acosta Castellanos P.; Queiruga-Dios A.; Álvarez L.,Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2021-09-01,Universidad Santo Tomás;Universidad de Salamanca,Education for sustainable development ;  Educational strategies ;  Environmental engineering ;  Systematic review ;  University education
Enablers and barriers in the market-driven rollout of smart metering: Polish technology innovation system analysis,"This paper is the first country-specific analysis of the market-driven Smart Metering innovation system, covering technologies, actors, and policies. It provides new insights on the key enablers and barriers in the rollout of electricity Smart Meters (SMs) without binding regulatory man-date. The presented research is based on the Technology Innovation System (TIS) analysis for Po-land, where an obligation scheme for the rolling out of SMs has been introduced very recently. Still, the number of SMs installed places the country in the top 10 Member States of the European Union. The implementation of SMs is progressing in a complex, multi-actor innovation system, shaped by the leading role of Distribution System Operators (DSOs). The article analyses the key elements of the SM innovation system (technologies and infrastructures, actors and networks, institutions and policies) and characterizes their interaction based on desk research and a critical assessment of regulations, statistics, and literature. The major enablers of the rollout are DSOs expectations of bene-fits, which have been instigated by the market regulator’s benevolence in tariffs approval. On the other hand, the major barriers are delayed and incomplete public policy instruments. Results of the study can inform the development of other market-driven SM deployments around the world.",Kochański M.; Korczak K.; Skoczkowski T.,Journal,Energies,2021-09-01,Research and Innovation Centre Pro-Akademia;Politechnika Warszawska,Electricity metering ;  Poland ;  Smart Meter ;  Smart Metering ;  Technology Innovation System
Human Factors in NDE 4.0 Development Decisions,"Stage-gate process is a project management technique that has been used to manage major technology development and deployment projects for over 50 years. It emphasizes quality, risk, and value, and provides an orderly framework for decision making with multiple projects carried out concurrently. This paper will examine the potential application of this process to NDE 4.0 developments. This paper will also explore the factors that make a stage-gate process successful, and how biases affect the outcomes of gate reviews. It explores which biases are problematic and how we can de-bias our own interpretation of them through conscious awareness and re-thinking the Stage-Gate Process. It also discusses how to create an environment where biases are minimized or eliminated. During research and reporting of this manuscript, the human authors synthesized their decades of experience in engaging with technology development decisions, with contributions from an artificial intelligence agent GPT-3 on human biases and motivations. This was done to capture the firsthand experience of collaborating with AI in the spirit of increasing the role of machine intelligence in human–machine systems, typical of NDE. Since this appeared to be an innovative approach, the authors decided to use the gated process in creating this paper with AI as a co-author. The details are presented as a case study within the paper. The topic is important because, managers are struggling to embrace the NDE 4.0 initiative, despite its importance and their willingness. Leveraging AI partnership to even address this important topic is a testament to cognitive capability of learning machines to help inspection systems with creating test procedures, making decisions, and creating test reports. This manuscript is the first attempt at qualitative treatment of human factors in gated innovation process with research assisted by an Artificial Intelligence based language model (non-human).

Green technology innovation path based on blockchain algorithm,"The core of green technological innovation is to protect the ecology. The innovative introduction of ecological concepts into the existing ecosystem can ensure the sustainable development and progress of society. This paper mainly studies the path analysis of green technology innovation based on blockchain algorithm. Aiming at the high latency and low efficiency of pbft algorithm in green technology innovation, a low latency consensus algorithm ipbft based on an alternative voting mechanism is proposed. Explore the influencing factors of domestic realization of green technology innovation, clarify the reasons that hinder green technology innovation and give reasonable strategies to help domestic green technology innovation work to be carried out faster and better. This article compares the ipbft algorithm with the improved consensus algorithms cpbft, vpbft and pbft in recent years. Experimental results show that the consensus delay of the ipbft algorithm is much lower than that of the other three algorithms, and the average delay of the ipbft single consensus is only about 370ms. In different transaction volume and different node number throughput performance tests, the ipbft throughput in these two tests is better than the other three algorithms. In the view switching phase, the ipbft algorithm also takes less time than the other three algorithms. The above results show that the ipbft algorithm has lower consensus delay and higher throughput, which can reduce network communication overhead and save system transmission energy consumption. It can ensure the security and authenticity of information in the green technology innovation based on blockchain, and reduce system overhead.",Li D.,Journal,Sustainable Computing: Informatics and Systems,2021-09-01,"School of Business Administration, Northeastern University",Blockchain technology ;  Consensus algorithm ;  Decentralized algorithm ;  Green technology innovation
Synthetic biology: Old and new dilemmas—the case of artificial life,"This article aims to examine some of the ethical questions emerging from the use of already existing biotechnological tools and the issues which might occur by synthetic biology’s potential future possibilities. In the first part, the essence of synthetic biology and its relation to the contemporary biotechnological research is analyzed. In the second part, the article examines whether the new biotechnological inventions pose new or revive old moral questions about the ethics of science, engineering, and technology in general. After briefly addressing some of the various issues which are raised by experts, philosophers, but also the general public, concerning synthetic biology in general, it focuses on the topic of “artificial life creation” and presents moral reasons which may or may not allow it. The topic is approached by referring to consequentialist, deontological, but also, virtue theory arguments for and against it and the possibility of a partial permission of “artificial life” experiments, asking whether the benefits outweigh the risks and moral implications is explored. Finally, it proposes an argument in favor of the future exploration of biological innovation, underlying the need for a more balanced access to its beneficial results.",Kolisis N.; Kolisis F.,Journal,BioTech,2021-09-01,National and Kapodistrian University of Athens;National Technical University of Athens (NTUA),Bioethics ;  Biotechnology ;  Ethics ;  Synthetic biology ;  Synthetic life ;  System biology
3D printing with particles as feedstock materials,"3D printing has been applied in numerous research fields ranging from biomedical, mechanical engineering and chemistry to material science. 3D printing applications have driven innovations in particle technology, especially through tackling particle-related issues arising from the development of particle-based printing feedstocks across such application areas. Therefore, in this review, established 3D printing processes are described to include their prototyping mechanisms, advantages and limitations. Various particulate systems, including dry and wet systems, as printing feedstock materials are introduced. The main motivation for this paper is to outline the current state of particulate feedstock systems and to attempt to outline future directions for enhancing these particle applications.

Assessing learning in low carbon technologies: Toward a more comprehensive approach,"With decades of experience developing and deploying low carbon technologies around the world, much has been learned. We assess six categories that represent the diversity of methodological approaches that have been used to study low carbon learning: (1) learning curves; (2) expert elicitations; (3) patent analysis; (4) engineering-based decomposition; (5) policy intervention studies; and (6) case studies. Based on a review of low carbon learning studies in these six areas, we summarize what we know about low carbon learning, and what we have yet to fully understand, including the methodological strengths and limitations of key studies conducted to date. We find that a more comprehensive understanding of low carbon learning is necessary and timely given the massive scale and short time horizon of the low carbon transition, and that there are real benefits to employing a comprehensive approach using multiple methods. We find a need for better data sets, and for studies of a more diverse set of technologies, as well as of interactions among technologies. In addition, studies should be more explicit about local context, with a particular need for additional focus on emerging and developing countries. We identify key topics that warrant further research, including technology specific learning methods; spatial distinctions and the local and global linkages that influence learning; and an expanded study of the cultural, social, environmental, and political factors that influence learning. Finally, we recommend more nuance in the design of policies directed at accelerating low carbon learning.

Add the Finishing Touch: Molecular Engineering of Conjugated Small Molecule for High-Performance AIE Luminogen in Multimodal Phototheranostics,"Phototheranostics based on luminogens with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics is captivating increasing research interest nowadays. However, AIE luminogens are inherently featured by inferior absorption coefficients (ε) resulting from the distorted molecular geometry. Besides, molecular innovation of long-wavelength light-excitable AIE luminogens with highly efficient phototheranostic outputs is an appealing yet significantly challenging task. Herein, on the basis of a fused-ring electron acceptor–donator–acceptor (A–D–A) type molecule (IDT) with aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) properties, molecular engineering smoothly proceeds and successfully yields a novel AIE luminogen (IDT-TPE) via simply modifying tetraphenylethene (TPE) moieties on the sides of IDT backbone. The AIE tendency endows IDT-TPE nanoparticles with enhanced fluorescence brightness and far superior fluorescence imaging performance to IDT nanoparticles for mice tumors. Moreover, IDT-TPE nanoparticles exhibit near-infrared light-excitable features with a high ε of 8.9 × 104 m−1 cm−1, which is roughly an order of magnitude higher than that of most previously reported AIE luminogens. Combining with their reactive oxygen species generation capability and extremely high photothermal conversion efficiency (59.7%), IDT-TPE nanoparticles actualize unprecedented performance in multimodal phototheranostics. This study thus brings useful insights into the development of versatile phototheranostic materials with great potential for practical cancer theranostics.",Li D.; Li Y.; Wu Q.; Xiao P.; Wang L.; Wang D.; Tang B.,Journal,Small,2021-09-01,"The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen;Hong Kong University of Science and Technology;Shenzhen University",aggregation-induced emission ;  cancer phototheranostics ;  molecular engineering ;  synergistic phototherapy
Implementation of the challenge-based learning approach in Academic Engineering Programs,"In a world that changes very fast, it is necessary that educational models evolve at the same speed and that teachers are increasingly prepared and open to deal with current problems. Tecnológico de Monterrey has implemented the Tec21 Educational Model based on four fundamental pillars: (a) Challenge-Based Learning (CBL); (b) flexibility; (c) trained, inspiring teachers, and (d) memorable, integrated educational experiences. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of the implementation of CBL experiences in two engineering areas within the campus, namely, Mechatronics and Biotechnology. In this article, we first present how a group of teachers adopted CBL as a teaching technique, and second, we describe the implementation of flexible education with external training partners using CBL in “FIT” (Flexible Technology, Interactive) courses. We also analyze various ways to assess the impact of digital technology tools like CANVAS, REMIND, ZOOM, and eLUMEN on competencies. The results of this research indicated that students acquire more knowledge in CBL classes; however, the teachers require an adequate training program and must have previously designed proficiency assessment instruments. The testing of various evaluation instruments found that checklists and evaluation rubrics were the most suitable, objective, and transparent in CBL classes, according to the surveys of teachers and students.",Membrillo-Hernández J.; de Jesús Ramírez-Cadena M.; Ramírez-Medrano A.; García-Castelán R.; García-García R.,Journal,International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing,2021-09-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Challenge-based Learning ;  Educational Innovation ;  FIT courses ;  Higher Education ;  Tec21 Educational Model
Children's implicit theories of creativity in science,"Science is a source of innovation, but are scientists perceived as creative? This question seems particularly important, as the way in which science and scientists are perceived might affect students’ attitudes towards STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). If this perception is biased or overly stereotypical, it might have a detrimental effect on whether students will consider pursuing a science-related career. In this study, we investigated Polish elementary school students’ implicit theories of creativity in science. Nearly five hundred students (N = 489, 54% girls) were asked to produce detailed drawings representing how they perceive a scientist. Each drawing was then scored in several categories, with a particular focus on the signs of stereotypical perception of scientists. This stereotypical perception was found to be quite persistent: more than half of the drawings contained at least one stereotypical element (most predominantly male gender). The degree of the stereotypical depiction of scientists was higher among boys than girls and negatively related to students’ learning goals. We discuss the theoretical consequences of these findings as well as future research directions.",Potęga vel Żabik K.; Tanaś Ł.; Iłowiecka-Tańska I.; Karwowski M.,Journal,Thinking Skills and Creativity,2021-09-01,SWPS Uniwersytet Humanistycznospołeczny;University of Wrocław;Copernicus Science Centre,Gender ;  Implicit theories of creativity ;  Perception ;  Science ;  Stereotype
Opportunity-led ideation: How to convert corporate opportunities into innovative ideas,"Opportunities, that is, action possibilities for innovative business models, goods, services and processes, particularly affect idea generation, which is vital for innovation success. Capitalizing on opportunities requires complementing predominating problem-centred innovation approaches. Despite mature knowledge on idea generation, there is still a limited understanding on how to leverage opportunities. Hence, there is a limited set of methods available that provide formalized guidance. To address this gap, we co-developed an opportunity-led ideation method in an action design research project with one of Australia's leading financial service providers. Thanks to this immersive collaboration, our method reflects not only the intent of researchers and existing knowledge but also the influence and needs of practitioners. Building on established opportunity sources from the literature, this method structures the idea generation stage of the innovation process into the activities initiation, immersion, investigation and integration. The method provides guidance on how to transform opportunities into ideas and presents activities, techniques, tools and roles that are important within the idea generation stage. Our research theoretically extends the understanding of opportunity identification within the front end of innovation. Moreover, it provides insights on balancing formalization and creativity within idea generation. Organizations can use the method as a blueprint to systematically and proactive sense, assess and translate opportunities into ideas.",Wyrtki K.; Röglinger M.; Rosemann M.,Journal,Creativity and Innovation Management,2021-09-01,Universität Bayreuth;Queensland University of Technology;Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Information Technology FIT,action design research ;  innovation ;  opportunity discovery ;  situational method engineering
The entrepreneurial logic of startup software development: A study of 40 software startups,"Context: Software startups are an essential source of innovation and software-intensive products. The need to understand product development in startups and to provide relevant support are highlighted in software research. While state-of-the-art literature reveals how startups develop their software, the reasons why they adopt these activities are underexplored. Objective: This study investigates the tactics behind software engineering (SE) activities by analyzing key engineering events during startup journeys. We explore how entrepreneurial mindsets may be associated with SE knowledge areas and with each startup case. Method: Our theoretical foundation is based on causation and effectuation models. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 40 software startups. We used two-round open coding and thematic analysis to describe and identify entrepreneurial software development patterns. Additionally, we calculated an effectuation index for each startup case. Results: We identified 621 events merged into 32 codes of entrepreneurial logic in SE from the sample. We found a systemic occurrence of the logic in all areas of SE activities. Minimum Viable Product (MVP), Technical Debt (TD), and Customer Involvement (CI) tend to be associated with effectual logic, while testing activities at different levels are associated with causal logic. The effectuation index revealed that startups are either effectuation-driven or mixed-logics-driven. Conclusions: Software startups fall into two types that differentiate between how traditional SE approaches may apply to them. Effectuation seems the most relevant and essential model for explaining and developing suitable SE practices for software startups.",Nguyen-Duc A.; Kemell K.; Abrahamsson P.,Journal,Empirical Software Engineering,2021-09-01,University of Jyväskylä;University of South-Eastern,Case study ;  Effectuation index ;  Effectuation theory ;  Entrepreneurial logics ;  Software engineering for startups ;  Software startup engineering
Broadening the ecological mindset,"Over the past three decades, the Harvard Forest Summer Research Program in Ecology (HF-SRPE) has been at the forefront of expanding the ecological tent for minoritized or otherwise marginalized students. By broadening the definition of ecology to include fields such as data science, software engineering, and remote sensing, we attract a broader range of students, including those who may not prioritize field experiences or who may feel unsafe working in rural or urban field sites. We also work towards a more resilient society in which minoritized or marginalized students can work safely, in part by building teams of students and mentors. Teams collaborate on projects that require a diversity of approaches and create opportunities for students and mentors alike to support one another and share leadership. Finally, HF-SRPE promotes an expanded view of what it means to become an ecologist. We value and support diverse career paths for ecologists to work in all parts of society, to diversify the face of ecology, and to bring different perspectives together to ensure innovations in environmental problem solving for our planet.",Ellison A.; Barker Plotkin A.; Patel M.; Record S.,Journal,Ecological Applications,2021-09-01,Bryn Mawr College;Harvard Forest;Sound Solutions for Sustainable Science,broadening participation ;  data science ;  ecologies ;  grand challenges ;  near-peer mentoring ;  teamwork
Identifying Maturity Dimensions for Smart Maintenance Management of Constructed Assets: A Multiple Case Study,"While smart maintenance is gaining popularity in professional engineering and construction management practice, little is known about the dimensions of its maturity. It is assumed that the complex networked environment of maintenance and the rise of data-driven methodologies require a different perspective on maintenance. This paper identifies maturity dimensions for smart maintenance of constructed assets that can be measured. A research design based on two opposite cases is used and data from multiple sources is collected in four embedded case studies in corporate facility management organizations.

"South African drought, deconstructed","Drought is a slow onset, recurring and inevitable feature of South Africa's climate. This research deconstructs the meteorological processes underlying drought and its impacts on surface temperature and vegetation in the more productive eastern half of South Africa. We use an index area 22–31°S, 22–32°E and extract monthly satellite and reanalysis data in the period 1979–2019. Drought intensity is determined by i) vegetation color, ii) soil moisture, iii) maximum air temperature and iv) net outgoing longwave radiation. Global drivers are represented by tropical Pacific and Indian Ocean sea temperatures. Composite and regression analysis of drought reveals a mid-tropospheric anticyclone over Namibia induces equatorward flow and subsidence that drives away atmospheric moisture. This feature is associated with the Pacific El Niño, positive Indian Ocean Dipole and an accelerated westerly jet stream. Ocean warming east of Madagascar draws NW-cloud bands there. The advection of anticyclonic vorticity from the South Atlantic and standing atmospheric Rossby wave-trains are key features of South African drought. Dry spells in the summers of 2015, 2016 and 2019 were more intense than 1983 and 1992, as reflected by S-pan potential evaporation measurements >14 mm/day. Despite water deficits, maize yields and river discharge appear stable, due to the uptake of scientific advice and innovative engineering.",Chikoore H.; Jury M.,Journal,Weather and Climate Extremes,2021-09-01,Recinto Universitario de Mayagüez;North-West University;University of Zululand,Drought ;  El Niño ;  Indian ocean dipole ;  Rossby wave trains ;  South Africa
The emergence of peace engineering and innovation,"Peace Engineering and Innovation is an emergent field with the potential to disrupt traditional engineering and management of technology research, education, and practice. Peace Engineering and Innovation is a potential disruption of, and radical innovation in, the meaning of engineering and innovation. Yet the concept, so enthralling, requires analysis of the literature base to facilitate its operationalization. We add to the literature by focusing on the field's works and bifurcating them into two divergent paths. We utilize meta-analysis methodologies and data surface mining to demonstrate the large-scale patterns in the Peace Engineering and Innovation literature. Our findings provide policy makers, educators, students, practitioners, and researchers a knowledge base that is parsed into actionable areas.

University based interdisciplinary space lab: Designing for astronaut health and wellbeing,"The importance of interdisciplinary approaches through collaborative mindset, cross-field knowledge, and co-creative team actions is integral for continuing space exploration success as evidenced by past and ongoing terrestrial space habitat analog missions and extraordinary International Space Station (ISS) achievements. This paper presents the third annual iterative outcomes of an innovative university-based space program using Project Based Learning (PBL) methodology in creating design ideas for astronaut health support and wellbeing during a long duration mission (LDM) for a future inhabited lunar moon base or Mars Mission astronaut transit. University faculties including Built Environment, Industrial Design, Engineering, Science, and Health, at Western Sydney University Australia and supported by University of Houston USA are brought together to develop a new understanding of discipline capabilities with the prospect to co-creatively provide new opportunities and inspiration for teamwork across fields. This is of key interest to employers of new graduates in space or innovation-based industries where human factors and designing for high quality human-centered outcomes supports career resilience through currency, agility, and focus. The altruistic nature of interactions that make the ISS a success on multiple levels across cultural, scientific and humanitarian foundations provide the template for cross-disciplinary inspiration, that leverage synergies, and shared goals unattainable by single fields alone. It is not common for disciplines to work so closely together though industry has an expectation for this knowledge. Previously teams of three (2018); five (2019), and now ten undergraduates in 2020 represent team formation. Student numbers across the design for space theme have grown annually from fifteen, to twenty-five, to forty students in 2020. Now opportunities to respond to the complexities of the project in more detail are presented in addressing the overarching research domains in spatial design, human factors and design for health for LDMs. Team supervisory academic staff grew from 1-to-3 and provided further team guidance and discipline specialisations to inform three iterative project phases across the twelve activity weeks for four teams focusing on human spaceflight, exercise, related design performance and materials, and selected UNSDGs principles. The paper outlines the methodological approach, assessment methods, acculturation to working in teams and immersion in space knowledge for newcomers, and a review of forty collaborative outcomes all conducted by migrating Online during the COVID19 pandemic of 2020 by necessity. Periodic project collaborations with sports and health science, engineering, health informatics, space architects, a former astronaut, a representative from NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) Flight Control, and industrial design academics (project host discipline and non-traditional space area) provided an environment for discussion, development, and co-creative processes that have led to new discoveries and stimuli for new collaboration, international understanding and advancing humankind in space and on earth.",Alexander S.; Bannova O.,Journal,Acta Astronautica,2021-09-01,Western Sydney University;University of Houston,Design ;  Experiential learning ;  Future work ;  Human spaceflight ;  Interdisciplinary
Collaboration potential between low-capacity SMEs and academic researchers determined by symmetry of motivation,"While university-industry collaboration has received widespread attention in academic literature and policy making, there is still limited knowledge on how low-capacity SMEs engage in open innovation activities. Building on a survey conducted among Estonian SMEs with limited innovation capacity, our research focuses specifically on aspects that help low-capacity SMEs and academic researchers to collaborate. The sample was selected purposefully using an innovation voucher database. Our research results indicate that collaboration is fostered by the perceived symmetry of motivation between partners, or paradoxically, the perceived higher motivation of the academic partner rather than the motivation of the SME itself. Our analysis suggests that motivation symmetry between partners plays a crucial role in determining the collaboration process and outcome between low-capacity SMEs and academic researchers.",Rajalo S.; Vadi M.,Journal,Technovation,2021-09-01,Tartu Ülikool,Absorptive capacity ;  Innovation voucher ;  Low-capacity SME ;  Motivation symmetry ;  University-industry collaboration
"‘Gold’, ‘Ribbon’ or ‘Puzzle’: What motivates researchers to work in Research and Technology Organizations","This paper employs the motivational trichotomy of financial rewards, reputational rewards, and intrinsic satisfaction (gold, ribbon, and puzzle) to analyze the role of motivation in the context of research and technology organizations. This research is based on a case study that used an online questionnaire survey of 421 scientists from a large multi-technology Research and Technology Organization. The paper draws from previous work on scientists’ orientations toward outcomes and exploitation of research results and finds that the typology of motivational schemes differ. In the study's context, our analysis did not find advancing academic research to be the main motivator, but rather being able to exploit results. However, within the exploitation mode, the results show that all four factors, gold, challenge, engineering, and basic research, motivate researchers’ activities. The study highlights the Research and Technology Organizations’ differences compared to universities. The findings also suggest that the role of grand societal challenges is emerging as a distinct motivator, aside from a basic research-oriented advancement of science.",Suominen A.; Kauppinen H.; Hyytinen K.,Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2021-09-01,Teknologian Tutkimuskeskus VTT;Tampere University,Knowledge transfer ;  Research and Technology Organizations ;  Research motivation ;  Self-determination theory
Situating innovation policy in Mediterranean Arab countries: A research agenda for context sensitivity,"Innovation policy is embedded in local contexts that shape its courses and outcomes. However, the role of context is often neglected in the design and implementation of innovation policies. Critical questions such as what innovation actually means, what kind of innovation policies may be beneficial in a given country and for specific sectors, regions and actors, and what kinds of policies and programs can help promote innovation in a feasible and effective manner are rarely addressed. Focusing on Mediterranean Arab countries with their political and economic proximity to the EU, this article proposes three conceptual shifts towards a context-sensitive approach to innovation policy design and analysis. Drawing on insights from relational economic geography, interpretive policy analysis, and science and technology studies, the article discusses how these three shifts enable new perspectives on innovation policies in Tunisia, Jordan, and Egypt. The article suggests a research agenda that can stimulate discussion and lead to a new approach in innovation studies and policy for Arab countries in the EU's neighborhood.",Haddad C.; Benner M.,Journal,Research Policy,2021-09-01,European Commission Joint Research Centre;Osterreichische Institut fur Internationale Politik,Innovation policy ;  Institutional context ;  Mediterranean Arab countries ;  Policy transfer ;  Socio-technical understanding of innovation ;  Sociotechnical imaginaries of innovation
Survey on set-based design (SBD) quantitative methods,"Product development efforts now more than ever are in need of methodologies that can address the challenges of increased system complexities, shortening time to market, increased demands in mass customization, market instabilities, geographical barriers, improved innovation, and adaptability to emerging technologies. To address these challenges most companies will need to make key decisions early in the product development life-cycle. In this early phase there are high levels of information uncertainty and information ambiguity. Under these circumstances many companies will converge too early to a point design (Point Based Design—PBD) which will lead to increased cost and schedule delays due to reworking the design later in the product development life cycle. To overcome these challenges many researchers have proposed the Set-Based Design (SBD) methodology. However, there has been limited guidance on how to define, reason, and narrow sets while improving the level of abstraction of the design. To address such concerns, a literature review was conducted. The contributions of this research include: (1) aggregated literature from over 100 sources on quantitative methods (QM) that has not been considered SBD but does support set-based thinking, (2) consolidated body of knowledge on QM to help industrial practitioners implement SBD, (3) ​defined gaps and opportunities for future research, and (4) defined strengths and limitations of QM and techniques to define, reason and narrow sets.",Dullen S.; Verma D.; Blackburn M.; Whitcomb C.,Journal,Systems Engineering,2021-09-01,Systems Engineering Department;Stevens Institute of Technology;Picatinny,design space exploration ;  lean product and process development ;  new product development ;  set-based concurrent engineering ;  set-based design ;  systems engineering ;  trade-off analysis
The nexus between misallocation of land resources and green technological innovation: a novel investigation of Chinese cities,"Abstract: As an important production factor, land resources significantly impact green technology innovation. However, the misallocation of land resources caused by the government's ""second-hand"" land supply strategy has become increasingly prominent, which will adversely affect green technology innovation by affecting the allocation of innovative elements. Based on the research data of 252 cities in China from 2008 to 2017, this paper uses panel space measurement estimation and panel threshold estimation empirical methods to test the theoretical hypothesis of the impact of misallocation of land resources on green technology innovation. The study finds that local or neighboring land resources' misallocation has a hindering effect on local green technology innovation. Furthermore, the misallocation of land resources has a threshold effect on the impact of green technology innovation. The relatively high level of local economic development and environmental regulation reduces the restraining effect of the misallocation of land resources on green technology innovation, and vice versa. Therefore, local governments should optimize the allocation of innovative elements, accelerate the construction of an efficient and market-oriented green technology innovation system, reduce the excessive intervention in land resources, and enhance the vitality of innovation entities to improve the level of green technology innovation.

Optimization on fracturing fluid flowback model after hydraulic fracturing in oil well,"As an important part in the process of hydraulic fracturing, fracturing fluid flowback after fracturing will directly affect the productivity of the fractured wells. It is of great significance to carry out optimization research on the flowback working system of fracturing fluid (the time of flowback beginning and the size of flowback nozzles) to enhance the efficiency of fracturing. At present, researches on optimization model of fracturing fluid flowback have taken into account the effects of fracturing fluid loss and proppant reflux, while ignoring the effects of proppant sedimentation. A new calculation model of proppant regurgitation velocity has been established in recent years, but it is rarely used in the research of flowback working system. This study innovatively integrated the calculation model of modified proppant sedimentation velocity obtained through experiments, the new calculation model of critical proppant regurgitation velocity, and the wellhead pressure calculation model to form a comprehensive flowback model of fracturing fluid. Then coupled with the flowback criteria of quickly flowback, reducing proppant reflux, and maintaining proppant settlement degree (ratio of proppant settlement distance to crack height) less than 60%, an optimization model of fracturing fluid flowback is constructed and realized by MATLAB software programs. The optimization model were verified by four fractured wells in DaQing Oilfield. The effects of reservoir permeability, reservoir porosity, fracturing fluid density, and proppant particle size on wellhead pressure drop, fracturing fluid flowback rate, and proppant settlement degree were calculated and analyzed by using the above flowback model. The verification results show that the simulated wellhead pressure and flowback flowrate are in good agreement with the actual dataset, with the average errors of 11.9% and 11.6% respectively, which proves the accuracy of the flowback optimization model. Parametric analysis shows that, with the increase of reservoir permeability and reservoir porosity, the wellhead pressure drop velocity increases. When the permeability increases from 1mD to 5mD, the flowback rate of fracturing fluid and proppant settlement degree are reduced by 12.3% and 69.8% respectively. When the porosity increases from 9% to 36%, the proppant settlement degree fall by 25.2%. Moreover, the flowback rate of fracturing fluid decreases linearly and the proppant settlement degree increases linearly with the increase of fracturing fluid density; and the proppant settlement degree increases by 3.5 times when the proppant particle size increases from 0.25 mm to 1.65 mm. Therefore, choosing smaller fracturing fluid density and smaller proppant particle size can ensure higher fluid flowback efficiency and lower proppant settlement degree.",Qu Z.; Wang J.; Guo T.; Shen L.; Liao H.; Liu X.; Fan J.; Hao T.,Journal,Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering,2021-09-01,China University of Petroleum (East China);PetroChina Southwest Oil and Gas Field Company,Flowback simulation ;  Fracturing fluid flowback ;  Optimization model ;  Proppant regurgitation ;  Proppant settlement
Review of interdisciplinary heat transfer enhancement technology for nuclear reactor,"All over the world, the nuclear reactor technology has been in the critical stage of transformation and upgrading. Also, there have been the higher requirements for the key technical indicators, such as the power level, the miniaturization and the security. According to analyzing the engineering requirements of typical nuclear reactor devices, the authors demonstrated the scientific problems and the physical mechanisms behind the limitation of thermal-hydraulic parameters, such as the fuel assembly, the steam generator, and the special safe system. Thus, the technical route of heat transfer enhancement was put forward in this paper. The technology of heat transfer enhancement referred to the application of various engineering means to improve the heat transfer performance of component and reduce the power consumption of coolant, the component temperature, as well as the device size. In this paper, the heat transfer enhancement technology was divided into the passive technology and the active technology. Meanwhile, the passive technology could be subdivided into the structure innovation technology and the surface modification technology. The active technology could be subdivided into the magnetic field technology and the electric filed technology. Based on the analyses of this paper, it was considered that the effects of different heat transfer enhancement technologies on the single-phase and two-phase conditions were quite different. Moreover, the corresponding technical development maturity and the manufacturing process were also much different. First of all, the structure innovation technology mainly included two categories: the micro-channel technology and the longitudinal vortex technology. By increasing the specific surface area of thermal component, enhancing the turbulent mixing degree of flow field, and disturbing the near-wall thermal boundary layer, the heat transfer performance of single-phase and two-phase conditions could be significantly improved. The above technology had been widely applied to many heat transfer fields, and the manufacturing technology was mature as well as diversified, which had the strong application prospect in the field of reactor core and heat exchanger without nuclear conditions. It should be noted that the technical difficulty of structure innovation technology lied in the optimization of structure design to obtain the best enhanced heat transfer performance. As for the surface modification technology, it mainly included the surface micro-nano structure technology and the surface coating technology. Moreover, it was suggested that the structural dimensions of above two technologies were far smaller than that of the near-wall thermal boundary layer, and the corresponding effects on the sing-phase heat transfer condition was not obvious. However, the above two technologies could significantly affect the bubble dynamics and the two-phase interface evolution under boiling condition, which could obviously improve the heat transfer performance under two-phase condition. In addition, the magnetic field technology and the electric field technology belonged to the active heat transfer enhancement technology, which relied on the coolant physical properties and the intervention technology of flow field. It should be noted that the above two technologies could effectively improve the heat transfer performance under the single-phase and two-phase conditions. However, this kind of technology was still in the stage of scientific research, and there was no practical engineering application. Based on the current technology development, the application of these two technologies was weak in the reactor core, and the application in non-nuclear environment was also limited.",Lu Q.; Liu Y.; Deng J.; Luo X.; Deng Z.; Mi Z.,Journal,Annals of Nuclear Energy,2021-09-01,China National Nuclear Corporation;Nuclear Power Institute of China;Science and Technology on Reactor System Design Technology Laboratory,Active technology ;  Heat transfer enhancement technology ;  Interdisciplinary ;  Nuclear reactor ;  Passive technology
DoS and DDoS attacks in Software Defined Networks: A survey of existing solutions and research challenges,"Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a new networking paradigm where forwarding hardware is decoupled from control decisions. It promises to dramatically simplify network management and enable innovation and evolution. In SDN, network intelligence is logically centralized in software-based controllers (the control plane), while network devices (OpenFlow Switches) become simple packet-forwarding devices (the data plane) that can be programmed via an open interface (OpenFlow protocol). Such decoupling of the control plane from the data plane introduces various challenges that include security, reliability, load balancing, and traffic engineering. Dreadful security challenges in SDNs are denial of service (DoS) and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. For instance, in SDNs, DoS/DDoS attacks could flood the control plane, the data plane, or the communication channel. Attacking the control plane could result in failure of the entire network, while attacking the data plane or the communication channel results in packet drop and network unavailability. In this paper we deliver several contributions that shed light on the field of DoS/DDoS attacks in SDNs, providing a complete background about the area, including attacks and analysis of the existing solutions. In particular, our contributions can be summarized as follow: we review and systematize the state-of-the-art solutions that address both DoS and DDoS attacks in SDNs through the lenses of intrinsic and extrinsic approaches. Moreover, the discussed countermeasures are organized accordingly to their focus, be it on detection, mitigation, prevention, or graceful degradation. Further, we survey the different approaches and tools adopted to implement the revised solutions. Finally, we also highlight possible future research directions to address DoS/DDoS attacks in SDNs.",Eliyan L.; Di Pietro R.,Journal,Future Generation Computer Systems,2021-09-01,"Hamad Bin Khalifa University, College of Science and Engineering",Attacks ;  DDoS ;  DoS ;  Research challenges ;  SDN ;  Security ;  Survey

Investigating the effect of reverse engineering pedagogy in K-12 robotics education,"The purpose of the study is to explore the effectiveness of reverse engineering pedagogy (REP) and forward project-based pedagogy (FPP) in K-12 robotics education. A two-stage study was conducted in two secondary schools, involving a total of 169 students. Based on the experience of the pilot study (Study 1), we refined the REP and examined its effectiveness through a quasi-experimental design in the formal study (Study 2), which included four teaching models: the Deconstruction Recovery Model, Troubleshooting Model, Element Minitrim Model, and Structural Innovation Model. Results indicated that students in the REP group performed significantly better and perceived a higher degree of compatibility and creative self-efficacy than those in the FPP group, which is consistent with the final robotics product evaluation. However, no significant difference was found in the learning attitude towards the course. The research findings highlight the value of REP in robotics education, especially in cultivating creativity and enhance learning performance, however, it needs reasonable planning and design.",Zhong B.; Kang S.; Zhan Z.,Journal,Computer Applications in Engineering Education,2021-09-01,South China Normal University;Changhe High School,reverse engineering ;  robotics education ;  structural innovation model ;  teaching model ;  troubleshooting model
A Roadmap for Production of Cement and Concrete with Low-CO<inf>2</inf> Emissions,"This review will show that low-CO2 cements can be produced to give superior durability, based on a sound understanding of their microstructure and how it impacts macro-engineering properties. For example, it is essential that aluminium is available in calcium-rich alkali-activated systems to offset the depolymerisation effect of alkali cations on C-(N-)A-S-H gel. The upper limit on alkali cation incorporation into a gel greatly affects mix design and source material selection. A high substitution of cement clinker in low-CO2 cements may result in a reduction of pH buffering capacity, hence susceptibility to carbonation and corrosion of steel reinforcement. With careful mix design, a more refined pore structure and associated lower permeability can still give a highly durable concrete. It is essential to expand thermodynamic databases for current and prospective cementitious materials so that concrete performance and durability can be predicted when using low-CO2 binders. Cationic copolymer and amphoteric plasticisers, when available commercially, will enhance the development of alkali-activated materials. The development of supersonic shockwave reactors will enable the conversion of a wide range of virgin and secondary source materials into cementitious materials, replacing blast furnace slag and coal fly ash that have dwindling supply. A major obstacle to the commercial adoption of low-CO2 concrete is the prescriptive nature of existing standards and design codes, so there is an urgent need to shift towards performance-based standards. The roadmap presented here is not an extension of current cement practice, but a new way of integrating fundamental research, equipment innovation, and commercial opportunity.

A longitudinal study of virtual design studio (VDS) use in STEM distance design education,"The use of virtual design studios (VDS) in practice-based STEM education is increasing but requires further research to inform understanding of student learning and success. This paper presents a longitudinal, large-scale study (3 years, 3000 students) of student behaviour in an online design studio used as part of a distance learning Design and Innovation qualification, within the School of Engineering and Innovation at The Open University (UK). The sample size and time period of the study is unprecedented and provides unique insights into student behaviours. Moderate correlations between overall VDS use and student success were identified in early stages of study but were weaker in later stages. Detailed results identify specific behaviour correlations, such as ‘listening-in’ (viewing other students’ work) and student success, as well as behaviour shifts from ‘passive’ to ‘active’ engagement. Strong intrinsic motivations for engagement were observed throughout and selected social learning mechanisms are presented to explain the empirical results, specifically: social comparison, presence, and communities of practice. The contribution of this paper is the framing of these mechanisms as steps in the longitudinal development of design students in a distance setting, providing an informed basis for the understanding, design, and application of virtual design studios.",Jones D.; Lotz N.; Holden G.,Journal,International Journal of Technology and Design Education,2021-09-01,The Open University,Distance design education ;  Social learning ;  Studio pedagogy ;  VDS ;  Virtual design studio

FUTURE COMPETITION LAW IN INDONESIA: ANALYSIS OF THE PHENOMENON OF DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION,"This research aims to analyze the legal status of disruptive innovation concerning the competition act and outline the policy direction of business competition regulations. In conducting this research, the author uses normative research methods by utilizing secondary data. In recent years, legal issues related to business competition have culminated in the presence of innovations that can change the paradigm of producers and consumers towards market activity habits, which are accustomed to conducting direct transactions. The emergence of modern technology has created a new, fourth industrial revolution that combines automation and computing with the internet of things. Disruptive innovation enables producers to offer their products and services efficiently and effectively through online-based offerings to provide consumers with various product choices to determine their needs efficiently and according to economic capacity. This paradigm shift must be balanced with regulations that can limit the legal corridors that have been adjusted to create prosperity for consumers and producers. It can be concluded that disruptive innovation has made the competition very intensive for consumers, making it easier for them to make choices according to economic capacity. In connection with the legal politics of business competition regulation, the law must be directed as a means of social control and social engineering to make business competition effective and efficient by still paying attention to Article 33 of the 1945 Constitution as the basis for market policy direction.",Al Kautsar I.,Journal,Syariah: Jurnal Hukum dan Pemikiran,2021-08-22,Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta,Competition Act ;  Disruptive Innovation ;  Politic of Laws

Creating a Supportive Space for Teaching-Focused Faculty to Write About their Teaching,"While research institution publication is driven by tenure track faculty, there are instructional innovations occurring in the first-year classrooms that should be published and shared with the community. Instructional faculty often explore new instructional approaches, yet instructors with multiple classes exceeding 100 students or weekly in-class lecture and lab coverage exceeding 25 hours have little time to reflect, research, and publish on their observations and discoveries. Recently, the extreme instructional demands from pandemic management have heightened the awareness and impact of their contributions as many led the charge through innovation and guidance into the immediate transition to the online environment. Coordination with and recognition through the school's Center For Teaching Excellence organization provided the scholarship for teaching and learning (SoTL) grounding and framework. In order for faculty to contribute to the SoTL and publish, they must overcome significant barriers including better understanding of the SoTL landscape, creating support systems to sustain them in a typically isolating writing endeavor, and training in meeting the unique expectations of academic writing. We describe several initiatives implemented at Texas A&M University that specifically address these challenges including community building among engineering education faculty, bringing in engineering education leaders to give seminars and discuss the future of engineering education, and several smaller support groups of faculty focused on either engineering education grant writing, designing and implementing innovative teaching methods, or academic writing in general.

Petri net modeling for ising model formulation in quantum annealing,"Quantum annealing is an emerging new platform for combinatorial optimization, requiring an Ising model formulation for optimization problems. The formulation can be an essential obstacle to the permeation of this innovation into broad areas of everyday life. Our research is aimed at the proposal of a Petri net modeling approach for an Ising model formulation. Although the proposed method requires users to model their optimization problems with Petri nets, this process can be carried out in a relatively straightforward manner if we know the target problem and the simple Petri net modeling rules. With our method, the constraints and objective functions in the target optimization problems are represented as fundamental characteristics of Petri net models, extracted systematically from Petri net models, and then converted into binary quadratic nets, equivalent to Ising models. The proposed method can drastically reduce the difficulty of the Ising model formulation.",Nakamura M.; Kaneshima K.; Yoshida T.,Journal,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),2021-08-02,University of the Ryukyus,Adiabatic quantum optimization ;  Binary quadratic net ;  Ising model ;  Model-based engineering ;  Model-based optimization ;  Petri nets ;  Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization ;  Quantum annealing

PGS/HAp microporous composite scaffold obtained in the TIPS-TCL-SL method: An innovation for bone tissue engineering,"In this research, we synthesize and characterize poly(glycerol sebacate) pre-polymer (pPGS) (1H NMR, FTiR, GPC, and TGA). Nano-hydroxyapatite (HAp) is synthesized using the wet precipitation method. Next, the materials are used to prepare a PGS-based composite with a 25 wt.% addition of HAp. Microporous composites are formed by means of thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) followed by thermal cross-linking (TCL) and salt leaching (SL). The manufactured microporous materials (PGS and PGS/HAp) are then subjected to imaging by means of SEM and µCT for the porous structure characterization. DSC, TGA, and water contact angle measurements are used for further evaluation of the materials. To assess the cytocompatibility and biological potential of PGS-based composites, preosteoblasts and differentiated hFOB 1.19 osteoblasts are employed as in vitro models. Apart from the cytocompatibility, the scaffolds supported cell adhesion and were readily populated by the hFOB1.19 preosteoblasts. HAp-facilitated scaffolds displayed osteoconductive properties, supporting the terminal differentiation of osteoblasts as indicated by the production of alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin and osteopontin. Notably, the PGS/HAp scaffolds induced the production of significant amounts of osteoclastogenic cytokines: IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, which induced scaffold remodeling and promoted the reconstruction of bone tissue. Initial biocompatibility tests showed no signs of adverse effects of PGS-based scaffolds toward adult BALB/c mice.",Piszko P.; Włodarczyk M.; Zielińska S.; Gazińska M.; Płociński P.; Rudnicka K.; Szwed A.; Krupa A.; Grzymajło M.; Sobczak-Kupiec A.; Słota D.; Kobielarz M.; Wojtków M.; Szustakiewicz K.,Journal,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2021-08-02,Politechnika Wrocławska;Politechnika Krakowska;University of Lodz,In vivo biocompatibility ;  Osteoblasts ;  Osteoclastogenic cytokines ;  Osteoconductive ;  Poly(glycerol sebacate) ;  Scaffolds ;  Thermal induced phase separation

Cultures of Engagement and Innovation: Realizing Purdue’s Public Mission of Access and Impact in Engineering Education,"Purdue University’s commitments as a public land grant institution that purposefully integrates education, research, and service has enabled the university to develop as a site of innovation and impact at scale, making strategic investments and taking bold risks that produce benefits within wider social, political, and economic systems. We present a description of Purdue’s culture and processes reflecting a research-practice innovation cycle, illustrated by examples spanning seven decades in the engineering education space where practice is a generative site for emergence of new ideas, and research in turn informs practice. Innovation as part of a research-practice cycle is not undertaken for its own sake, but with meaning and purpose. It keeps in view how to enable infrastructure, how to scale, adapt, and personalize, and how to make education inclusive and global. Innovation at scale requires relationship building and working within institutional cultures, building towards transformation and impact using what is available, with a knowledge of how it can travel on to other destinations",Adams R.; Brightman A.; Deboer J.; Jamieson L.; Oakes W.; Riley D.; Rudin P.,Journal,Advances in Engineering Education,2021-08-01,Purdue University,Innovation ;  Institutional culture ;  Research to practice
How to Teach Engineering Ethics? A Retrospective and Prospective Sketch of TU Delft’s Approach to Engineering Ethics Education,"This paper provides a retrospective and prospective overview of TU Delft’s approach to engineering ethics education. For over twenty years, the Ethics and Philosophy of Technology Section at TU Delft has been at the forefront of engineering ethics education, offering education to a wide range of engineering and design students. The approach developed at TU Delft is deeply informed by the research of the Section, which is centred around Responsible Research and Innovation, Design for Values, and Risk Ethics. These theoretical approaches are premised on the notion that technologies are inherently value-laden, and as such contain the possibility of fostering or hindering moral values. Each of these approaches encourages students to take a proactive attitude with respect to their projects and profession, thinking creatively about – and taking responsibility for – how to both prevent harm and do good via the technologies they help develop. To explain how this is put into practice, this paper sketches a brief history of ethics teaching at TU Delft, outlines current activities, and presents future plans for Bachelor and Master’s level engineering ethics education at TU Delft",Grunsven J.; Marin L.; Stone T.; Roeser S.; Doorn N.,Journal,Advances in Engineering Education,2021-08-01,Delft University of Technology,Ethics ;  Philosophy of engineering education ;  Social responsibility
Offering an Entrepreneurship Course to All Engineering Students: Lessons Learned from ING2030 in Puc-Chile,"Entrepreneurial learning experiences have become one of the key aspects of the state of the art in engineering education. As such, technology-focused entrepreneurship courses have been incorporated to engineering curricula — both in developed and developing countries. Following this trend, the Engineering School at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (PUC-Engineering) designed a third-year compulsory course on research, entrepreneurship, and innovation, whose objective is to provide students with entrepreneurial skills that transcend time. To continuously improve this course, the Engineering Education Unit at PUC-Engineering has been conducting pre- and post-surveys, assessing self-efficacy and learning benefits related to various course methods. This paper describes the main lessons learned as a result of using this data-centric approach throughout the last six academic periods. We found that the course is perceived as beneficial by most of its students, and that project feedback sessions and project presentations report the highest perceived learning benefits. Besides, we describe some of the improvements to the course that have been pushed by assessment data, showing the importance of using a data-driven approach for engineering entrepreneurship education.",Hilliger I.; Fleet C.; Melian C.; Baier J.; Pérez-Sanagustín M.,Journal,Advances in Engineering Education,2021-08-01,Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile;Université Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier,Assessment ;  Engineering curriculum ;  Entrepreneurship

Towards Trace-Graphs for Data-driven Test Case Mining in the Domain of Automated Driving,"Technological innovations in data science and artificial intelligence research have led to increasing task automation in autonomous driving. Currently, most test engineering processes in the industry are based on manual test case specification and the accumulation of certain test mile thresholds. This test engineering is very cost-and time-consuming. But especially the test case specification and selection is influenced by human bias. A promising potential approach to overcome those drawbacks is data-driven test case mining based on big data of sensor/actor recordings from real driving situations. The key challenge for data-driven test case mining, is handling the huge amount of data generated by the car sensors related to the open-world context of autonomous driving. This paper presents a novel data-driven approach to quantify events and situations which occur during recorded test drives by transforming multivariate time series data into a condensed, directed graph. This graphical model makes such events and situations comparable and enables the application of established coverage criteria and thus supports statistical statements regarding the coverage of potentially infinite operating environments. To illustrate the benefits of this approach, we conducted a quantitative evaluation in an industrial context in the domain of automated driving, including over 1000 km of field data. The overall results prove that a significant amount of the data characteristics do not get lost during the Graph transformation.",Metzger N.; Hoffmann L.; Bartelt C.; Stuckenschmidt H.; Wommer M.; Del Castillo M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 3rd IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Testing, AITest 2021",2021-08-01,Robert Bosch GmbH;Universität Mannheim,Automated Driving ;  Data-driven Testing ;  Safety Evaluation ;  Time Series Analysis

Deliberations on natural products and future directions in the pharmaceutical industry,"Natural Products (NPs) are molecular 'special equipment' that impart survival benefits on their producers in nature. Due to their evolved functions to modulate biology these privileged metabolites are substantially represented in the drug market and are continuing to contribute to the discovery of innovative medicines such as the recently approved semi-synthetic derivative of the bacterial alkaloid staurosporin in oncology indications. The innovation of low molecular weight compounds in modern drug discovery is built on rapid progress in chemical, molecular biological, pharmacological and data sciences, which together provide a rich understanding of disease-driving molecular interactions and how to modulate them. NPs investigated in these pharmaceutical research areas create new perspectives on their chemical and biological features and thereby new chances to advance medical research. New methods in analytical chemistry linked with searchable NP-databases solved the issue of reisolation and enabled targeted and efficient access to novel molecules from nature. Cheminformatics delivers high resolution descriptions of NPs and explores the substructures that systematically map NP-chemical space by sp3-enriched fragments. Whole genome sequencing has revealed the existence of collocated gene clusters that form larger functional entities together with proximate resistance factors thus avoiding self-inhibition of the encoded metabolites. The analysis of bacterial and fungal genes provides tantalizing glimpses of new compound-target pairs of therapeutic value. Furthermore, a dedicated investigation of structurally unique, selectively active NPs in chemical biology demonstrates their extraordinary power as shuttles between new biological target spaces of pharmaceutical relevance.",Buntin K.; Ertl P.; Hoepfner D.; Krastel P.; Oakeley E.; Pistorius D.; Schuhmann T.; Wong J.; Petersen F.,Journal,Chimia,2021-08-01,Novartis International AG,Analytical chemistry ;  Chemical diversity ;  Drug discovery ;  Genetic engineering ;  Heterologous expression ;  Natural products ;  Natural products fragments ;  Target identification ;  Whole genome sequencing

Smart surveying and mapping: fundamental issues and research agenda,"Surveying and mapping production and services are facing many new problems such as real-time data acquisition, automation of information processing, and intellectualization of service applications. The main reason is that digital surveying and mapping involves complex algorithms and models as the core, and it is often impossible to use simple algorithms and models to completely describe and express the diverse, multi-dimensional and dynamic real world, which makes it difficult to address high-dimensional, nonlinear spatial problems. In order to address this challenge, it is necessary to explore the use of natural intelligence in surveying and mapping, and develop smart surveying and mapping technologies guided by knowledge and based on algorithms. This paper first discusses the basic concepts and ideas of smart surveying and mapping and then analyzes and points out the three basic problems of smart surveying and mapping, including the analysis and modeling of natural intelligence in surveying and mapping, the construction and realization of hybrid intelligent computing paradigm, and the mechanism and path of empowering production. The main directions for further development in the near future are then proposed, including the construction of knowledge system of smart surveying and mapping, research of technology methods, research and development of application systems and instrument equipment. In order to effectively promote scientific research and engineering applications in this area, efforts should be placed on top-level designing, promoting interdisciplinary collaborative innovation and industry-university-research cooperation, and creating good development environments.",Chen J.; Liu W.; Wu H.; Li S.; Yan L.,Journal,Cehui Xuebao/Acta Geodaetica et Cartographica Sinica,2021-08-01,National Geomatics Center of China;Toronto Metropolitan University;Wuhan University,Digitalization ;  Hybrid intelligent computing ;  Knowledge-guided ;  Natural intelligence ;  Smart ;  Surveying and mapping
Development and preliminary application of a simulation test system for frost penetration tunnel evolution,"A model test system for simulating the evolution of frost penetration tunnels was developed to reveal the penetration mechanism and the formation of the frozen surrounding rock in cold regions with negative annual average temperature, and to investigate the thawing mechanism of the frozen surrounding rock due to global warming. The model test system mainly consists of a tunnel model, a ground temperature control system, a climate control system, and a data measurement and acquisition system. The main innovations of the test system are as follows:(1) The model test system can greatly shorten the test period for simulating the tunnel life-cycle temperature field, reducing the original test period from 40 days to 4 days. (2) The new climate simulation system can stably simulate the influence of the annual average temperature, the temperature amplitude, the wind speed and other combined conditions on the tunnel temperature field for a long period of time. (3) The developed ground temperature measuring and controlling system effectively solves the difficulties in data measurement and ground temperature control. The accuracy and reliability of the model test system were verified by comparing the tested temperature field with the field test result of a typical cold region tunnel. The preliminary test results show that, when the annual average temperature is -4 ℃, the frozen envelope of the surrounding rock will gradually advance along the longitudinal direction of the tunnel and penetrate into the deep of the surrounding rock on the cross section, causing the frost penetration of the surrounding rock and hence, forming so-called frost penetration tunnel. The experimental system, filling in the blank of the experimental study on the evolution law of the temperature field under the life-cycle operation condition of tunnels in cold regions, plays a positive role in promoting the frontier research of tunnel engineering in cold regions in China and provides experimental basis for the""one belt, one road""project and the Sichuan-Tibet railway project.",Xia C.; Lin Z.; Shi J.; Du S.,Journal,Yanshilixue Yu Gongcheng Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Rock Mechanics and Engineering,2021-08-01,"Key Laboratory of Geotechnical and Underground Engineering, Ministry of Education;Tongji University;Shaoxing University",Cold region ;  Frost penetration tunnel ;  Temperature field ;  Test system ;  Tunnelling engineering

Frontier nonequilibrium materials science enabled by ultrafast electron methods,"Abstract: Most innovation in materials science and engineering resides in our ability to understand and control the intimate relationship between the structure of materials and their properties. Conventionally, the only route to discovering innovative new material properties has been to explore the structural and compositional phase space that is accessible at (or near) thermodynamic equilibrium. The characterization, manipulation and, ultimately, control of material properties far from equilibrium offers almost completely untapped possibilities for uncovering novel states and phases of materials. Investigations of materials far from equilibrium require the development of new techniques, which are capable of following dynamic processes in materials with extreme spatiotemporal resolution. Thus, ultrafast electron-based methods have become a major new frontier in materials science due to the capability of following dynamics on time scales as short as femtoseconds with the high spatial resolution and sensitivity afforded by electrons. The articles in this issue provide an exciting cross section of the novel research directions that have been enabled at this frontier. Imaging on ultrafast time scales carries critical information on phase transitions, fundamental processes involved in light-harvesting, magnetic, and plasmonic dynamics, the coupling of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom in materials and has revealed previously hidden, nonequilibrium metastable states of matter that have no equilibrium analog.

Gender-based violence in higher education and research: A European perspective,"The gender gap in science is intrinsically linked to gender-based violence in academia. Gender-based violence is a form of discrimination against women that occurs in an academic environment, and it often takes the form of sexual harassment. Some European countries, such as France, Italy, and Ireland, have solid legal systems in place to address sexual harassment in academia. However, as the report of the European Research Area and Innovation Committee Standing Working Group on sexual harassment points out, not all European countries have legislation in this area, or if they do, it is often ineffective. While national surveys generally show that it is difficult to prevent or combat sexual harassment in universities, practices related to corporate social responsibility could be used to start the conversation about the social responsibility of universities to fight against sexual harassment, which is reflected in this article.",Bosco Damous L.; Guillopé C.,Journal,Pure and Applied Chemistry,2021-08-01,Université Paris Nanterre,compliance ;  gender gap ;  gender gap in science ;  gender-based violence ;  higher education and research ;  science ;  sexual harassment ;  STEM
Research hotspots and frontiers of product R&D management under the background of the digital intelligence era-bibliometrics based on citespace and histcite,"The rise of “cloud-computing, mobile-Internet, Internet of things, big-data, and smart-data” digital technology has brought a subversive revolution to enterprises and consumers’ traditional patterns. Product research and development has become the main battlefield of enterprise competition, facing an environment where challenges and opportunities coexist. Regarding the concepts and methods of product R&D projects, the domestic start was later than the international ones, and many domestic companies have also used successful foreign cases as benchmarks to innovate their management methods in practice. “Workers must first sharpen their tools if they want to do their jobs well”. This article will start from the relevant concepts of product R&D projects and summarize current R&D management ideas and methods. We combined the bibliometric analysis software Histcite and Citespace to sort out the content of domestic and foreign literature and explore the changing trends of research hotspots. Finally, combined with the analysis of confirmed cases in domestic masters and doctoral dissertations to test the theory, the literature review of the product R&D project management theme was carried out from the dual perspectives of comprehensive theory and practice. This study uses the core collection library of Web of Science as the object of document extraction. Based on the search conditions of “Product development” or “Intergrat* product development”, 8998 sample documents were initially retrieved. The search deadline was June 2019, with a time range from 2000 to June 2019. Then, using the record number of 50 as the critical condition, 5007 analysis samples were deleted, refined, and cleaned. Through the review and measurement of 5007 papers, the analysis showed that: (1) in the last ten years, sustainability, consumer focus, new approaches to product development management, and organizational design have become critical considerations in the product development process stage; (2) at this stage, researchers are paying more attention to the innovation, design, product development, identification, simultaneous engineering, consequence, and stage/gate model aspects of product development; and (3) factors such as long development cycles, high costs, and poor organizational design are now common problems in the product development process.",Liu H.; Luo Y.; Geng J.; Yao P.,Journal,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),2021-08-01,Tongji University;Shanghai University;Shanghai International Studies University,Digital intelligence era ;  Document metrology ;  Informetrics ;  Product R&D management ;  Scientometrics ;  Web of science

The impact of lockdown timing on COVID-19 transmission across US counties,"Background: Many countries have implemented lockdowns to reduce COVID-19 transmission. However, there is no consensus on the optimal timing of these lockdowns to control community spread of the disease. Here we evaluated the relationship between timing of lockdowns, along with other risk factors, and the growth trajectories of COVID-19 across 3,112 counties in the US. Methods: We ascertained dates for lockdowns and implementation of various non-pharmaceutical interventions at a county level and merged these data with those of US census and county-specific COVID-19 daily cumulative case counts. We then applied a Functional Principal Component (FPC) analysis on this dataset to generate FPC scores, which were used as a surrogate variable to describe the trajectory of daily cumulative case counts for each county. We used machine learning methods to identify risk factors including the timing of lockdown that significantly influenced the FPC scores. Findings: We found that the first eigen-function accounted for most (>92%) of the variations in the daily cumulative case counts. The impact of lockdown timing on the total daily case count of a county became significant beginning approximately 7 days prior to that county reporting at least 5 cumulative cases of COVID-19. Delays in lockdown implementation after this date led to a rapid acceleration of COVID-19 spread in the county over the first ~50 days from the date with at least 5 cumulative cases, and higher case counts across the entirety of the follow-up period. Other factors such as total population, median family income, Gini index, median age, and within-county mobility also had a substantial effect. When adjusted for all these factors, the timing of lockdowns was the most significant risk factor associated with the county-specific daily cumulative case counts. Interpretation: Lockdowns are an effective way of controlling the spread of COVID-19 in communities. Significant delays in lockdown cause a dramatic increase in the cumulative case counts. Thus, the timing of the lockdown relative to the case count is an important consideration in controlling the pandemic in communities. Funding: The study period is from June 2020 to July 2021.

Development of online learning platform for thai university students,"—It is very challenging to regulate emerging innovations in the rapid evolution of online education, especially during the pandemic of Covid-19. Modern online learning systems must take both educational and technological factors into account. For learning purposes, universities have attempted to facilitate their students with online learning practices and phases using emerging technologies. In this study, the online student platform for humanities and social sciences students (HUSO-OPS) was developed using the user-centric, TPACK, and V-model design. Especially, the V-model mostly focused on the field of app engineering online learning network coordination. The 5-axis framework was to enhance the TPACK model to address online learning in more detail about pedagogy, content, movement technology, and the learner profile. The development also concerns the content as well as the context of learning. This research demonstrates the outstanding use of the HUSO-OPS platform during the global pandemic of Covid-19. They explain the different factors involved and the successful interconnections needed for optimum and efficient online learning implementation. The balance of the five parts on the online learning platform in design or consultation is a plural reflection matter.",Chansanam W.; Tuamsuk K.; Poonpon K.; Ngootip T.,Journal,International Journal of Information and Education Technology,2021-08-01,Khon Kaen University,Digital learning ;  Higher education ;  Online learning platform
Asymmetric inter-linkages between green technology innovation and consumption-based carbon emissions in BRICS countries using quantile-on-quantile framework,"The role of reliable Carbon emission measures and relevant climate policy is imperative in realizing Sustainable Development Goals. A large extent of the literature concludes the emissions-mitigating effect of green innovations in a linear framework and ignored structural changes, technological revolutions, and socio-economic reforms that create non-linearity. Apart from that, there is a murky relationship between emissions and green innovation, where two-way links exist between both variables. Therefore, this study draws the inter-linkages between green technology innovation (GI) and carbon emissions (consumption-based and terrestrial emissions) in BRICS countries using monthly data from 1990 to 2017. Our preliminary findings strictly reject the preposition of data normality and highlight that the observed relationship is quantile-dependent. Therefore, a complete set of non-linear modeling is employed that included; Quantile unit root, Quantile cointegration, Quantile causality, and Quantile on Quantile regression to unveil hidden unit root, cointegration, causality, and association between variables. The results exhibit that the emissions-mitigating effect of GI is only pronounced at higher emissions quantiles in Brazil, China, India, and Russia, whereas at lower emissions quantile, GI is weekly or positively linked with carbon emissions. On the flipside, higher carbon emissions instigate GI across medium to higher emissions quantiles in Brazil, China, and India. Unlike them, Russia produces different outcomes, where higher emissions are associated with lower GI across all quantiles. The overall results suggest that GI (carbon emissions) mitigate (instigate) carbon emissions (GI) when a country is embodied with higher level of emissions.",Razzaq A.; Wang Y.; Chupradit S.; Suksatan W.; Shahzad F.,Journal,Technology in Society,2021-08-01,"The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen;Guangdong University of Petrochemical Technology;Ilma University;Chulabhorn Royal Academy;Dalian University of Technology;Chiang Mai University",BRICS ;  Consumption-based carbon emissions ;  Green innovation ;  Quantile on quantile ;  Terrestrial-based carbon emissions
Bi-layered Composite Scaffold for Repair of the Osteochondral Defects,"Objective: Osteochondral defect presents a big challenge for clinical treatment. This study aimed at constructing a bi-layered composite chitosan/chitosan-β-tricalcium phosphate (CS/CS-β-TCP) scaffold and at repairing the rat osteochondral defect. Approach: The bi-layered CS/CS-β-TCP scaffold was fabricated by lyophilization, and its microstructure was observed by a scanning electron microscope. Chondrocytes and bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) were seeded into the CS layer and the CS-β-TCP layer, respectively. Viability and proliferation ability of the cells were observed under a confocal microscope. After subcutaneous implantation, the chondrogenic ability of the CS layer and osteogenic ability of the CS-β-TCP layer were evaluated by immunofluorescence. Then, the bi-layered scaffolds were implanted into the rat osteochondral defects and the harvested samples were macroscopically and histologically evaluated. Results: The bi-layered CS/CS-β-TCP scaffold exhibited the distinctive microstructures for each layer. The seeded chondrocytes in the CS layer could maintain the chondrogenic lineage, whereas BMSCs in the CS-β-TCP layer could continually differentiate into the osteogenic lineage. Moreover, cells in both layers could maintain well viability and excellent proliferation ability. For the in vivo study, the newly formed tissues in the bi-layered scaffolds group were similar with the native osteochondral tissues, which comprised hyaline-like cartilage and subchondral bone, with better repair effects compared with those of the pure CS group and the blank control group. Innovation: This is the first time that the bi-layered composite CS/CS-β-TCP scaffold has been fabricated and evaluated with respect to osteochondral defect repair. Conclusion: The bi-layered CS/CS-β-TCP scaffolds could facilitate osteochondral defect repair and might be the promising candidates for osteochondral tissue engineering.",Xu D.; Cheng G.; Dai J.; Li Z.,Journal,Advances in Wound Care,2021-08-01,Wuhan University;Wenzhou Medical University,bi-layered scaffold ;  chitosan ;  osteochondral defect ;  β-tricalcium phosphate
Will researching digital technology really empower green development?,"The information industry has become a “new engine” driving the growth of the world economy. However, there are many controversies about whether digital technology can reduce the intensity of carbon emissions. Based on OECD data, KPWW method and multiple panel regression, this paper explores the impact and mechanism of digital technology innovation and technology spillover to the domestic carbon emission intensity. Through impulse response analysis and variance decomposition, the comprehensive impact of digital technology on carbon intensity is clarified. This paper concludes that technology innovation in the information industry will increase the intensity of carbon emissions, while cross-industry technology spillovers are persistent for reducing the intensity of domestic carbon emissions. Since the emission reduction effect of technology spillover is greater than the emission increase effect of technology innovation, the digital technology would empower domestic green development. Increasing the proportion of non-fossil energy use and optimizing the industrial structure are effective mechanisms for digital technology innovation to reduce carbon emission intensity.",Wang L.; Chen Y.; Ramsey T.; Hewings G.,Journal,Technology in Society,2021-08-01,China Three Gorges University;University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,Carbon emission intensity ;  Digital technology ;  Technology spillover

Effects of technological distance on innovation performance under heterogeneous technological orientations,"Research and development (R&D) collaborations are assumed to be important means by which firms facilitate innovation performance; however, collaborations with different kinds of partners may yield different innovation outputs. Building on the knowledge-based view (KBV) and the behavioural theory of the firm, this paper investigates the effects of technologically short-distance R&D collaborations and technologically long-distance R&D collaborations on focal firms’ innovation performance. The relative magnitudes of these effects shift once the internal technological orientations (i.e., technological breadth and depth) of focal firms are taken into account. The results from a quantitative data set of 203 international new-energy automotive public enterprises indicate that short-distance R&D collaborations are better for the innovation performance of high-breadth & high-depth firms and high-breadth & low-depth firms. However, collaborating with long-distance partners is better for the innovation performance of low-breadth & high-depth firms. No significant difference was found between the two kinds of collaborations for low-breadth & low-depth firms. The findings have managerial implications for how firms can effectively select partners to improve their innovation performance.",Zhu S.; Hagedoorn J.; Zhang S.; Liu F.,Journal,Technovation,2021-08-01,"United Nations University – Maastricht Economic and Social Research Institute on Innovation and Technology;Royal Holloway, University of London;Dalian University of Technology",Behavioural theory ;  Knowledge-based view ;  Technological breadth ;  Technological depth ;  Technologically long-distance collaboration ;  Technologically short-distance collaboration
Are living labs effective? Exploring the evidence,"The main question addressed in this article is whether the evidence that is publicly available validates the claim that Living Labs are an effective means for promoting innovation. Owing to widespread promotion of their usefulness as a practical tool for pursuing innovation, Living Labs have enjoyed increasing attention from researchers, policy-makers and practitioners. But despite the booming interest in Living Labs – where innovation is generally perceived as taking place in real-life environments – their actual performance remains under-researched. It has yet to be demonstrated whether, in practice, Living Labs speed up the design of ‘solutions’ to societal challenges or the sharing of user value. This study aims to assess the existing evidence about whether they really deliver. A broadly based literature review was conducted to discover whether those initiating Living Labs report success – achieving the objectives/benefits they set themselves. Conclusions are drawn about whether the evidence is, at present, strong enough to warrant the promotion this approach receives. We suggest that, despite their 20-year history, the operationalisation of and outcomes from Living Labs are still poorly understood owing to paucity of published evidence, compounded by inadequate research design and insufficient attention to implementing and reporting performance evaluations.",Paskaleva D.; Cooper D.,Journal,Technovation,2021-08-01,Eclipse Research Consultants;Alliance Manchester Business School,Benefits ;  Characteristics ;  Evaluation ;  Innovation ;  Literature review ;  Living labs
Digital Twin Research in the AECO-FM Industry,"The purpose of this paper is to examine and discuss the current patterns, gaps and trends in Digital Twin research in the architectural, engineering, construction, operation, and facility management (AECO-FM) industry and to propose future directions for industry stakeholders. A bibliometric search was performed on 197 papers that were obtained from the Scopus database. 151 of those papers were used in the subsequent scientometric analysis and mapping to narrate the evolution of the research subject. The studies discussed in the paper cover a wide range of research from model-based information management to building information management, all the way to the interaction between buildings and smart cities. The ‘virtual-physical building integration’, ‘building lifecycle management’, and ‘information integrated production’ subjects are highly in the focus of the research field. While ‘information-based predictive management’ and ‘virtual-based information utilization’ studies need to be addressed for a holistic Digital Twin adoption in the AECO-FM industry. Future studies should focus on the full integration of digital twin and its physical counterpart for better performance throughout the building life cycle. This study highlights the patterns, gaps and trends in Digital Twin research in the AECO-FM industry and contributes to the state-of-the-art digitalization and automation approaches in the construction project management body of knowledge.

Digitalization priorities of quality control processes for SMEs: a conceptual study in perspective of Industry 4.0 adoption,"Digitalization is an opportunity for manufacturing SMEs to transform, not only for the flexibility and agility, but also for improved responsiveness in meeting customer requirements. Quality, being an integral part of customer-orientation, needs to be at the forefront of transformation under digitalization. Also, the digitalization is the need of the hour for continuous improvement to avoid disparity between paper-based quality practices and the digitalized engineering value chain. In this research article, authors intend to address the digitalization priorities of quality practices for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in perspective of adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies. From the literature survey, authors observed that, there is extensive literature available regarding quality and its relevance for continuous improvement, while research insights regarding integration of quality practices in a digital environment are limited and even if considered, they have not been studied holistically. Authors have examined the available research to assimilate the effect of current market trends on quality practices. They have undertaken a survey of prevailing quality maturity in manufacturing SMEs. In current study, authors have understood the need of digitalization of quality processes and propose the priority digital approaches that can guide SMEs with a holistic view of transformation including quality. The key findings based on proposed approaches for adopting digital quality processes are: Firstly, to address the challenges of shorter time-to-market, increased complexity, flexibility and innovation, SMEs need to adopt digitalization across the PDCA quality cycle. Secondly, digitalization of quality practices needs to be considered holistically across value chain. Thirdly, five processes have been prioritized for digitalization based on their adoption maturity i.e. design for quality, compliance, incoming & outgoing goods control, statistical process control and complaint management. Based on finding of this study authors recommend that manufacturing SMEs take cognizance of these findings and adopt digital quality to successfully thrive in the emerging global market.",Dutta G.; Kumar R.; Sindhwani R.; Singh R.,Journal,Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing,2021-08-01,"Amity University;Management Development Institute, Gurgaon",Digitalization ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Integration ;  PDCA ;  Quality ;  SME

What can nuclear engineers learn from design research? A review of the theory and evidence from contemporary American and French nuclear reactor design projects,"Although nuclear reactor design is recognized as an essential skill and intellectual output of academic nuclear engineering, little attention has been paid within the discipline to the structure of the reactor design process and factors influencing design outcomes. This paper, which marks the first systematic attempt to explore the structure of the reactor design process and choices, applies methodological and theoretical tools developed within the mechanical engineering design studies field to the study of nuclear reactor design. Academic nuclear engineering texts frequently describe reactor design as a linear-analytic process of problem decomposition and solution. This paper challenges this long-held view of reactor design to show that it is not the strictly linear-analytic exercise described in nuclear engineering textbooks. This argument is made by comparing and contrasting three views of design: those reported in the literature on design studies, those reported in academic nuclear engineering textbooks and finally, those reported by practitioner reactor designers. The empirical section of this paper that describes the approaches taken by practitioner reactor designers draws on in-depth, semi-structured interviews with designers from 27 American and 5 French contemporary reactor design projects to retrospectively construct the structure of the respective design processes. This empirical evidence reveals that the identity and expertise of the designer as well as the site of the design work bear on the structure of the design process and its outcomes. This work finds that experienced designers based in large companies are more likely to embark on design projects that improve upon previous, internally developed designs. Less experienced designers, typically based in startups are likely to inherently value novelty, with startup designs originating in university settings most likely to develop wholly novel reactor concepts. Specifically, this paper shows that designers who are able to achieve this novelty do so by reframing the purpose of the new reactor design and adopting a position of critique relative to previous designs. This paper thus problematizes the notion of ‘expertise’ in the area of reactor design. To the extent that novelty is a valued outcome of the reactor design process, this paper shows that it is the less experienced designers who are more likely to achieve it. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of social determinants of design outcomes, such as the site of the design activity and the expertise of the reactor designer, particularly in the early, critical stages of design, and point to the need for a richer understanding within nuclear engineering of the design process that goes beyond the long-held analytical view. A deeper understanding of these determinants of design outcomes is likely to yield valuable insights for practice, pedagogical purposes, as well as for the implementation of policies concerning research and development in the nuclear energy sector.",Verma A.,Journal,Nuclear Engineering and Design,2021-08-01,John F.

Technological development of E&P companies in developing countries: An integrative approach to define and prioritize customized elements of technological capability in EOR,"The present study focuses on the Technological Capability development of Exploration and Production companies of developing countries in Enhanced Oil Recovery. EOR is one of the most important issues that the Oil industry faces, and improving TC of oil-rich developing countries which have large oil and gas reserves is of great importance to the future of the world's energy. Some new approaches were used in this study to raise the practicality of the research: Elements of TC were extracted in a customized way using Thematic Analysis and integration of TC and EOR functions and then, as for resource constraints of developing countries for managing technological change, the customized elements were prioritized using the fuzzy AHP method. Upstream oil experts of Iran were used since Iran, as a developing oil-producing country with large oil and gas resources and long history in the oil industry, is considered as a perfect case for this research. The priorities showed the following are the most essential elements of improving TC in the EOR sector: training, the expertise of geophysics specialists and reservoir engineers, environmental considerations, R&D in designing the best method of EOR, governmental policies and incentives, linkage with suppliers and global value chain of oil, geological and reservoir data processing ability, suitable seismic equipment, reservoir and production engineering knowledge stock, and inward technology and knowledge transfer.",Tarighi S.; Shavvalpour S.,Journal,Resources Policy,2021-08-01,Iran University of Science and Technology,Customized elements ;  EOR ;  Technological capability ;  Technological development ;  Upstream Oil industry
A review of the recent trends on core structures and impact response of sandwich panels,"It is a challenging task to advance the excellent strength and structural performance of sandwich structures, while continuing to reduce the weight and cost parameters. Thousands of researchers have studied and developed the core structural innovation with periodical achievements. This review paper concentrates on the core structural trends and impact response of sandwich panels, which highlights the novel design concepts and impact failure modes. Three kinds of core structures have been classified, which are foam-core, two- and three-dimensional periodic cores. It is shown that the core structure of sandwich panels plays a vital role in structural performance and applications. Three common types of loading conditions have been considered, i.e. compression, projectile impact and three-point bending. Examples of novel core structures are further studied and summarised under corresponding impact loadings. Recent applications of sandwich structures are briefly concentrated on aerospace, automotive, marine and civil engineering areas. Furthermore, future research and development prospect of sandwich structures are suggested and predicted.",Ma Q.; Rejab M.; Siregar J.; Guan Z.,Journal,Journal of Composite Materials,2021-08-01,Universiti Malaysia Pahang Al-Sultan Abdullah;University of Liverpool;Ningxia University,bending impact ;  compression ;  core structure ;  impact response ;  Sandwich panel ;  velocity impact
The Impact of Alliances on Knowledge Growth within Firms,"How do alliances lead to knowledge growth and learning for parent firms? Prior research focuses on knowledge inflows from a partner when a firm enters into an alliance. In this paper, we examine factors that enable firms to make better use of their own knowledge and capabilities as a consequence of alliances. To demonstrate the latter dimension of knowledge growth, we depart from prior research that has focused on cross citations of patents between partners, and instead a study self-citation activity. We examine the effect of four factors on self-citations, each of which reflects distinct learning mechanisms and cooperative dynamics, namely knowledge inflows from the alliance partner, knowledge outflows to the alliance partner, partner characteristics, and alliance governance. Results suggest that knowledge inflows from the partner were positively associated with changes in self-citations in alliance domains, whereas knowledge outflows to the partner had a positive impact on changes in self-citations for the smaller firm in the alliance. In contrast, firm specific knowledge possessed by the partner and equity governance had a negative impact on changes in self-citations in alliance domains. This paper develops a fuller understanding of the learning effects of alliances by highlighting that apart from better utilization of the partner's capabilities, alliances also lead to enhanced utilization of the firm's own knowledge and capabilities in further innovative activity.",Giura S.; Kumar S.,Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2021-08-01,Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute;SUNY Oneonta,Evolutionary theory ;  innovation management ;  learning ;  patents ;  strategic alliances ;  technology alliances technology strategy
Global minimum estimates of children affected by COVID-19-associated orphanhood and deaths of caregivers: a modelling study,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic priorities have focused on prevention, detection, and response. Beyond morbidity and mortality, pandemics carry secondary impacts, such as children orphaned or bereft of their caregivers. Such children often face adverse consequences, including poverty, abuse, and institutionalisation. We provide estimates for the magnitude of this problem resulting from COVID-19 and describe the need for resource allocation. Methods: We used mortality and fertility data to model minimum estimates and rates of COVID-19-associated deaths of primary or secondary caregivers for children younger than 18 years in 21 countries. We considered parents and custodial grandparents as primary caregivers, and co-residing grandparents or older kin (aged 60–84 years) as secondary caregivers. To avoid overcounting, we adjusted for possible clustering of deaths using an estimated secondary attack rate and age-specific infection–fatality ratios for SARS-CoV-2. We used these estimates to model global extrapolations for the number of children who have experienced COVID-19-associated deaths of primary and secondary caregivers. Findings: Globally, from March 1, 2020, to April 30, 2021, we estimate 1 134 000 children (95% credible interval 884 000–1 185 000) experienced the death of primary caregivers, including at least one parent or custodial grandparent. 1 562 000 children (1 299 000–1 683 000) experienced the death of at least one primary or secondary caregiver. Countries in our study set with primary caregiver death rates of at least one per 1000 children included Peru (10·2 per 1000 children), South Africa (5·1), Mexico (3·5), Brazil (2·4), Colombia (2·3), Iran (1·7), the USA (1·5), Argentina (1·1), and Russia (1·0). Numbers of children orphaned exceeded numbers of deaths among those aged 15–50 years. Between two and five times more children had deceased fathers than deceased mothers. Interpretation: Orphanhood and caregiver deaths are a hidden pandemic resulting from COVID-19-associated deaths. Accelerating equitable vaccine delivery is key to prevention. Psychosocial and economic support can help families to nurture children bereft of caregivers and help to ensure that institutionalisation is avoided. These data show the need for an additional pillar of our response: prevent, detect, respond, and care for children.

Identifying Signature Pedagogies in a Multidisciplinary Engineering Program,"This work-in-progress is part of a larger research and evaluation project designed to realign program goals with teaching and learning practices in a large, multi-disciplinary engineering science program at a research-oriented Canadian university. The ultimate goal of this work is to define and develop a set of key teaching and learning practices that reflect program goals and future directions. Drawing from Shulman's work on signature pedagogies, which are defined as the modes of teaching and learning that are unique to a particular discipline or profession, this paper presents the qualitative analysis of a series of semi-structured interviews with program faculty and alumni. Teaching for depth and breadth were found to differentiate teaching in engineering science compared to other engineering disciplines. However, some tensions were identified between instructors and alumni in the use of foundational theories and understanding the significance of it to real world practice. For example, while instructors linked a first-principles approach to innovation, this link was not reported by alumni. This study highlights the tensions and challenges in the process of framing and defining the signature pedagogy for a multidisciplinary program, and sets the stage for further work on improving coherence between program goals, practices and outcomes.",Moozeh K.; Romkey L.; Dawe N.; Khan R.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,University of Toronto,
Factors Associated with Collaboration Networks in ASEE Conference Papers,"Research collaborations are essential to advance rigorous scholarship, perform transformative science, and accelerate engineering education innovation. With this in mind, the engineering education community should continue investigating and evaluating the key factors that hinder or promote collaborative research within and across institutions, especially amidst efforts to continue to grow the field. Over the last few decades, research collaborations across institutions have grown significantly-however, few studies have examined the relationship between such collaborations and the institutional characteristics such as ranking, geographic location, or classifications (e.g., the Carnegie Classification of Higher Education Institutions) when studying collaboration networks. Our paper uses social network analysis (SNA) to help fill this gap by examining how some of these institutional characteristics are related to the institutions' collaborations and network positions. Social network analysis has emerged as a useful approach to measure research collaboration by evaluating several types of collaboration networks, including co-authorship networks. In this paper, we consider the institution network. Nodes in this type of network represent institutions, while links represent the pairwise collaboration between two institutions. Each link also has a weight that represents the collaboration frequency. Thus, the links form a social space that we can map and analyze to reveal systematic patterns in the broader engineering education community that might otherwise pass unobserved. We collected information about all papers published between 1996 and 2020 in the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) annual conference proceedings for this study. We built the inter-institutional collaboration network and identified structural network properties, connected components, and modularity classes from this dataset. The network data were then linked to data regarding each institution's (i) Carnegie classification, (ii) rankings based on the 2020 QS World University Rankings, and (iii) geographic location. With this augmented dataset, we answered research questions about factors associated with inter-institutional collaborations through statistical analysis. In doing so, we identify the key patterns, trends, and associations from our networked data. Among the results, we found that a research institution's classification is significantly related to its network positions in the collaboration network, specifically its modularity class. Additionally, we found correlations between the institutions' centrality measures in the network, including the degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and structural holes. Finally, our findings indicate an association between the institutions' geographical proximity and their research collaborations. Overall, this study provides a lens through which engineering education researchers, faculty members, and administrators can understand the current state of research collaborations within and across institutions. The results can help researchers answer (and raise more) important research questions, support administrators in making decisions on funding and institutional partnerships, and help faculty members design and develop more effective programs that facilitate research collaborations.",Abdelhamid S.; Jalali Y.; Katz A.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University;Virginia Military Institute,
Student Perceptions of the Complete Online Transition of Two CS Courses in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic,"In this evidence-based practice paper, we present results from surveys of students in two CS courses offered in Spring 2020 at Virginia Tech, a large, public research university: a programming-intensive CS2-level course and an upper division theory course, Formal Languages and Automata. Spring 2020 was extraordinary as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Universities in the US and across the globe switched to a complete online delivery mode instead of the traditional face-to-face mode. This was challenging to both educators and students, as the transition took place on short notice in the middle of the Spring 2020 semester. We were interested to know those course components students perceived as most beneficial to their learning, before and then after the online transition, and their mode preferences for each regarding online vs. Face-to-Face. By comparing student reactions across courses, we gain insights on which components are easily adapted to online delivery, and which require further innovation. COVID was unfortunate, but gave a rare opportunity to compare students' reflections on F2F instruction with online instructional materials for half of a semester vs. entirely online delivery of the same course during the second half. Although the instruction provided during the second half of the semester may not be the same as what would have been provided had the course been designed as a fully online course from the beginning, it did provide the opportunity for us to acquire insights for future instruction. Results indicated that some course components were perceived to be more useful either before or after the transition, and preferences were not the same for the two courses. Furthermore, to determine what course components need further improvement before transitioning to fully online mode, we computed a logistic regression model. Results indicated that for each course, different course components both before and after the transition significantly affected students' preference of course modality.",Farghally M.; Mohammed M.; Mahmoud H.; O'Neil Ellis M.; Haqq D.; Domino M.; Jones B.; Shaffer C.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University;Assiut University,
Adapting an NSF-Funded Professional Skills Curriculum to Train Engineers in Industry: A Case Study,"This design-focused practice paper presents a case study describing how a training program developed for academic contexts was adapted for use with engineers working in industry. The underlying curriculum is from the NSF-funded CyberAmbassadors program, which developed training in communication, teamwork and leadership skills for participants from academic and research settings. For the case study described here, one module from the CyberAmbassadors project was adapted for engineers working in private industry: “Teaming Up: Effective Group and Meeting Management.” The key objectives were to increase knowledge and practical skills within the company's engineering organization, focusing specifically on time management as it relates to project and product delivery. We were also interested in examining the results of translating curricula designed for an academic setting into a corporate setting. Training participants were all from the dedicated engineering department of a US-based location of an international company that provides financial services. The original curriculum was designed for live, in-person training, but was adapted for virtual delivery after the company adopted a 100% remote workforce in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The training was conducted in four phases: (1) train-the-trainer to create internal evangelists; (2) train management to build buy-in and provide sponsorship; (3) phased rollout of training to individual members of the engineering department, contemporaneous with (4) specific and intentional opportunities to apply the skills in normal business activities including Joint Architecture Design (JAD) sessions. Effectiveness was measured through surveys at the engineering management level (before, during, and after training), and through direct discussions with engineering teams who were tracked for four weeks after the training. A number of cultural shifts within the company were observed as direct and indirect outcomes of this training. These include the creation and standardization of a template for meeting agendas; a “grassroots” effort to spread the knowledge and best practices from trained individuals to untrained individuals through informal, peer-to-peer interactions; individuals at varying levels of company hierarchy publicly expressing that they would not attend meetings unless an appropriate agenda was provided in advance; and requests for additional training by management who wanted to increase performance in their employees. As a result of this adaptation from academic to industry training contexts, several key curricular innovations were added back to the original CyberAmbassadors corpus. Examples include a reinterpretation of the separate-but-equal leadership roles within meetings, and the elevation of timekeeper to a controlling leadership role within a meeting. This case study offers valuable lessons on translating training from academic/research settings to industry, including a description of how the “business case” was developed in order to gain approval for the training and sponsorship from management. Future work includes adapting additional material from the CyberAmbassadors program for applications in a business context, and the continued formal and informal propagation of the current material within the company.",Luchini M.; Cribbs D.; Colbry D.; Luchini-Colbry K.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,Michigan State University;HA JACKSON,
Evaluating the Effectiveness of an Undergraduate Engineering Leadership Development Minor on Graduates,"Leadership development programs aim to meet the professional development needs of our graduates while aligning program curriculum to the needs of our graduates' employers. This research paper reports assessment results from a survey of alumni from an undergraduate engineering leadership development (ELD) program as well as undergraduate engineering students not in the leadership program that served as comparisons. The overarching goal of the study was to assess the degree to which the program is meeting its leadership development goals, which include ensuring that the program targets the skills needed in today's workplace. Graduates of the ELDM program (n=147) and graduates not in the program (n = 133) were surveyed and compared to better understand the impact of the ELDM program on the development of skills needed for today's engineering work. Alumni from both groups were asked to rate their agreement with how well their undergraduate experience (and ELD minor specifically) prepared them for their professional career with respect to a number of leadership competencies: 1) leading teams (lead meetings, identify personality preferences and adjust environment/style) 2) think strategically by applying mission, vision, and values statements to a team or organization 3) work effectively in teams 4) apply project management processes to projects 5) give and receive feedback 6) self-reflection on leadership skills and how to improve 7) recognize ethical issues & practice ethical decision making 8) develop a culture that promotes creativity and innovation 9) cross cultural/global competencies (appreciation of other cultures, understanding bias, working in a culturally diverse team) 10) emotional intelligence (regulate emotions and manage conflict) 11) communicate effectively (oral and written, adapt to audience) 12) understand basic business concepts (finance, accounting, marketing, supply chain/operations) 13) confidence in taking initiative with new responsibilities within the organization. Ratings were made using a Likert scale: Extremely well, Fairly well, Moderate, Poorly, Not at all) for each skill separately. Both groups also rated the importance of each skill to their professional work. Differences in alumni's' evaluation of their undergraduate program's preparation for their professional career and importance of leadership skills were evaluated between engineering leadership development minor (ELDM) alumni compared to non-ELDM College of Engineering (CoE) alumni (CoE Comparison Group). Out of the 13 competencies listed above compared across the ELDM and the CoE Comparison groups, ELD minor participants consistently rated the ELD minor significantly higher than the CoE Comparison group ratings of their undergraduate program at preparing/enhancing their ability for their professional career regarding all the leadership competencies/learning outcomes.",Stevens J.; Lang D.; Handley M.; Park J.; Mittan P.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,Pennsylvania State University;Penn State Engineering Leadership Development,
Integration of COMSOL Multiphysics into an Undergraduate Electrical Engineering Curriculum,"There is a need for multiphysics simulation in undergraduate electrical engineering curricula, however, many programs do not include this at the undergraduate level. This paper discusses the integration of multiphysics simulation into an undergraduate curriculum at the University of Pittsburgh for the purposes of educational enhancement and undergraduate research. In this paper, we will discuss an internal grant award that was used to fund 60 student licenses of COMSOL Multiphysics to enhance the electrical engineering curriculum in the aforementioned manner. This is done over the course of three major objectives. First, several modules that were developed over the summer of 2020 as part of a student special project. An undergraduate ECE student at the University of Pittsburgh developed a series of interactive modules which will have a video component to instruct junior electrical engineering students on how to use COMSOL Multiphysics as part of their required electromagnetics course. In these modules, students will learn about device geometry, material properties, simulations meshes, and simulation methods. Students will learn how to model energy storage devices such as parallel plate capacitors and energy transmission devices such as cylindrical conductors. The second major objective is undergraduate research. In this paper, an undergraduate research project which took place over the summer of 2020 at the University of Pittsburgh as part of the Mascaro Center for Sustainable Innovation's undergraduate research program, will be discussed. In this project, undergraduate student researcher modeled an aluminum conductor, steel reinforced, transmission line conductor to verify its resistance, inductance, and capacitance. This model will be the basis for artificial intelligence application training of transmission line measurements. The third major objective is to integrate this multiphysics tool into a junior level semiconductor device theory course and a senior level applications of fields and waves course. These courses have traditionally given students' difficulties due to the abstract and “hard to visualize” nature of the course. The implementation of COMSOL into these courses is discussed.",Kerestes R.; Popovski A.; Xiong F.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,University of Pittsburgh,
Community-engaged Learning in Construction Education: A Case Study,"Community-Engaged Learning (CEL) integrates academic education with the application of institutional resources to manage challenges facing communities through engagement so that societal needs identified by a community will be addressed. CEL provides opportunities to critically examine social issues and situate students within a community setting. CEL also enhances the engagement with a community to address and embodies ethical and effective service principles, which result in producing reciprocal benefits for students, faculty, and community partners. Thus, CEL is commonly connected to innovation, learning, and partnership and all these together make a better life. Through mutually beneficial partnerships within the community, students cultivate their identity as lifelong learners and active citizens. CEL promotes a culture of active and engaged learners by integrating opportunities for students to apply construction theories and knowledge through real-world experiences. Although CEL classes can be taught in all disciplines, the learning approach fits well with the characteristics of the construction area and learning objectives that educators in this field pursue. Construction educators and administrators envision that CEL projects give students the opportunity to conduct market research and contribute to public and private buildings. CEL coursework underscores the critical connection between learning and doing, giving our students the knowledge and experience to be lifelong citizens, whether in their hometown or across the world. This paper briefly describes the process of CEL in the construction program at Mississippi State University. A qualitative method was utilized to ensure an in-depth exploration of the triangular learning space, consisting of students, community partners, and educators. The results indicate the effectiveness of the CEL paradigm in construction education.",Rokooei S.; Garraway M.; Karji A.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,Mississippi State University;Pennsylvania State University,Community engaged learning ;  Construction education ;  CoOp program
Visions of Engineers for the Future: A Comparison of American and Chinese Policy Discourses on Engineering Education Innovation,"The US National Academy of Engineering reports The Engineer of 2020 and Educating the Engineer of 2020 marked an important shift in policy thinking regarding engineering education: the emphasis of engineering education leaders thence shifted from producing engineers based on existing socioeconomic demands to actively envisioning and shaping the roles and characteristics of engineers in the future. Writing in the year of 2020, when engineering education yet again faces looming paradigm shift driven in part by a global pandemic and major powers' adjustment in attitudes and strategies to globalization, we attempt to reassess visions of “engineers for the future,” as reflected through policy discourses in the United States and China, two major players in global engineering education. For this purpose, we present a careful reading of recent policy documents published by the US National Academy of Engineering (NAE) and the Chinese Ministry of Education (MoE). The NAE (2018) report Understanding the Educational and Career Pathways of Engineers resulted from a study commissioned by the Academy to “understand characteristics and career choices of engineering graduates, … as well as the characteristics of those with non-engineering degrees who are employed as engineers in the United States.” Authors of the report sought to sustain the supply of competent engineers in the US by investigating “the engineering education-to-workforce pathway.” Around the same time that the NAE study was conducted, engineering educators and policy makers in China were engaged in a series of conversations aimed at renewing China's engineering education for the next thirty years. These conversations laid the groundwork for the Emerging Engineering Education (3E) initiative, announced officially by the MoE in 2017 and followed by waves of funded engineering education research and practice projects across the nation. This paper examines and compares the visions of “engineers for the future” embodied in the NAE (2018) report and the 3E initiative (2017) in China. Our analysis of policy texts seeks to answer the following questions: What assessment of engineering education reality in the US and in China respectively motivated the NAE study and the 3E initiative? What visions of engineers and engineering education are advanced in the respective policy documents? Accordingly, what changes in engineering education are recommended for meeting the visions proposed by policy scholars in the US and China? Answering these questions will help us engage critically in discourses about the future of engineers and engineering education from a transnational perspective. Perhaps through conversations involving the global community of engineering educators, we might aspire to a broader and more inclusive vision of global engineering education than NAE and MoE has each aspired to accomplish in its own national context.",Cao Y.; Ma X.; Case J.; Jesiek B.; Knight D.; Oakes W.; Paretti M.; Tang X.; Xie Z.; Zhao H.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University;Tsinghua University;Purdue University,
Research on Cultural Origins and Influence on Engineering Entrepreneurial Education within Colleges and Universities in Chinese Mainland,"The entrepreneurship education in engineering education is a long-term, complex and arduous system engineering. It requires the cooperation and joint efforts of the country, universities, students, society and related industries. Over the past several years, Chinese mainland has implemented the policy of “mass entrepreneurship and innovation” and promoted “innovative and entrepreneurial education”. How to achieve effective integration of engineering education and entrepreneurship education is a top priority for higher education in Chinese mainland. Horizontally, the entrepreneurship education of Chinese mainland is an important tributary of the international entrepreneurship education. Vertically, colleges and universities should also need to excavate the essence of Chinese culture and exerting its leading value, which helps to form specific entrepreneurship education model. Thus, entrepreneurial culture in higher engineering education needs to be examined from historical and cultural perspective. This research first analyzes the origins of entrepreneurial culture in higher engineering education; secondly, explores the influences of entrepreneurial culture in higher engineering education; finally, analyzes the implications of entrepreneurial culture in higher engineering education based on a cultural perspective, especially in the cultural ecology of Chinese mainland. This research preliminarily shows that the practice of engineering entrepreneurship education within colleges and universities in Chinese mainland urgently seeks rational reflection on the inheritance of traditional culture, the values excavation of traditional business culture, the value recognition of entrepreneurship education, and functions exertion of modern university culture, in order to enhance the level of entrepreneurship education in higher engineering education.",Li M.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,Beijing Foreign Studies University,Chinese mainland ;  Colleges and universities ;  Engineering education ;  Entrepreneurial culture ;  Entrepreneurship education
"Embracing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Our Classroom and Teaching","Recent events have brought to light the gravity of the challenges that our society faces today relative to systemic racism and its impact on equity and access in our society. Marginalized groups face daily microaggressions and bias due to the impacts of systemic racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, and other forms of oppression. Recently, the NAE hosted their annual meeting and included a keynote speaker, Dr. John Slaughter, who has committed his life's work to dismantling racism specifically in engineering education. He called the organization and members to recognize the challenges that systemic racism poses for the engineering field and to take action in changing the way our students are educated. Dr. Slaughter pointed out that without an inclusive engineering workforce, we are missing viable and important solutions to engineering problems. As engineering leadership educators, our obligation to our students extends beyond transmission of technical knowledge. We have a responsibility to infuse our curriculum with knowledge of systemic racism, how bias can impact our solutions, and how engineers can lead and create teams that foster belonging and inclusivity. We must help engineering leadership students develop a growth mindset and discover the sophistication of mind to celebrate diversity, equity, and inclusion in their daily lives, school, and workplace. This requires us to consider inclusive leadership as a foundational approach to engineering leadership development. Inclusive leadership has been shown to positively impact team performance, decision-making, collaboration, innovation, and motivation. Inclusive leaders celebrate differences and recognize and challenge attacks on DEI. As engineering leadership educators, we must lead by example, model inclusive leadership behavior, and have courage to infuse these concepts into our curriculum. This paper assembles the collective thoughts, perspectives, insights, and experiences of a distinguished panel of educators and scholars on embracing diversity, equity, and inclusion in the classroom and teaching practices. The panel brings together people from multiple universities, different stages of their career, with interests in various areas related to DEI. It includes John Slaughter who has devoted his life to combatting racism, to scholars whose research is dedicated to teaching about DEI and creating a work environment that values DEI, and educators who have found creative ways to incorporate DEI in their instruction of engineering courses. The panel and this paper will have recommendations on why it is important to welcome DEI in our workplace and in our classrooms, how to embrace DEI in designing and delivering our courses and teaching strategies to celebrate and support DEI as we prepare students for the workforce.",Asgarpoor J.; Handley M.; Sarang-Sieminski A.; Slaughter J.; Pollock M.; Murzi H.; Cox M.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,Franklin W.

A Take on the Process of Proposal Development and the Scaling of Teams Towards Development of Competitive Proposals: A”Group Genius” Approach,"This contribution provides a schema that has been leveraged by a group of interdisciplinary scholars who form the Renaissance Foundry Research Group (RFRG) to develop novel, interdisciplinary, and collaboration-centered approaches to the grant writing process as applied to engineering education. This schema, which leverages the Renaissance Foundry Model (herein the Foundry) [1], provides a process suitable for the integration of interdisciplinary voices, fosters equitable conversations, and develops logistic models vital to the processes by which funding opportunities are generated and explored within a “group genius” approach inspired by Dr. Keith Sawyer's work regarding the role of collaboration on the creative process and ensuing innovations [2]. As part of this contribution, examples of successful grant writing ventures and the subsequent implementation of these ventures to advance engineering education are featured and further explored through the schema. This approach is expected to be of value to new and experienced faculty and administrative personnel interested in developing the communication skills and collaborations critically important for forming effective, equitable team-based funding structures.",Arce P.; Arce-Trigatti A.; Jorgensen S.; Sanders R.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,Tennessee Technological University,
Institutional Supports for Student Experiential Learning in Hybrid/Remote Learning Contexts,"Students' experiential learning in out-of-class involvements encompasses a significant part of their engagement and professional development in college. The covid-19 pandemic has challenged the delivery of these experiential learning opportunities, requiring student affairs professionals to significantly adapt their programming to continue serving students in ways that accommodate social distancing guidelines, in-person event capacity limits, and remote participants. While research has investigated online learning in classroom contexts, less is known about the implications of a virtual learning environment on engagement in experiential learning. This study addresses the following research question: How are student affairs professionals adapting their programs and services to support student engagement in response to the covid pandemic? This study captures how student affairs professionals at a large Midwestern research university have adjusted programming and engagement efforts to maintain key elements of experiential learning in hybrid and remote learning contexts, where students' engagement ranges from entirely on-line to various combinations of partial in-person and online participation. The Midwestern university transitioned from predominantly residential to fully online during the spring 2020 semester and then allowed students to choose whether to continue fully online or return to campus for a hybrid learning environment in the fall 2020 semester. This study draws on Schlossberg's transition theory to examine how student affairs professionals transitioned programs and services in the 2020-2021 academic year to respond to the covid-19 pandemic and the associated changing safety guidelines. Facing unique challenges in this varied, constantly changing environment, student affairs professionals described three key elements of successful program and service adaptations: (1) a focus on student needs, (2) collaboration across student support units, and (3) creativity and innovation in approaches to engage students. Through thematic analysis of interviews with 13 student affairs professionals (including student organization advisors and administrators, student programming coordinators, and student support specialists), research findings provide further insight into the challenges and opportunities presented in adapting experiential learning to hybrid and remote formats. Research findings will help inform ongoing efforts to craft hybrid and remote student programming and services that support and engage students in these unprecedented times. These findings can also inform the development of student support programs for the growing body of online students in higher education.",Johnson B.; Whitehead A.; Main J.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,Purdue University,
Women and BIPOC in Aerospace: Where did they come from and how did they get here?,"The low number of women and black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) compared to their population, is well-documented in engineering, engineering technology, and other STEM fields. Through this and ancillary documentation there is agreement that increasing the numbers of women and other minorities in these areas will enhance productivity and the breadth of new innovation. Many efforts have been made to increase the number of women and BIPOC in STEM fields. The result of those efforts has been disappointing as they have resulted in minimal growth in engineering and virtual stagnation in other areas of STEM. The aviation and aerospace industries are facing significant difficulties in filling technical positions for people with STEM credentials. One may argue that current conditions create a slowdown in the demand for people in these positions; however, the current slowdown in aerospace provides time to further develop the pipeline to be ready for the expected resurgence of need in this area. To meet this demand, targeted efforts need to be designed and implemented to attract, educate, employ, and retain these highly skilled women and the BIPOC demographic. Since these groups are historically underrepresented in STEM, an added opportunity to bridge the population gap in fields such as those identified in the aerospace industry. This study aims to review the existing research on why women and BIPOC enter technical fields, the challenges they find, what makes them stay or leave, and what are some of the alternative pathways to increase the population of women and BIPOC in the aerospace industry.",Yother T.; Lucietto A.; Umberger G.; Johnson M.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,Purdue University,Aerospace ;  Aviation ;  BIPOC ;  Black ;  Diversity ;  Female ;  Indigenous ;  Persistence ;  Retention ;  Women ;  Workforce
Video Mediated Communication (VMC) Fluency for Today's Engineering Student: You're on Camera,"This paper reports preliminary results showing improvements in engineering students' fluency in Video-Mediated Communication (VMC). VMC has been studied for over twenty-five years, and current industry practices are biasing toward a remote, connected, and agile workforce. The 2010 NSF Workshops on Communicating Science: Tools for Scientists and Engineers reports that traditional education and training typically do not prepare scientists and engineers to communicate effectively with industry, policymakers, and public stakeholders. Engineers are increasingly expected to communicate their results directly to the greater public. Engineers' clear communication with these audiences ensures continuity in critical operations during times of crisis. Today's engineering graduate must master effective communication skills to foster productive team dynamics, propose persuasive projects, provide valuable status updates to management, and affect change within his or her organization-all while video conferencing. VMC, an alternative to face-to-face communication that occurs over an information technology platform, is positioned to occupy a more central role in engineering curricula. Preliminary analysis of student performance traits over three semesters indicates that students can measurably improve their presentation skills and interactions with supervisors. Situated in a senior engineering design capstone course, results show that students' VMC fluency improved. When subjected to rubric-based intervention strategies and repeated exposure, engineering students gained enhanced audience awareness and practical knowledge. This study contributes to understanding how communication development emerges and is best fostered in engineering students. Key research impacts include a feature-based model of successful VMC interactions and recommended rubric-based best practices for curricular inclusion of VMC. As engineering students' academic and professional lives unfold increasingly online due to the globalization of labor, engineers will need to become fluent in using VMC to manage professional perceptions and mission. Given the growing national demand for engineers' innovations, the timing is ideal to study engineers' communicative capacity and the conditions and interventions that offer them the greatest support for communicative success.",Eggleston A.; Rabb R.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,The Citadel - The Military College of South Carolina,
Work in Progress: Post-Pandemic Opportunities to Re-Engineer Engineering Education: A Pragmatic-Futurist Framework,"In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, education has stepped up some of its long-overdue transformations. Higher education (HE) and Engineering Education (E.E.), particularly, is facing a potential crisis. Engineering schools and professional societies are dealing with several pressing problems that potentially threaten their survival. Although E.E. leaders are bound to focus on short-term survival, sustainable growth and development in the long term must also feature in the agenda. In this work, the context of disruption in the education domain is revisited through a literature review, related threats and opportunities are identified, and a strategic way forward is investigated in those lights from Engineering Education's perspective to inform a pragmatic futurist's perspective. A needs-driven innovation model (why-what-how approach) is pursued to present the study where the shift in mindset, changes in infrastructure, and leveraging digital technologies emerged as the central concepts. Each of those broad implementation categories encompassed various subsequent initiatives such as a life-long learner's mindset, a focus on how-to-learn, a strong emphasis on professional skill development, industry-academia alliances, a reflective broadening of engineers' considerations, and extensive opportunities for multi-disciplinary collaboration. To this end, we propose a pragmatic futuristic framework for accessible access to affordable, relevant, and personalized education for learners, faculty, and institutions from all diverse backgrounds. The new framework encourages fresh relationships among the key actors in the context of new modalities for the transfer and co-creation of knowledge, requirements, and possibilities for change in operational models and tapping into the boundary-breaking opportunities fostered by digital ways of teaching and learning. This study aims to provide a future-proof pathway for the engineering education ecosystem to better equip it for solving real-world problems with a multi-disciplinary approach to create new value for society. In the process, the study also sheds light on relevant new research avenues.",Maharubin S.; Arefeen S.; Campbell R.; Taraban R.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,Texas Tech University,
Research on the Diffusion of Innovation within Higher Education: Case of Double First-rate Initiative in the Chinese Mainland,"World-class university construction is a systematic and complex project led by the government with the purpose of constructing world-class universities or disciplines, and has far-reaching national strategic implications. In recent years, the academia has tried to analyse China's world-class university construction based on Support Alliance Theory, Multiple Streams Framework, Policy Tool Theory, and Process Reen-gineering Theory. Although domestic scholar has tried to use the Diffusion of Innovation Theory to study higher education policies in provincial administrative regions, the perspective only focuses on the mechanisms. As a significant innovation within higher education, the diffusion of Double First-rate Initiative in the Chinese Mainland refers to whether the policy can be promoted rationally and successfully. Based on the Diffusion of Innovation Theory, this research takes Double First-rate Initiative as a case, constructs a prelimenary analysis framework for the diffusion of Double First-rate Initiative, and furtherly explores the fundamental pathways, affacting factors and important mechanisms. Findings reveal that the diffusion of Double First-rate Initiative can be explained by the Diffusion of Innovation Theory; shows uniqueness in the time, spatial and organisational dimensions; implies horizontal, vertical and multidirectional diffusion mechanisms; is affected by factors such as motivation, resource, external environment and policy attribute.",Li M.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,Beijing Foreign Studies University,Diffusion of Innovation Theory ;  Double First-rate Initiative ;  Mechanism ;  Public policy ;  World-class university
"A Quarter Century of Minorities in Engineering: Design, Development and Team Teaching of Institutional Core Curricula","We have been teaching Institutional core curricula courses at The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) since 1996. The course curricula, sources, and most relevant, the innovations in teaching each course have impacted STEM student success and learning. The Texas Core Curriculum (TCC) is defined by the Texas Education Code (TEC) Section 61.821 as:... ""the curriculum in liberal arts, humanities, and sciences and political, social, and cultural history that all undergraduate students of an institution of higher education are required to complete before receiving an academic undergraduate degree."" Texas Senate Bill (SB) 148, passed by the 75th Texas Legislature in January 1997, repealed previous legislation concerning either lower-division transfer or core curriculum and sought to resolve concerns regarding the transfer of lower-division course credit among Texas public colleges and universities while maintaining the core curriculum as one of the fundamental components of a high-quality undergraduate educational experience. More recent sessions of the Texas Legislature have fine-tuned the existing laws regarding the core curriculum, but the essentials of the statutes have not changed since 1997. UTEP selected the specific courses that it offers to fulfill that framework of the UCC, taking into account the individual role and mission of our Minority Serving institution. The UCC implementation at our institution requires we gain approval from the certifying body for the university's state. All institutions in the state must evaluate the effectiveness of their UCC at regular intervals. Our teaching methods and content has evolved such that the institution's component courses and pedagogies of Team Teaching are vital to achieving the desired outcomes. Our model is an ""all in"" team endeavor; our instructional team meets with all classes, and such is an enterprising dynamic, engaging faculty, staff, and near-peer teachers, working together. Modeling teamwork is a core attribution of our approach. Research-to-practice becomes practice-to-research as we learn new ways to help our students succeed while growing their preparedness for future success in their degree aspirations. Our sharing focuses on entering students and Juniors. All students in the university take these courses: STEM students learn discourse and liberal arts critical thinking, and non-STEM students learn the value of sciences, (big) data, and scientific analyses. One of the most important provisions of the UCC is that it allows students who successfully complete core curriculum courses at one institution to transfer (up to) the entire set of completed courses to another public institution of higher education without the need to repeat any core courses. Students who transfer without completing the whole (42-SCH) core curriculum also receive credit for each of the core courses they satisfy. Although the studies included in the CUC may vary by institution, every higher education institution's core curriculum in our state must consist of 6-SCH of Foundational Component Areas. These courses are the focus of our sharing. A final segment of our work is designing the latest core course, which includes an emphasis on innovation and leadership engineering. Thus, the newest part of our work is developing the latest core course, emphasizing innovation and leadership engineering. The course arises as a natural outgrowth of our work and the changes in society and STEM education necessary to promote lifelong learning.",Golding P.; Golding D.; Navar C.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,The University of Texas at El Paso,
Integrating Laser-scanning Technology into a Construction Engineering and Management Curriculum,"Laser scanning technology has emerged as an essential tool in measuring and documenting existing conditions of buildings and infrastructures. It has been widely used in surveying, recording existing structures, calculating quantity, monitoring construction progress, understanding the general topography of a site, capturing the complicated geometries seen in manufacturing facilities, and supporting Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Virtual Design and Construction (VDC). While it has become popular for construction engineering and management programs to include Building Information Modeling in their curricula, very few construction programs have introduced laser scanning technology to their students. The high cost of the laser scanner and the associated software, the lack of qualified instructors, and the lack of an accreditation requirement are the primary reasons for this situation. However, recently, the construction industry has adopted many technological innovations, and the cost of laser scanners has been going down. Educators need to look into the potential of adopting laser scanning in their curricula. This research aims to assess the need for and evaluate the feasibility of incorporating laser scanning technology into the construction engineering and management curriculum. The study conducted a thorough literature review to assess how laser scanning technology can improve Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs), which are required by the American Council of Construction Education (ACCE). The contributions of the study involve (1) helping educators in construction engineering and management programs to understand the importance of laser scanning technology in the construction industry, (2) improving current Student Learning Outcomes by using laser scanning technology.",Zhang C.; Arditi D.; Liu P.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,University of Wyoming;Illinois Institute of Technology,Construction engineering and management ;  Curriculum development ;  Laser scanning technology ;  Student learning outcomes
”Blessing in Disguise”: Understanding the Racialized and Gendered Experience of a Black Woman's Pathway in Engineering,"This research paper examines the experiences of a Black woman, Simone, pursuing engineering through an interdisciplinary engineering program. As the nature of engineering work explicitly calls for novel practices and innovations to solve complex challenges, the demand for interdisciplinary engineering programs has increased. While these programs are far and few between, there's potential to broaden the ways in which engineers solve problems and broaden who can see themselves as an engineer. This study examines her experiences to understand how she defined her identity and established a sense of belonging as a Black woman in engineering by navigating through multiple disciplines within and outside the engineering college. Simone's account illustrates how some students may feel invisible in traditional engineering spaces and attribute a sense of belonging to being trusted as a knowledgeable person. Although Simone acknowledged how she did not feel invisible in the interdisciplinary engineering program, she actively chose to remain at the peripheral of the program. This work highlights the need to improve disciplinary cultures where certain students cannot fall under the radar due to the biases of faculty and students to recognize the value of their knowledge and p erspectives in engineering classrooms.",Benedict B.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,Purdue University,
Work-in-Progress: The Design and Implementation of EFRI-Research Experience in Mentoring Catalyst Initiative,"The National Science Foundation (NSF) Emerging Frontiers and Innovation (EFRI) Research Experience and Mentoring (REM) program nationally supports hands-on research and ongoing mentorship in STEM fields at various universities and colleges. The NSF EFRI-REM Mentoring Catalyst initiative was designed to build and train these robust, interactive research mentoring communities that are composed of faculty, postdoctoral associates and graduate student mentors, to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in STEM research who are funded through NSF EFRI-REM. This work-in-progress paper describes the first five years of this initiative, where interactive training programs were implemented from multiple frameworks of effective mentoring. Principal investigators, postdoctoral associates and graduate students are often expected to develop and establish mentoring plans without any formal training in how to be effective mentors. Since the start of this initiative, over 300 faculty, postdoctoral associates and graduate students have been trained on promising practices, strategies, and tools to enhance their research mentoring experiences. In addition to formal mentor training, opportunities to foster a community of practice with current mentors and past mentor training participants (sage mentors) were provided. During these interactions, promising mentoring practices were shared to benefit the mentors and the different mentoring populations that the EFRI-REMs serve. The community of practice connected a diverse group of institutions and faculty to help the EFRI-REM community in its goal of broadening participation across a range of STEM disciplines. Those institutions are then able to discuss, distill and disseminate best practices around the mentoring of participants through targeted mentored training beyond the EFRI-REM at their home institutions. Not only does the EFRI-REM Catalyst initiative focus on broadening participation via strategic training of research mentors, it also empowers mentees, including undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral associates, in their research experiences through an entering research undergraduate course and formal mentoring training workshops. Future expansion to other academic units (e.g., colleges, universities) builds on the research collaborations and the initiatives developed and presented in this work-in-progress paper. A long-term goal is to provide insights via collaborative meetings (e.g., webinars, presentations) for STEM and related faculty who are assembling an infrastructure (e.g., proposals for the ERFI-REM program) across a range of research structures.

CAREER: Learning from Students' Identity Trajectories to Actualize Latent Diversity,"This executive summary describes the progression of a research project focused on characterizing latent diversity (i.e., not readily visible attitudes, beliefs, and mindsets that are assets that students bring to engineering) through student narratives of their identity trajectories. Despite significant and large-scale initiatives, the field of engineering struggles with recruiting and retaining diverse talent, addressing diversity, equity, and inclusion, and promoting innovation in problem-solving approaches and engineering solutions. We hypothesize that engineering education's socialization process leads to the homogenization of students' ways of being, thinking, and knowing (i.e., a norming process to specific cultural norms). This process often alienates students who do not align with engineering's cultural norms and practices, which are shaped by Whiteness and masculinity. As a result, seemingly identical portrayals of what engineering is and who becomes an engineer have permeated engineering students' and professionals' stories for decades. This research provides a broader understanding of engineering inclusion by unpacking actionable ways to actualize latent diversity in engineering, leading to a demonstrable change in engineering climate and culture.",Godwin A.; Benedict B.; Rohde J.; Clements H.; Perkins H.; Melo J.; Castillo A.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,"Purdue University;University of California, Irvine",
The Urgency of Intersectionality: A Review of Racialized Experiences in STEM Entrepreneurship,"In the 1980s, businesses in the United States (U.S.) experienced an increased interest in entrepreneurship which created a significant growth in innovation through entrepreneurship education and programming. This growth influenced the creation of new federal policies (e.g., the Bayh-Dole Act) and federal government agencies' programming (e.g., SBIR, STTR and I-Corps) that sparked innovation to help drive the U.S. economy forward. Although there has been a significant push for entrepreneurship and innovation, there is still a lack of representation of racially minoritized populations (i.e., African Americans or Black people, Hispanics/Latinx, and Native Americans/Alaskan Natives) in entrepreneurship, innovation, and science technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. In 2012, the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) Office of Advocacy found that racially minoritized business owners accounted for only 22.9% of all U.S. business owners. This representation is even lower within STEM entrepreneurship (i.e., individuals in STEM disciplines who practice entrepreneurship or innovation as business owners or by starting a new venture). Previous research has focused on understanding and improving racial disparities and diversity gaps within STEM and within entrepreneurship that affect women, people of color, and low-income populations. Here, we present a literature review that seeks to describe the current state of knowledge in examining the experiences of racially minoritized populations in STEM entrepreneurship and how they are studied with hopes to identify potential opportunities for research in the future and the use of intersectionality. During the 1990s, the term “intersectionality” emerged from critical legal scholarship to examine how systems of power (e.g., racism, sexism, classism, ableism) intersect to affect the social and political implications of individuals' lived experiences. Since then, intersectionality has become a critical approach to better understand and address the experiences and challenges of racially minoritized populations. The goal of this review is to summarize how the experiences of racially minoritized individuals in STEM entrepreneurship are studied and provide an overview of the frameworks used and study outcomes. First, we conducted a literature review search using Scopus and ProQuest to include literature on underrepresented populations' experiences in STEM entrepreneurship using a combination of the STEM, entrepreneurship, diversity, and experience search strings. Next, we explored the 772 results. We then applied all inclusion and exclusion criteria to this literature review search and removed all duplicates. This resulted in eight remaining articles that studied the experiences of racially minoritized populations in STEM entrepreneurship. However, none of these articles referenced intersectionality or used intersectionality as a framework to examine the experiences of racially minoritized populations. This resulted in many of the research findings' being limited and unable to address the unique barriers that racially minoritized populations confront in STEM entrepreneurship. Thus, we propose the use of Intersectionality Theory as a lens for examining STEM entrepreneurship will help to better understand the complex intersecting identities that shape social inequality and the experiences of marginalized groups in STEM entrepreneurship.",Jackson J.; Huang-Saad A.; Mondisa J.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,"Northeastern University;University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",Entrepreneurship ;  Intersectionality ;  Racially minoritized groups ;  STEM
Cultivating Student Adoption of Design Thinking and Entrepreneurial Skills by Addressing Complex Challenges in Healthcare Through Industry Partnerships,"This paper highlights the establishment of an on-campus center for biomedical engineering design and innovation (BioInnovation and Design Lab) that partners with industry to apply design thinking and entrepreneurial skills to solve 21st-century problems across biomedical fields. The students, faculty, and research staff affiliated with the Lab leverage an authentic design process that sources real-world engineering problems and engages multidisciplinary teams of engineers, scientists, and business professionals in an immersive and iterative prototyping process. To scale and sustain the impact of the Lab, a three-way value proposition was developed that aimed to deliver value to the students, faculty, and external partners. The Lab offers students immersive co-curricular experiences and design projects that enable them to work with real industry customers and expert mentors to gain applied skills that advance their careers in healthcare innovation. It aligns and extends the expertise of faculty through key external partnerships by enabling sponsored industry projects and paving the way for long-term partnerships in select technical areas. The Lab creates value for external partners by undertaking research and design projects that address key business objectives. The activities of the Lab are measured against performance indicators directly related to student training and engagement of faculty and industry mentors and adjusted to improve overall efficiency. In addition, we gathered qualitative data to ascertain the successful delivery of the value propositions. Recent lab alumni and industry partners were surveyed to determine whether they received the value that was promised and expected, as well as to discover why the lab was important to them, and what they valued most. We invited feedback from representatives of the university and school corporate and external relations programs, as well as the members of its advisory board to learn more about the overall value the Lab brings to the university and its stakeholders.",Scott J.; Bouzos E.; Hendricks M.; Asuri P.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,Santa Clara University,
Decades of Alumni: What Can We Learn from Designing a Survey to Examine the Impact of Project-based Courses Across Generations?,"For over half a century, the “Project-Based Engineering Design Innovation & Development” (ME310) course has engaged Stanford University graduate students in industry-sponsored projects focusing on various phases of integrated design thinking through engineering fabrication. In recent decades, in synchrony with the growing demands of today's design engineering professionals, these projects have advanced an innovation focus both in process and outcome. Yet, evidence of how the course experience has contributed to entrepreneurial interests lies primarily in anecdotal examples and stories about the career trajectories of former students and how they have gone on to leverage their prototypes into commercial products. As a result, this research paper examines the impact of intensive course-based design experiences such as ME310 on the entrepreneurial outcomes and innovation behaviors of alumni through the design and implementation of an alumni survey aimed at gathering feedback and input into specific curricular efforts. Administered to over 800 alumni covering a 25 year span from 1992-2018, the ME310 Alumni Survey included demographic questions and items organized around three areas: 1) educational background and career decisions such as first job after completing the course and current or most recent job; 2) attitudes towards memorable and meaningful experiences in the course including key projects, assignments, and skills and abilities acquired; and 3) entrepreneurial outcomes and self-efficacy measures focusing on innovation and design thinking. This focus on the course experience as the unit of analysis resulted in new insights and a deeper understanding of intended and unintended learning outcomes as informed by the responses of former students based on their career choice pathways in a variety of industry sectors and the 'lessons learned' and takeaways from the course and reported over time. This longitudinal approach to course alumni surveys can be adapted for and implemented in other courses and environments for purposes of curriculum refinement and quality improvement in order to accommodate the needs of key stakeholders including the faculty and teaching team, alumni, and current and future students.",Sheppard S.; Chen H.; Toye G.; Kempf F.; Elfiki N.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,Stanford University;King's College London,
Exploring Values and Norms of Engineering Through Responsible Innovation and Critiques of Engineering Cultures,"Engineers are often taught that ethics entail the adherence to a code of conduct, which can guide their professional behavior. Alternatively, engineers may learn that research ethics are represented by the principles of Responsible Conduct of Research. Both of these approaches ask for engineers to learn, accept and conform to values that are instantiated by external organizations. This is intended to support an individual's decision-making in the face of discrete moral or ethical quandaries. Prior scholarship by Donna Riley, Erin Cech and Amy Slaton offer critiques of engineering culture that point to the myth of objectivity, reductionism, and grit, while underscoring an uncritical acceptance of authority. Cech's work on the “culture of disengagement” and the pillars of depoliticization, socio-technical dualism and meritocracy demonstrated shifts in values among students at four very different universities in Massachusetts. Out of political science and technology assessment the concept of responsible innovation is gaining traction as a means to bring values and norms into the center of innovation activities, exemplified in works by Rene von Schomberg and David Guston. However, the critiques of engineering cultures are often absent from concepts of responsible innovation. For if responsible innovation is a normative shift towards a better future, then understanding what is undesirable about the cultures of engineering and innovation must be equally important. This research explores how engineering students at a university in Virginia express values and norms when asked the question: “What is engineering?” The research design captured long-form essays prior to and after taking an engineering ethics course. Those essays were coded thematically for dimensions of irresponsible innovation, e.g., myth of objectivity, depoliticization and reductionism, as well as for dimensions of responsible innovation including stakeholder engagement, future anticipation of consequences, and adaptiveness. Methodologically, the results suggest that long-form essays, in addition to the surveys used by Cech and the case studies offered by Riley, offer an intriguing method to analyze the emergent values and norms among engineering students. Secondarily, the empirical results suggest subtle shifts in the discourse about what engineering is and, thus recognition of values that might underpin cultures of responsible innovation.",Foley R.; Sinclair R.; Dennis A.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,University of Virginia;Purdue University,Content analysis ;  Engineering education ;  Engineering ethics
Creative Self-Efficacy of Undergraduate Women Engineering Majors,"Creative self-efficacy (CSE) was studied in connection to beliefs about creativity. CSE is one's belief in their own creative potential. The belief that creativity can improve was discussed as a “Growth Creativity Mindset” (GCM), and the belief that creativity cannot improve was discussed as a “Fixed Creativity Mindset” (FCM). Creativity within engineering has been described as crucial to the field, and as an aspect that is appealing to women engineers. Undergraduate women engineering students local to the Philadelphia area volunteered to take a survey of CSE and beliefs about creativity. Quantitative data analysis showed that an increase in GCM likely results in an increase in CSE for students with higher than average GPA. A change in CSE had no effect on FCM. Interviews were conducted with 15 survey respondents with different levels of CSE who met criteria for success in the engineering major (2.5 GPA or above and successful completion of calculus II). Synthesis of the quantitative and qualitative data revealed that interview participants had similar lived experiences that lead them to a level of success in the engineering major, but different lived experiences that distinguished them with respect to CSE level. All participants were exposed to project based learning (PBL), had strong personal influences, exhibited perseverance in overcoming struggles, and described their negative perceptions of engineering before entering the major. Participants with all levels of CSE highlighted their own creativity with respect to the performing and visual arts, before reflecting on innovation as creative. Most participants with low CSE described their lack of creativity in the arts. They also discussed being “intimidated” by negative classroom experiences more than their peers with higher levels of CSE. Those with low CSE were also exposed to more engineering centered experiences in high school, and most had a parent who worked in the profession. It is expected that this research will provide a more comprehensive understanding of CSE, perceptions of engineering as a creative field, and the educational reform needed that connects creativity to engineering in an atmosphere that welcomes diversity.",Delahanty C.; Silverman J.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,Drexel University;Bucks County Community College,
Design Systems Thinking for Innovation in an Engineering Faculty Development Program,"This is a work in progress paper describes design systems thinking as a paradigm for evolving faculty development. Managing organizational change is a difficult task, often dependent on the way ideas are operationalized for effective innovation. Systems thinking leverages value creation across organizational systems to support innovation based on design. This paper explores the utility of design systems thinking for creating innovation in a national engineering faculty development program. Design systems thinking has been used by Engineering Unleashed as part of a multi-year innovation effort in engineering faculty development. We seek to shift the mindset of traditional engineering faculty development using best practices for relationship building by coaching, mentoring, and through communities of practice. Two outcomes of the systems thinking model from this work include (i) a faculty fellowship program to recognize and reward faculty development of transformational projects and (ii) self-paced learning structures to encourage emergent ideas. This paper addresses the first steps for the following research questions: • Does a design systems thinking approach create a responsive model for a community-driven faculty development program? Does this model adapt to community needs and individual faculty career needs? • Will a design systems thinking approach support the community development of a sustainable model for faculty development that thrives outside of the funding organization? This project is ongoing and this paper reports on the way design systems thinking has been used to create a bottom-up and top-down innovation structure. Preliminary results in this paper include an analysis of growth in the faculty development program, a timeline of expected evolution, and a summary of community engagement structures in place. The poster presentation will focus on the evolution of the faculty development program.",Melton D.; Dillon H.; Nagurka M.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,"Marquette University;University of Washington, Tacoma;Kern Entrepreneurial Engineering Network",
Culturally Responsive Engineering Education: Creativity Through”Empowered to Change” in the U.S. and ”Admonished to Preserve” in Japan,"Enhancing creativity is an indispensable goal of many engineering courses. However, with flourishment of global collaboration in various engineering classrooms and best educational practices being replicated across cultures, there are not many curriculum interventions that originate from students' diverse cultural needs. When cultural differences are ignored, students may get culturally biased grades and face confusion and difficulties. For instance, the notion of “disruption” and “breakthrough” in product design innovation is culturally and locally shaped in the U.S. and might be considered undesirable in Japan. For example, Japanese students coming to a U.S. university for a co-final presentation with their U.S. student partners may get ill-evaluated due to lack of articulation on how their ideas break through the status quo. This is problematic given that student evaluation is less based on traditional exams of fundamental science knowledge, but rather increasingly subject to culturally-shaped experience. The paper is centered around the idea that engineers are motivated by the cultural values with which they identify. In the U.S., the motivation to promote change is widely held to underpin the generation of new ideas and value creation. In contrast, preservation is perceived as demanding but taken very seriously in Japan and change from this perspective can be seen as an unconstrained, irresponsible mission that requires less effort. The paper empirically examines the cultural dimensions of creativity in engineering education, specifically how engineering students' motivations for creative problem-solving are different in the U.S. than in Japan. A cross-cultural survey study was designed and run to test the hypothesis that Japanese (U.S.) engineers are more (less) motivated to create new ideas when they are asked to preserve rather than change something. We will share the encouraging preliminary results and discuss implications. Engineers across different cultures have the capacity of both - create to change, and create to preserve. But different cultures emphasize different values. If engineering educators (and managers at organizations) of a certain sociocultural context celebrate their cultural values and restrict others, either consciously or not, this would put people with different values at disadvantage. With the salient power dynamics between educators (managers) and students (junior employees), this means alienation, misjudgment and disconnection. The paper underlies the importance for educators to learn about the different cultural forces behind different engineering behaviors. The research contributes to the cross-cultural literature of engineering education.",Ge X.; Misaki D.; Furue N.; Xu C.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,Tokyo University of Science;Kogakuin University;Stanford University,Creativity ;  Cross-cultural study ;  Cultural motivation ;  Culture of design education
Drivers and Impacts of a'Clean Slate' Foundational Engineering Curriculum Redesign at a Large Southwestern University,"This paper will address the research question: “What is the perceived impact and constructs of a 'clean slate' foundational engineering curriculum change at a large southwestern university?” The large southwestern university engineering leadership team chose to address the need for change using a deliberate “re-building strategy” [1]. This choice involved invoking “a process oriented approach to the remaking of a curriculum…, involving external stakeholders. This applies sound systems engineering principles to the engineering curriculum itself” [1]. “The re-building strategy…is a fundamental change of academic view linking academia with societal context and needs…by emphasizing a shared set of values, identity and commitment. It is about educating engineers who will become change agents after graduation, with an understanding of stakeholder needs and the wider societal impact of engineered systems within the innovation process' [1]. Although the need to re-build the curriculum was identified based on deficiencies, the desire to produce graduates equipped to impact society, or change agents, became the vision” [2]. This qualitative study shares multiple teaching assistant and instructor perspectives regarding the impact of the wholesale curriculum redesign, detail components of the newly created curriculum, and concludes with an exploration of a framework for addressing and managing the need to maintain an evolving curriculum going forward. Due to the many impacting factors over the past three years, such as layered deployment of student success courses and the challenges of the pandemic, limited time will be spent exploring the previous curriculum or performance metric comparisons among cohorts as isolating particular findings to attribute to the redesign would be questionable. As such, this paper will focus on the new program design and include insights from select instructors and teaching assistants that experienced both curriculums. “As further support of the tenets of the approach strategy, 'the development of the new first-year engineering program at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth began with a review of the education literature. The literature is consistent, and often overwhelming, in the following conclusions: • Active and collaborative learning techniques can result in higher performance and longer information retention compared to the traditional methods. • Integrating math, science, and engineering courses is an effective means to teaching students to deal successfully with cross-disciplinary problems” [2] [3].",Brooks R.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,Texas A&M University,
Global Engineering Competencies Learned Through Virtual Exchange Project Collaboration,"A virtual exchange involving 133 undergraduate STEM students in the US, Lebanon, Denmark, and Nepal was completed in the Summer of 2020. The goal of the program was to guide students through a collaborative design process where they experience working productively with people whose cultural backgrounds were different from their own. Groups of 4-5 students worked with a facilitator over 5-6 weeks. The course has an asynchronous and synchronous component to accommodate different time zones and schedules. A series of 5 video lectures guided students' learning along the design path. The students were directed to download a set of notes with blanks and encouraged to actively listen by filling in the notes while watching the lecture. The length of the video lectures ranges from 8 - 32 minutes. A set of 5 individual assignments (in the form of on-line quizzes) were created to support the asynchronous activities. After watching the video lecture, students are directed to complete a quiz. Responses to short-answer questions covered in the lecture and reflective exercises are collected. Students are given 1 week to complete the activity which can be asynchronously. For each of the 5 weeks the student team also worked on group assignments. Models and templates of the group assignments were created to help the student teams respond to the open-ended design process. The culminating activity for the team was to create a video presentation describing their healthcare innovation and the supporting research collected during the program. IRB approval was obtained, and subject informed consent was requested as a prerequisite to participation in this study. A global competency survey regarding “Cross-Cultural Collaboration” was requested from each participating student at the beginning and end of the program. Students were invited to participate in a one-on-one interview, and artifacts associated with the design process (both individual and group assignments) were collected. This paper discusses the students' assessment of the growth in global competency and collaboration skills. the transition from an in-person to a remote learning program, lessons learned from virtual exchange, and suggestions for future program designs.",Walter D.; Lavery M.; Fleishman B.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,Rose Hulman Institute Technology;Engineering World Health,
"Building a Sense of Community in a Multidisciplinary, Split-level Online Project-based Innovation Design Course","In March of 2020, faculty across the nation had to adapt their teaching methodologies due to the COVID 19 pandemic as universities across the country suspended face-to-face classes. This involved short-term solutions to complete the spring semester such as switching in-person lectures to synchronous lectures utilizing a university purchased platform. During the summer of 2020, many schools and courses saw record enrollment. Instructors were tasked with transitioning the once face-to-face class into a complete online environment of educational equivalence for the entirety of the course (unlike the partial transition during the spring semester). Most faculty are not trained in the pedagogical content knowledge related to designing, organizing, and maintaining an online course environment, yet were tasked with developing their summer courses in a short period of time. In addition to these sudden educational delivery changes, research findings indicate that supportive interventions to reduce loneliness should prioritize younger individuals during the COVID 19 pandemic [1]. This paper reviews the successful online transition of an in-person engineering innovation course that utilizes project based educational methods to an online environment during the summer of 2020 and the subsequent fall semester. In total, 174 undergraduate and graduate multidisciplinary engineering students completed this course in the new online format during the summer and 131 students took the course in the fall semester of 2020. Various methods were used to create a diverse and engaging learning experience for the students, while simultaneously creating a sense of community during a period of loneliness for many of the students. Anecdotal student feedback noted that the sense of community the course encouraged was one of the best aspects of the course. Two main ways the instructor helped to build this element of community was through the user experience and through course assignments.",White M.; Stowers M.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,University of Florida,
Developing an Engineering Design Course for Rural Middle School Students: Implementation Strategies and Lessons Learned,"In early 2020, a research collaboration between the College of Engineering and the Friday Institute for Educational Innovation at North Carolina State University (NCSU), the NC Mathematics and Science Education Network Pre-college Program (MSEN), a rural school district in NC, and the local advanced manufacturing industry began. The goal of this Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) project was to create community-based engineering design experiences for underserved middle school students (grades 6-8) from rural NC aimed to improve their cognitive (STEM content knowledge and career awareness) and non-cognitive (interest, self-efficacy, and STEM identity) outcomes, and ultimately lead to their increased participation in STEM fields, particularly engineering. The project leverages strategic partnerships to create a 3-part, grade-level specific Engineering Design and Exploration course that engages middle school students in authentic engineering design experiences that allow them to research, design, and problem-solve in a simulated advanced manufacturing environment. Shortly after receiving university approval to begin the research process, progress was halted due to an unprecedented global health crisis. The school district was closed for several weeks as administrators and teachers prepared to transition to remote learning. In addition, the district experienced unexpected teacher and administrator turnover. In the wake of such uncertainty, the project team has pivoted their research design to work more closely with industry partners while still maintaining an active relationship with the school district as they rebuild. This paper will describe the challenges faced, strategies employed, and lessons learned during the course development and implementation process.",Baldwin T.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,NC State University,
Podcasting in Geophysics Education: How to Learn Without Removing the Headphones,"The increasing use of information and communication technologies (ICT) has caused innumerable changes in today's society. While ICTs are also present in the classroom, the approach to content during class time retains its traditional structure. Innovative proposals aiming to change traditional methodology could be of great benefit for students, seeking to turn the student into the centre of their own learning. Among these innovative proposals, the Flipped Classroom has gained more relevance owing its success to the use of video, audio and text files that are sent out before the synchronous class actually meets so that students have prior access to contents, downloaded into their smartphones and accessed whenever and wherever they wish. This paper aims to investigate the benefits of using an innovation “Flipped Classroom + Podcast” in a Geophysics course for Geology students at a private Chilean university. A descriptive research approach is used to determine if the use of podcasts has a positive impact on students' attitudes and if they are perceived as a useful tool in knowledge building. The data was obtained at the end of a six-month period through validated instruments such as Student Satisfaction with Educational Podcasts Questionnaire (SSEPQ) and “Student Response to Instructional Practices” (StRIP). Results and implications of this pilot study are discussed at the end of this paper and point towards students attaining greater motivation and engagement. Such findings have triggered further longitudinal studies to be undertaken for 2021, whose results would be available in the coming months.",Zuniga-Robles H.; Truyol M.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,Universidad Andrés Bello,Flipped classroom ;  Geology ;  Higher education ;  ICT ;  Motivation ;  Podcast ;  Satisfaction

Predicting Interest in Engineering Majors: The Role of Critical Agency and Career Goals,"This research paper investigates how students' latent diversity influences students' disciplinary choices in engineering. Students bring interests, beliefs, and attitudes (i.e., latent diversity) to engineering education, shaping their environment and their classmates' experience. In turn, the cultural norms, standards, and structures within engineering culture convey implicit and explicit messages about particular ways of being, thinking, knowing that are valued. This dialectic process does not occur equitably; as students persist, the pressure to conform leads them to either norm, leave engineering, or labor to pioneer new spaces. And, this process is also entrenched in the history and process of engineering education that is raced, classed, and gendered. To add an additional layer of complexity, engineering is not a monolith with varying rates of participation by race and gender across engineering disciplines. Each engineering discipline has a unique culture and better understanding these differences can provide useful ways to change engineering disciplines to be more inclusive. It is in this complex landscape that this research begins to investigate how latent diversity may be linked to students' disciplinary pathways. First, we can identify opportunities to nurture ways of being, thinking, and knowing that would otherwise be pushed out (forms of latent diversity that are difficult to see but foster equity and inclusion nonetheless). Second, it can allow us to better tailor courses to fit students' interests and needs, thus increasing student belonging, innovation, and adoption of new ideas. To this end, we explore two research questions: (1) Do students' engineering beliefs, career priorities, and field interests predict interest across several disciplines of engineering?; and (2) Are the relationships between students' beliefs and discipline interests moderated by patterns of representation and parity? Data for this study were collected from 32 U.S. ABET-accredited institutions, with a total sample size of 3,711 undergraduate engineering students. We focused on students' career priorities (“How important are the following factors for your future career satisfaction?”), field interests (“Rate the likelihood of you choosing a career in each of the following fields?”), and engineering agency beliefs (“Engineering can improve our society” and “Engineering knowledge is for the advancement of human welfare”). Students were also asked to rate their current interest in seventeen disciplines (e.g., “biomedical engineering” and “industrial engineering”) and two additional categories (“other STEM-related” and “other non-STEM-related”). Our factor analysis identified nine constructs among the independent variables and clustered the disciplines into six categories. Regression analysis found some consistent relationships between variables, with the clearest connections between altruistic field and biochem-related engineering discipline interests (b =.33, p <.001) and commercial field and technology discipline interests (b =.20, p <.001). When focusing on technology and biochem disciplines, fields with opposing levels of gender parity, cis men reported a small positive relationship between altruistic field interests and technology discipline interest (b =.06, p =.005) while students with marginalized genders reported the opposite (b = -.10, p =.002).",Perkins H.; Benedict B.; Clements H.; Godwin A.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,Purdue University,
Industry-University Capstone Design: How Did Students Adapt to the COVID-19 Pandemic?,"A 2015 survey of 256 institutions from the US revealed that 70% of their capstone programs were funded by industry and government sponsors. This indicates the pervasiveness of capstone programs that partner with external sponsors to provide a “real-world” design experience to students. In this vein, the industry-sponsored Engineering Innovation and Entrepreneurship (ENGINE) capstone program was established at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at a large research university in the US. ENGINE is designed to provide a holistic and professional engineering experience to students in an educational setting, where student teams work on a six-month long project under the guidance of an industry and a faculty mentor. The program is overseen by a course instructor and teaching assistants who manage the course structure and expectations. This study compares student experiences in ENGINE during remote learning necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic to those in traditional, in-person learning. ENGINE students were surveyed in Spring 2018 and Spring 2020 to understand which components of the ENGINE program mattered most to student learning and how. Close-ended survey responses were analyzed using statistical methods and short answer questions were analyzed using qualitative methods in a sequential, mixed methods approach. Exploratory factor analysis of the Likert-scale items revealed that measures of instructional support and “real-world” experience contributed to student learning. No statistically significant differences in these measures between remote and traditional learning environments emerged. To address this lack of difference, a qualitative analysis was conducted to understand how the student capstone design experience changed during the pandemic. The qualitative analysis revealed that the lack of significant difference may be due to the fact that students rapidly adapted to the remote learning disruption. The results provide an insight into the various ways in which students acclimated to the crisis circumstances. These adaptations manifested in the form of product and process adaptations, in which students swiftly adjusted their final product or design process to respond to the evolving crisis. Students used various strategies such as changing team roles and ways of communication, using different tools and technology, and creative technical solutions to drive product and process adaptations.

"Augmented Reality Computer-aided Design Education (ARCADE) Tool to Improve Student Motivation, Engagement, and Spatial Cognition","Immersive technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) have become the worldwide huge technological innovations impacting on human life significantly. While the VR is an enclosed environment separated completely from the real world, AR allows users to merge the digital and physical worlds and enable the interaction between them. The wide usage of AR has led researchers to investigate its potential capability in several areas including STEM-related fields. Previous research shows that an AR assisted courses tend to enhance students' learning, spatial cognition, increase the students' motivation and engagement in learning process. In this study, the researchers have developed an AR application, named ARCADE to assist students with spatial cognition and remote course engagement independently. The ARCADE tool enables students to not only visualize the isometric product from its orthogonal views, but it also provides short tutorial clips how a specific feature was developed and what tools were' used. The students can perform basic modifications on the 3D part in the ARCADE such as section views, details views, scale, rotate and explode the assembly views. Although this project is a work in progress, the preliminary pretest and posttest results show there is a significant improvement in students' spatial cognition when the proposed tool is used to assist the course.",Dakeev U.; Pecen R.; Yildiz F.; Luong Y.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,Sam Houston State University,
Design the Future Activities (DFA): A Pedagogical Content Knowledge Framework in Engineering Design Education,"We propose an effective, innovative framework for developing content for design activities that address the challenges of the future where emerging technologies play a central role. Although engineering education research is concerned with preparing future engineers, the integration of future trends in technology with the engineering curriculum has been limited. We propose the Design the Future Activities (DFA) as a framework for systematically identifying and integrating emerging areas of research and technologies, such as artificial intelligence, into the teaching of engineering design. The core of developing and delivering the DFA framework is the teaching of the technology of artificial intelligence (AI). Because these technologies will change the nature of the future, we seek to engage with the ongoing discourse on the relationship between content (for design education) and pedagogy, through a proposed pedagogical content knowledge conceptual framework. Through a scholarship of integration that breaks the boundaries between disciplines, we propose a three-level framework: (1) Understanding technology analysis and system integration (to allow students to identify appropriate solutions given new technologies); (2) Making a value chain (or how these are appropriate solutions); and (3) Developing responsible innovations (or why these are appropriate solutions). While engineers continue to be creators and influencers of such technologies, the lack of understanding of the impact of their own technologies continues to cause an imbalanced innovation landscape, in education and in the workplace. We conclude that a new design approach to the engineering curriculum should be attempted, assuming that educators will systematically anticipate the future and recalibrate the curriculum.",Ali H.; Maynard A.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2021-07-26,Arizona State University Polytechnic Campus;Arizona State University,

The study of high resolution stereo mapping satellite,"This paper is targeted at the key and different technology appeared in system design and manufacture of high resolution stereo mapping satellite. On the basis of analyzing the development history and technical characteristic of mapping satellite both at home and abroad, and according to achievement of the high image positioning accuracy which is the key design of the mapping satellite, the paper shows the result of research about the design of high resolution stereo mapping satellite, such as design constraints, choose of the mapping system, and key and difficult points of design for both payload and platform products.The paper analyses the different special technique and engineering constraints of three line array camera system, two line array camera system, and single line array camera system. Since the satellite with single line array camera system can't fulfilling large area' mapping requirement, and it also have difficult on getting steady performance, the two or three line array camera systems are chosen by different contries' special satellites with main task of mapping the earth. Considering the carrying capacity of satellite platform, to get high precision and high resolution stereo image, the two line array camera system is thought to be the best choice at this time. The paper gives out the design elements and achievement methods for high image positioning accuracy, such as orbit measurement, attitude measure and control, time measure and synchronization, camera inner elements, and it also gives out the detail about the influence of every element.Then the paper gives the design of the GF-7 satellite which is designed according to two line array camera system, and is the first stereo mapping satellite with sub-meter level resolution of China. After gives out the performance requirements to the satellite, and its major components also was shown. The paper shows the technical innovation of satellite which is to fulfil the requirement of satellite mapping task, such as new mapping system with both active and passive imaging, high resolution mapping camera, new laser altimeter, high precision attitude measure and control system, and high speed date transmission ability.At last, the image quality test results about GF-7 satellite images are given out by difficult consumers, including: Ministry of Natural Resources, Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, and National Bureau of Statistics. The test results show that due to the research results which given out by this paper, GF-7 satellite works very well in orbit, the actual image positioning accuracy is better than initial requirement. The satellite image can be used to produce 1:10000 scale map, make investigation to city's three dimensional transportation, measure the highway's altitude, and check the variety of agricultural land. The satellite performance is better than the task's requirement, and reaches the world leading level.

Research on intelligent calculation model and method of precision land use/cover change information driven by high-resolution remote sensing,"Through the earth observation, the geographical phenomena, patterns, and evolutionary processes on the earth's surface can be fully reflected by the earth observation of remotely sensed imageries. The Land Use/Cover Change (LUCC) products from the High-resolution Remote Sensing (HSRS) data can provide full coverage, quantitative, and fast-updating background information for analyzing the law of spatial distribution of geographic features and their changing mechanisms. The development of HSRS is deeply driving the accuracy of LUCC information. At present, from the implementation effect of major survey projects such as national geographic conditions survey and natural resources survey deployed at the national level, the industrial production of LUCC information can be realized through the combination of human-computer interaction, in-house interpretation, and field survey. The development of high-resolution remote sensing is deeply driving the accuracy of LUCC information. How to improve the intelligent productivity of LUCC products through the innovation of theory and technology is an important bottleneck and key challenge.In the previous research, we put forward the basic concept of geo-parcel/geo-object based on the experience and mode of LUCC production in the departments of land investigation, and determined that the high-precision-level LUCC production is a gradually deepening cognitive process from external visual understanding to internal mechanism analysis. Therefore, this paper takes the geo-parcel as the basic unit of the cognition of land information of earth's surface, and further clarifies the meaning and geographical characteristics of LUCC.Based on the above background, we proposed a new concept of Precise LUCC (P-LUCC) in this paper, which integrates (accurate) quantitative index inversion model on the spatial structure of (fine) geo-parcels. First, this concept is a derivative of our developed spatial-spectrum cognitive theory, which is achieved by coupling HSRS visual features (TU-spatial maps) with multi-source and multi-modal observation mechanism features (PU-spectrum). Moreover, based on the geographical idea of ""the unity of five land features"", we further proposed a series of intelligent remote sensing information extraction methods for P-LUCC production. They are organized hierarchically in three kinds of models, i.e. stratified perception model, spatiotemporal synergistically inversion model, and multi-granular decision-making model. In this aspect, we analyzed the cooperative computing mechanism of three types of machine learning models, namely deep learning for visual perception, transfer learning of external knowledge integration, and reinforcement learning via incremental self-organizing. Multi-type learning algorithms based on these mechanism are organized and transformed organically by using the route of ""zoning partition-stratified extraction-graded transfer-functional reconstruction"". Thus, we designed a P-LUCC product production line for an information system of HSRS intelligent interpretation.Experiments were performed in the Suzhou High-tech Zone, China, and the accuracy and production efficiency of P-LUCC products were analyzed comprehensively. Through this large regional experimental verification, we show that our proposed technology has obvious advantages in the production accuracy and efficiency of LUCC products. Finally, we also provide some new ideas on thematic application based on P-LUCC information products. In conclusion, this intelligent production mode is worthy of popularization and application in engineering natural resources survey.",Luo J.; Hu X.; Wu T.; Liu W.; Xia L.; Yang H.; Sun Y.; Xu N.; Zhang X.; Shen Z.; Zhou N.,Journal,National Remote Sensing Bulletin,2021-07-25,Aerospace Information Research Institute;Chang'an University;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;Zhejiang University of Technology;Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences,Geo-parcel/TUPU ;  Intelligent computing ;  Machine learning ;  Precision LUCC ;  Spatial optimization ;  The unity of five land features
Integration of innovation & entrepreneurship concept with the teaching practice of biochemistry experiment,"Biochemistry experiment is an experimental module associated with biochemistry curriculum. In the context of deepening the education reform on innovation & entrepreneurship, integrating the concept of innovation & entrepreneurship with the experimental course is an effective way for the biology discipline to foster professional talents with strong engineering ability and innovation & entrepreneurship ability. Outcome-based education (OBE) is a new concept for education. Guided by this concept, we encouraged students to propose and take part in research projects, redesigned the time frame for research project-based experiment teaching, and implemented a multi-dimensional evaluation system along the entire teaching process. Furthermore, we integrated the concept of innovation & entrepreneurship for training undergraduates during the teaching process of biochemistry experiment. These measures not only boosted the students' interest in research and innovation, but also guided the teachers to participate in the entire process, which helped improving the engineering ability and innovation & entrepreneurship ability of the students.",Dong F.; Liu X.; Yu Z.; Gu Y.; Zhang L.; Tang W.,Journal,Shengwu Gongcheng Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Biotechnology,2021-07-25,Guizhou Institute of Technology,Biochemistry experiment ;  Innovation and entrepreneurship education reform ;  Outcome-based education ;  Undergraduate teaching engineering
The impact of environmental regulation on the industrial structure transformation of resource-based cities,"Based on 115 resource-based cities in China from 2003 to 2016, this paper studied the impact of environmental regulation on the transformation of industrial structure and the mediation effect of green technology innovation in this process by using fixed effect model and mediation effect model. It was found that, as a whole, the rationalization and optimization of industrial structure could be promoted by the implementation of formal environmental regulation and informal environmental regulation, and the implementation effect of informal environmental regulation was more significant. Furthermore, green technology innovation played an intermediary role in promoting the transformation of industrial structure by environmental regulation. After a series of robustness tests, the conclusions were still valid. Based on the perspective of urban growth cycles, the effects of formal environmental regulation and informal environmental regulation on the rationalization and optimization of the industrial structure shown significant differences with different urban growth cycles. Meanwhile, the mediation effect of green technology innovation in the process of environmental regulation in the transformation of industrial structure was obviously inconsistent with different urban growth cycles. In 2013~2016, the effect of formal and informal environmental regulation on the rationalization and optimization of industrial structure was improved compared with that of 2003~2012, and green technology innovation had mediation effect in promoting the optimization of industrial structure by environmental regulation.",Qin B.; Yu R.; Ge L.,Journal,Zhongguo Huanjing Kexue/China Environmental Science,2021-07-20,Shanghai University of Finance and Economics;Fudan University;University of Shanghai for Science and Technology,Formal environmental regulation ;  Green technology innovation ;  Informal environmental regulation ;  Optimization of industrial structure ;  Rationalization of industrial structure

This study concludes that the main strategy to achieve a jump in productivity (from 8.25 t/ha to > 16.5 t/ha) through the application of Proliga technology innovation in Karo District was the use of healthy seeds, site-specific fertilization and Bemisia border installation since the beginning of planting.",Tobing S.; Sipahutar T.; Simatupang S.; Girsang M.; Nurfaida.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,2021-07-15,Hasanuddin University;Assessment Institute for Agricultural Technology North Sumatra,
Challenges and next steps in the advancement of immunotherapy: Summary of the 2018 and 2020 National Cancer Institute workshops on cell-based immunotherapy for solid tumors,"Cell-based immunotherapies have had remarkable success in the clinic, specifically in the treatment of hematologic malignancies. However, these strategies have had limited efficacy in patients with solid tumors. To better understand the challenges involved, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) convened an initial workshop with immuno-oncology thought leaders in December 2018 and a follow-up workshop in December 2020. The goals of the NCI workshops on cell-based immunotherapy for solid tumors were to discuss the current state of the field of cell-based immunotherapy, obtain insights into critical knowledge gaps, and identify ways in which NCI could facilitate progress. At both meetings, subjects emphasized four main types of challenges in further developing cell-based immunotherapy for patients with solid tumors: scientific, technical, clinical, and regulatory. The scientific barriers include selecting appropriate targets, ensuring adequate trafficking of cell therapy products to tumor sites, overcoming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and identifying appropriate models for these investigations. While mouse models may provide some useful data, the majority of those that are commonly used are immunodeficient and unable to fully recapitulate the immune response in patients. There is therefore a need for enhanced support of small early-phase human clinical studies, preferably with adaptive trial designs, to provide proof of concept for novel cell therapy approaches. Furthermore, the requirements for manufacturing, shipping, and distributing cell-based therapies present technical challenges and regulatory questions, which many research institutions are not equipped to address. Overall, workshop subjects identified key areas where NCI support might help the research community in driving forward innovation and clinical utility: 1) provide focused research support on topics such as tumor target selection, immune cell fitness and persistence, cell trafficking, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment; 2) support the rapid translation of preclinical findings into proof of concept clinical testing, harmonize clinical trial regimens, and facilitate early trial data sharing (including negative results); 3) expand manufacturing support for cell therapies, including vectors and reagents, and provide training programs for technical staff; and 4) develop and share standard operating procedures for cell handling and analytical assays, and work with the Food and Drug Administration to harmonize product characterization specifications.",Fogli L.; Aurigemma R.; Sommers C.; Singh A.; Bourcier K.; Ernstoff M.,Journal,Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer,2021-07-15,National Cancer Institute (NCI),adoptive ;  cell therapy ;  chimeric antigen ;  immunotherapy ;  lymphocytes ;  receptors ;  T-lymphocytes ;  tumor-infiltrating

Property Driven Design based Verification for Register Transfer Level Hardware,"The amount of features that could be put on a chip grew as a result of many innovations and developments. As a result, much more functional complexity is created. This motivates the need for architectural advancements with increased productivity. The 'Property-Driven Design (PDD)' approach for Register Transfer Level i.e., RTL hardware is described in this paper, which begins with aconceptual interface model and introduces property checking early in the design process. The proposed PDD approach generates abstracts properties from system architecture and uses them during the design phase to save time and effort on property testing. The new approach has a major benefit in that it provides an explicitly sound device model in addition to the RTL definition. By simplifying some complex research and evaluation activities in today's modern design flows, this helps to emancipate system-level models from mere models to golden concept models. Path predicate abstraction (PPA) produces time and abstract system models that could be combined to form abstract modeling techniques.",Aarthi R.; Aishwarya C.; Akash M.; Krupasankar P.; Yadukrishnan G.; Anita J.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Communication and Electronics Systems, ICCES 2021",2021-07-08,"Amrita School of Engineering, Coimbatore",Assertions ;  Path Predicate Abstraction (PPA) ;  Property-Driven Design(PDD) ;  Refinement ;  Register transfer level(RTL) ;  System-level design ;  Verification

Midstream players determine population-level behavior change: Social marketing research to increase demand for lead-free components in pitcher pumps in madagascar,"Lead (Pb) exposure through water contamination is an important issue at the intersection of public health and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH). Behavior-change programs designed to address this pressing problem rarely take a behavioral-science-informed approach, nor do they consider the role of intermediate players who often influence and support behavior change. Social marketing segments the population and focuses on the consumer/user throughout program development and implementation. To illustrate the social marketing process, this cross-sectional, qualitative design study investigates the use of Pb in the construction and maintenance of household pitcher pumps for potable water in Madagascar. A sample of 18 technicians were interviewed on their current practices, motivators, barriers, and communication channels for knowledge exchange. The results reveal the importance of peers, those considered experts or “market mavens”, and the need for information on the dangers of Pb as an outdated practice for any future intervention. This study advances the notion of a design shift within engineering WASH projects, whereby social/behavioral approaches are used to consider the needs, concerns, and current behaviors of the consumer. We also advocate for engaging intermediate players who often influence behavior change in the rollout of an engineering innovation.",Khaliq M.; Sommariva S.; Buerck A.; Rakotondrazaka R.; Rakotoarisoa L.; Barrett L.; Mihelcic J.,Journal,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2021-07-02,College of Engineering;University of South Florida Health;ONG Ranontsika,Behavior change ;  Communication ;  Groundwater ;  Lead exposure ;  Social change ;  Social marketing ;  Sub-Saharan Africa
Metabolic engineering. In the shadow of genetic engineering,"This article aims to question the reducing of the process of molecularization of life to its informational dimension from the 1970s and 1980s through reintegration of a chemical ontology of life. The characteristic feature of this chemical ontology is the centrality of production issues and a high proximity with industry. Our paper investigates the visibility and characterization of chemical molecularization of life from the birth and stabilization of a little-known scientific field, namely metabolic engineering. To this end our work combined a scientometric analysis of a corpus of 6,288 scientific papers, archives from a research center and a series of semi-structured interviews with several key figures in metabolic engineering. Through the study of this scientific field, we describe a chemical molecularization of life process, a) based on classical entities in biochemistry (enzymes, metabolic pathways), b) supported by innovation policies inspired from chemical engineering and c) involving scientists highly committed with industry, as in chemical engineering. Chemical molecularization has expanded in the shadow of informational molecularization, which is not ignored, but 'integrated' as resources for maintaining the competitiveness of existing industries, innovation policies and scientific practices.",Raimbault B.,Journal,Natures Sciences Societes,2021-07-01,IFRIS,Biochemistry ;  Molecularization of life ;  Relations between science and industry ;  Research ;  Technologies
Strategies for promoting globally competitive engineering education in India,"In the last ten years, there is a growing chorus of discontent about what is not happing in the engineering education in India. Around 5 % of the engineering graduates are possessing required industry -relevant skills and competencies. All over the world major efforts are being undertaken to transforming the engineering education. Based on the research, it is suggested to improve the performance of the faculty members, their abilities to undertake the globalization of engineering education and digitalization. Further there is a need for improving the faculty evelopment through flexible and blended programs under NITTTRs, NITs, State Technical Universities, modernization of curricula and instructional design and collaboration with the industry and government. The colleges are to network with well performing global universities and collaborate in research and development. There is an urgent need for Institute-Industry-Government Partnership for improving the curriculum, research methods and product innovation. The institutes can review their curriculum through Faculty-Alumni- Industry-Representatives of Entrepreneurs (FAIR) Committee once in a year and make improvements. The engineering students are to be exposed to the problems of the industries and they are to be coached to solve them. Their research work, dissertations have to be industry relevant. Further, the engineering institutes have to plan innovative products as a part of the capstone projects.

Determining the Smart Specialization of Russian Regions in the Context of Domestic and European Experience,"Abstract—: The relevance of applied engineering of new development mechanisms for Russian regions is due to the ineffectiveness of innovative strategies currently in force and isolation of scientific and technological development from the sectoral potential of the territories. Russia’s Spatial Development Strategy until 2025, approved in 2019, led to a conflict between promising sectoral economic specializations and the real problems of different types of territories. The “smart specialization” approach may take the lead in aligning the sectoral and territorial approaches. The article describes the differences between traditional and smart specializations. It is shown that in the case of smart specialization, it is not the selection of individual sectors as “points” that takes place, but determination of the set of types of economic activity in conjunction with regional competencies as a fuzzy core with blurred boundaries. The characteristics of the sectoral, patent, innovation, and publishing components as integral parts of the developed methodological approach, are given. All components are linked through the priorities of the Science and Technology Development Strategy, which plays the role of a national research platform (program) reflecting the long-term priorities of the economy and society. The coordinated choice of regional development prospects solves the problem of isolated technological forecasts for territories. Coordination of sectoral and scientific and technological priorities for a territory can be considered the basis for selecting regional investment projects. This will allow the federal executive authorities to set a general framework for the most desirable goals of scientific and technological development in a spatial context, and to take on venture risks with the support of technology start-ups and emerging sectors.",Kotov A.,Journal,Regional Research of Russia,2021-07-01,"The Institute of Europe, Russian Academy of Sciences",matrix of investment project selection ;  smart specialization ;  spatial development strategy

Driving Characteristics and Simulation of High-speed Rail to Science and Technology Innovation in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region,"Research purposes: Crisscrossing network of high-speed rail is an important support for factor connectivity and the pulse of regional collaborative innovation. Based on the revised gravity model and social network analysis method, this paper studies the connection characteristics of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region science and technology innovation in the case of high-speed rail and non-high-speed rail, and then uses system dynamics to simulate the impact of high-speed rail attributes on Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei science and technology innovation in the region. Research conclusions:(1) The regional scientific and technological connection in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region has been significantly strengthened under the condition of high-speed rail. (2) The SD simulation results with the delay function show that with the change of time, the promotion effect of high-speed railway service on regional scientific and technological innovation ability is gradually improved, which indicates that high-speed railway has a certain delay feature in promoting regional scientific and technological innovation. However, delay has a negative effect on the system of scientific and technological innovation, which may weaken the immediate effect of regional scientific and technological innovation achievements. (3) The addition of step function shows that increasing the mileage density of high-speed railway has a promoting effect on scientific and technological innovation, and makes the number of scientific and technological innovation increase, and the increase percentage gradually increases. (4) The research results can provide reference for decision-making of spatial allocation and optimal management of high-speed railway construction resources.",Zhu T.; Xu Y.; Han J.; Ge Y.,Journal,Journal of Railway Engineering Society,2021-07-01,Shijiazhuang Tiedao University,Driving force of high-speed rail ;  Innovation network ;  Science and technology innovation ;  System dynamics

Design Engineering in the Age of Industry 4.0,"Industry 4.0 is based on the digitization of manufacturing industries and has raised the prospect for substantial improvements in productivity, quality, and customer satisfaction. This digital transformation not only affects the way products are manufactured but also creates new opportunities for the design of products, processes, services, and systems. Unlike traditional design practices based on system-centric concepts, design for these new opportunities requires a holistic view of the human (stakeholder), artefact (product), and process (realization) dimensions of the design problem. In this paper we envision a “human-cyber-physical view of the systems realization ecosystem,” termed “Design Engineering 4.0 (DE4.0),” to reconceptualize how cyber and physical technologies can be seamlessly integrated to identify and fulfil customer needs and garner the benefits of Industry 4.0. In this paper, we review the evolution of Engineering Design in response to advances in several strategic areas including smart and connected products, end-to-end digital integration, customization and personalization, data-driven design, digital twins and intelligent design automation, extended supply chains and agile collaboration networks, open innovation, co-creation and crowdsourcing, product servitization and anything-as-a-service, and platformization for the sharing economy. We postulate that DE 4.0 will account for drivers such as Internet of Things, Internet of People, Internet of Services, and Internet of Commerce to deliver on the promise of Industry 4.0 effectively and efficiently. Further, we identify key issues to be addressed in DE 4.0 and engage the design research community on the challenges that the future holds.",Jiao R.; Commuri S.; Panchal J.; Milisavljevic-Syed J.; Allen J.; Mistree F.; Schaefer D.,Journal,Journal of Mechanical Design,2021-07-01,"College of Engineering;The George W.

Driver's Acceptance of Cooperative Vehicle Infrastructure System Based on Extended TAM,"The cooperative vehicle infrastructure system (CVIS) has been regarded as an advanced technology and a research focus in the field of intelligent transportation. Countries worldwide are committed to the research and development, testing, demonstration applications, and utility evaluation of CVIS. However, the service object of CVIS is the driver; therefore, it is of great importance to study the driver's subjective acceptance of CVIS and its influencing factors before CVIS is officially applied. The basic technology acceptance model (TAM) was used as the theoretical framework in this study. Using the four basic variables (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude, and intention), as well as four extended variables (quality of warning service, distraction perception, personal innovation, and trustworthiness), an extended TAM was used to analyze the driver's subjective acceptance of CVIS and its influencing factors. First, an online CVIS questionnaire was sent to 392 drivers. Second, Cronbach's α and confirmatory factor analysis were used to inspect the reliability and validity of the questionnaire. Finally, path analysis was used to explore the driver's acceptance of CVIS and its influencing factors. The results show that the relationship among the basic TAM variables is consistent with the basic model assumptions. The quality of the CVIS warning service indirectly affects usage intentions through perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and attitude. The driver's distracted perception of CVIS has no negative effect on his attitude and usage intention. The driver's personal innovation not only directly affects the usage intention, but also indirectly influences usage intention through attitude. The driver's trust in CVIS is a direct influencing factor of usage intention, and indirectly affects usage intention through other variables. The results contribute to understanding the driver's acceptance of CVIS and its influencing factors and provide theoretical support for the design of CVIS.",Li Z.; Xing G.; Li J.; Zhao X.; Zhang J.,Journal,Zhongguo Gonglu Xuebao/China Journal of Highway and Transport,2021-07-01,Beijing University of Technology,CVIS ;  Distraction perception ;  Path analysis ;  Personal innovativeness ;  Quality of the warning service ;  TAM ;  Traffic engineering ;  Trust
"Parallel tunneling: Intelligent control and key technologies for tunneling, supporting and anchoring based on ACP theory","Although intelligent drivage technology has made some progress, and the prototype design of shield type and anchor-excavation type excavation-bolt-anchor multi-equipment are presented, from the equipment applicability and equipment matching point of view, there are still many problems, such as un-rigorous individual equipment design, high cost of prototype modification, inaccurate equipment control, diverse heading scenes, un-adaptability to group equipment and difficult coordination. The primary reason for the above problems is the lack of basic theoretical research on group equipment linkage and collaborative control under the special production environment of coal mine, which is mainly manifested in the lack of basic theoretical research on equipment model, scene experiment and data drive required by intelligent drivage. The modeling of drivage complex system is difficult and the experiment is insufficient. Therefore, the research idea of parallel drivage system is put forward for the first time, trying to solve the existing problems of intelligent drivage with a kind of calculation theory and method suitable for complex system. Some large-scale computational models are used to predict and induce complex system phenomena by integrating artificial social computing experiments and parallel systems to form a new computing research system. Taking the intelligent drivage complex system as the research object, this paper focuses on the overall control theory and method of the excavation support anchor system, combines with the relevant research basis and method of intelligent drivage, integrates the latest research progress of complex system, is based on the basic theory of parallel control and ACP (artificial, computing, parallel) method framework, and applies multi-agent research method based on agent control and adaptive dynamic programming. Also, it presents the research on the parallel control theory and method of excavation-bolt-anchor for intelligent drivage complex system, current situation of discrete control of group equipment in complex environment of roadway. Based on the holistic system theory, the agent model of the drivage support group equipment of the drivage system is constructed. According to the calculation experiment of the complex system under multiple scenes, the engineering verification problem of the complex and bad environment of roadway was overcome. Finally, the theory innovation and method verification of intelligent drivage parallel control method are realized.",Yang J.; Ge S.; Wang F.; Luo W.; Zhang Y.; Hu X.; Zhu T.; Wu M.,Journal,Meitan Xuebao/Journal of the China Coal Society,2021-07-01,"China University of Mining & Technology, Beijing;Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences;Ltd.",ACP theory ;  Agent model ;  Intelligent driving ;  Parallel control ;  Parallel tunneling ;  Tunneling supporting and anchoring
Determining the critical factors of air-conditioning innovation using an integrated model of fuzzy Kano-QFD during the COVID-19 pandemic: The perspective of air purification,"At present, people are demanding better indoor air quality during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to maintaining the basic functions, new air-conditioning should also add air purification functions to improve indoor air quality and reduce the possibility of virus transmission. Nowadays, there is lack of research results on the innovation of air-conditioning. The aim of this study is to present a two-stage mathematical model for identifying critical manufacturing factors in the innovation process of air conditioning. In this paper, Kano and quality function deployment (QFD) are used to analyze the critical factors affecting air-conditioning innovation. Some studies have proposed using Kano-QFD model to analyze product innovation, but the study only studies one stage, which loses the analysis of the subsequent stages of product innovation. Based on this, this paper studies the priority method of two-stage critical factors for air-conditioning innovation. Firstly, the questionnaire survey and fuzzy sets are used to collect demand information of multi-agent (customers and professional technicians). Secondly, the Kano model is used to classify and calculate satisfaction of multi-agent. Then, QFD is used to transform multi-agent demands into engineering property indexes (first stage) and technical property indexes (second stage) and calculate the weight of each index. Finally, the applicability and superiority of this method is illustrated by taking the central air-conditioning as an example.",Yu Y.; Li C.; Yang W.; Xu W.,Journal,PLoS ONE,2021-07-01,Shenyang University of Technology;Jinan University,
"Internet access standards: Dissemination of the integrated services digital network in spain, 1984-2005","This article aims to narrate the birth and evolution of the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) in Spain with an essentially descriptive methodology, from an interdisciplinary perspective and from varied sources. The study aims to investigate the forms of the transition from a conceptual or engineering phase to the market in a standard of Internet access and, at the same time, in the different patterns of technological innovation and the factors that motivate them. It tries to verify if the own nature of the techniques, the degree of diffusion of the previous technologies, the technological level-digitalization-and the structure of market of the telecommunications — continued existence of the monopoly of the historical operator National Telephone Company of Spain — had a significant impact on the inequality of penetration with respect to other countries.

How local industry R&D shapes academic research: Evidence from the agricultural biotechnology revolution,"This paper investigates how industry research and development (R&D) may shape the rate and direction of research at geographically proximate universities and explores the mechanisms leading to such geographical localization of industry influence. Endogeneity concerns related to the selection of industry location were addressed by using the unique setting of the agricultural biotechnology revolution of the 1980s. The emergence of plant biotechnology spurred the entry of nonbiotechnology agribusiness incumbents into genetic engineering, creating a quasi-natural experiment for universities located near the company R&D headquarters. Relative to the control universities identified by coarsened exact matching, the universities within a 50-mile radius of the incumbent R&D headquarters show an approximate 28.5% increase in industry-relevant research output after the company's entry into agricultural biotechnology R&D. The effect of industry R&D is stronger for research on major cash crops. Additional analysis suggests that local university-industry coauthorships, which proxy for local industry funding, may be a leading mechanism behind the effect. Overall, the results highlight the roles of R&D-intensive anchor tenants in the geography of academic knowledge production. The findings are relevant for regional policymakers and managers considering strategic placements of corporate R&D locations.",Sohn E.,Journal,Organization Science,2021-07-01,Scheller College of Business,Agricultural biotechnology ;  Geography of innovation ;  Industry R&D ;  Knowledge spillovers ;  University-industry relationship
Mathematics in Engineering Education: a Review of the Recent Literature with a View towards Innovative Practices,"The aim of the special issue is to bring together important current international research on innovative teaching and learning practices in mathematics in engineering education, and to develop deeper understandings of the characteristics of current teaching and learning practices that can inform the design and implementation of future innovative practice. The focus of this review paper is to provide a state-of-the-art overview of this emerging field at the cross-roads between mathematics and engineering education, in addition to introducing the papers of this special issue. To guide this paper, we posed three review questions: (1) How can current (teaching/learning/study) practices of mathematics in engineering education be characterized with a view towards innovation?; (2) What are the ‘resources’ (cognitive, material, digital, social) used, and what are those that appear also well suited for innovative courses?; (3) What are promising innovative practices in mathematics in engineering education, and what are the implications for curriculum reform? Looking back across the studies we summarized in the review, we conclude that they are lagging behind the more fundamental changes that are happening in engineering education, whilst addressing selected aspects of innovative changes within the current system of engineering education. At the same time, the nine papers of this special issue contribute new perspectives for innovative practices in mathematics in engineering education, for a better understanding of current practices and for future research.",Pepin B.; Biehler R.; Gueudet G.,Journal,International Journal of Research in Undergraduate Mathematics Education,2021-07-01,Technische Universiteit Eindhoven;Paderborn University;Université de Bretagne Occidentale,Innovative teaching and learning practices ;  Mathematics in engineering education ;  Resources ;  State-of-the-art literature review
"Sustainable construction investment, real estate development, and covid-19: A review of literature in the field","Aspects of sustainable construction investment and real estate development (CIRED) and their interrelations during the period pre-, intra-, and post-COVID-19, are presented in the research. Applications of the topic model, environmental psychology theory, building life cycle method, and certain elements of bibliometrics, webometrics, article level metrics, altmetrics, and scientometrics make it possible to perform a quantitative analysis on CIRED. The CIRED topic model was developed in seven steps. This paper aims to present a literature review on CIRED throughout the pandemic and to look at the responses from the real estate and construction sector. This sector is a field that appears to be rapidly expanding, judging from the volume of current research papers. This review focuses on last year’s leading peer-reviewed journals. A combination of various keywords was applied for the review and the criteria for paper selections included construction investment, real estate development, civil engineering, COVID-19, and sustainability, as well as residential, industrial, commercial, land, and special purpose real estate, along with their risks, strategies, and trends. The articles reviewed for this paper, which analyzes three hypotheses, look at pre-, intra-, and post-pandemic CIRED. The three hypotheses were validated by analyzing scientific publications from around the world. Two innovative elements make this study stand out among the most advanced research on pre-, intra-, and post-pandemic CIRED. The first of the two innovations is the integrated analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19-related national policies, and business investment strategies relevant to CIRED and the interests of investors as well as on the impact a CIRED policy and investors make on the spread of COVID-19. In addition, this research demonstrates a marked increase in the effectiveness of a CIRED analysis, when the life cycle of a CIRED, the involved stakeholders with their own individual interests, the COVID-19 situation, and the external micro-, meso-, and macro-environments are covered comprehensively as a single entity.",Kaklauskas A.; Zavadskas E.; Lepkova N.; Raslanas S.; Dauksys K.; Vetloviene I.; Ubarte I.,Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2021-07-01,Vilniaus Gedimino Technikos Universitetas,Construction and real estate markets ;  Construction investments ;  COVID-19 pandemic ;  Real estate development ;  Review ;  Risk and strategies ;  Sustainability ;  Trends
Exploring the impact of an NSERC CREATE program on job readiness among science and engineering graduate students and postdoctoral fellows,"The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of an NSERC CREATE program on job readiness among highly qualified personnel (HQP) in chemistry and chemical engineering, which in this paper refers to three groups: MSc students, PhD students, and postdoctoral fellows (PDFs). HQP in science and engineering are faced with numerous opportunities for employment, but they are not well-trained to pursue these opportunities. The CREATE program aims to prepare HQP for a wider range of career options within the Canadian workforce by providing technical and professional training to enable HQP to develop the skills needed for the job market. This training is delivered in various formats such as workshops, courses, panel discussions, lab demonstrations, and innovation fairs which are suited to the needs of the HQP. The authors of this paper used a qualitative case study approach to explore the impact the CREATE program has on HQP's job readiness. Thirty-five semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect data from the program HQP. Three themes emerged from the analyzed data. One of the study findings indicated that the technical and professional training provided by the CREATE program helped HQP develop the basic skills required to enter the job market. However, some participants felt that the program only facilitated their skill development, not their job readiness. The participants stated that universities should facilitate job fairs to provide opportunities for them to meet with professionals from the government, academia, and industry. Additional research is required to examine the impact of the CREATE program by using a larger sample and different program components.",Abulhassn A.; Roberts E.,Journal,Education for Chemical Engineers,2021-07-01,University of Calgary,Career options ;  Chemical engineering MSc and PhD students ;  Employability ;  Job readiness ;  PDFs
"Omics, epigenetics, and genome editing techniques for food and nutritional security","The incredible success of crop breeding and agricultural innovation in the last century greatly contributed to the Green Revolution, which significantly increased yields and ensures food security, despite the population explosion. However, new challenges such as rapid climate change, deteriorating soil, and the accumulation of pollutants require much faster responses and more effective solutions that cannot be achieved through traditional breeding. Further prospects for increasing the efficiency of agriculture are undoubtedly associated with the inclusion in the breeding strategy of new knowledge obtained using high-throughput technologies and new tools in the future to ensure the design of new plant genomes and predict the desired phenotype. This article provides an overview of the current state of research in these areas, as well as the study of soil and plant microbiomes, and the prospective use of their potential in a new field of microbiome engineering.

The methodology was performed through a bibliometric analysis using the Scopus database, focusing on AR's educational uses. Engineering education is the primary research trend, followed by simulation, tracking, and virtual reality. Education and e-learning also have leading roles within this analysis, along with gamification and human-computer interaction, whose impacts are further explored.

Technological Advances in Penile Implant Surgery,"Background: During the last century, surgical management of erectile dysfunction has evolved from an experimental concept to a core treatment modality with widespread use among the men's health community. Over time, innovations in materials, mechanical design elements, device coatings, and surgical technique have provided patients with low-risk, reliable, and reproducible erectile function with high satisfaction rates. Aim: To provide a foundation for future innovation by improving understanding of historical penile prosthetics and the rationale behind incremental technological improvements for the contemporary Men's Health physician. Methods: Literature review was conducted to generate a comprehensive review of historical technological innovations in penile implant surgery. Companies with FDA approved penile prosthetics in use in the United States were contacted for information regarding technological innovations in the past and future devices in development. A separate literature review was performed to identify any significant future device design elements being tested, even in the ex vivo setting, which may have future clinical applications. Outcomes: Technological innovations in penile implant surgery were described. Results: Current options for the prosthetic surgeon include malleable penile prostheses (MPP), self-contained (2-piece) inflatable penile prostheses, and multicomponent (3-piece) inflatable penile prostheses. Current MPPs consist of a synthetic coated solid core which allow for manipulation of the penis for concealability while maintaining sufficient axial rigidity to achieve penetration when desired. Multi-component (3-Piece) IPPs currently include the Coloplast Titan and Boston Scientific/AMS 700 which consist of a fluid reservoir, intrascrotal pump, and intracavernosal cylinders. The devices have undergone numerous design updates to the cylinders, pump, reservoir, tubing, and external coatings to increase reliability and decrease short- and long-term complications. Clinical Implications: Future innovations in penile prosthetic surgery seek to broaden the indications and applicability to the transgender community and improve both safety and functionality for patient and partner. Strengths & Limitations: The review is limited primarily to penile prosthetics approved for current or historical clinical use in the United States and may not be representative of the global prosthetic environment. Additionally, the research and development of future innovations, particularly those provided by device manufacturers, is likely limited by non-disclosure to maintain a competitive advantage. Conclusions: Penile prosthetic surgery will undoubtedly remain integral to the treatment of erectile dysfunction, and education regarding the current state of technological innovation will empower the prosthetic surgeon and biomedical engineering community to improve contemporary patient care and drive the development of the next generation of implantable penile prosthetics.

3D and 4D lithography of untethered microrobots,"In the last decades, additive manufacturing (AM), also called three-dimensional (3D) printing, has advanced micro/nano-fabrication technologies, especially in applications like lightweight engineering, optics, energy, and biomedicine. Among these 3D printing technologies, two-photon polymerization (TPP) offers the highest resolution (even at the nanometric scale), reproducibility and the possibility to create monolithically 3D complex structures with a variety of materials (e.g. organic and inorganic, passive and active). Such active materials change their shape upon an applied stimulus or degrade over time at certain conditions making them dynamic and reconfigurable (also called 4D printing). This is particularly interesting in the field of medical microrobotics as complex functions such as gentle interactions with biological samples, adaptability when moving in small capillaries, controlled cargo-release profiles, and protection of the encapsulated cargoes, are required. Here we review the physics, chemistry and engineering principles of TPP, with some innovations that include the use of micromolding and microfluidics, and explain how this fabrication schemes provide the microrobots with additional features and application opportunities. The possibility to create microrobots using smart materials, nano- and biomaterials, for in situ chemical reactions, biofunctionalization, or imaging is also put into perspective. We categorize the microrobots based on their motility mechanisms, function, and architecture, and finally discuss the future directions of this field of research.",Rajabasadi F.; Schwarz L.; Medina-Sánchez M.; Schmidt O.,Journal,Progress in Materials Science,2021-07-01,Technische Universität Dresden;Technische Universität Chemnitz;Leibniz-Institut für Festkörper- und Werkstoffforschung Dresden,3D Laser Lithography ;  4D ;  Micromotors ;  Microrobots ;  Smart Materials ;  Soft Robotics ;  Stimuli-responsive ;  Two-photon polymerization
A bibliographic analysis of 20 years of research on innovation and new product development in technology and innovation management (TIM) journals,"In this perspectives article, we analyze 20 years of research on the topics of “innovation management” and “new product development” in the technology and innovation management (TIM) domain. More specifically, we investigate the questions related to three issues: (i) Performance: Which authors, institutions, countries, journals, and papers have been most productive (number of papers) and most influential (number of citations)? (ii) Networks: What are the links between authors, between countries, between institutions, between journals and co-citation? (iii) Attention: What has been the shift in research attention (i.e., stated keywords) over time? To do this, we use the VOSViewer bibliographic method to assess the domain's performance and its changes in research attention and present maps of the knowledge structure and networks. Our study adds to and improves upon previous bibliometric reviews in terms of extensivity (i.e., data from 7,612 papers), scope, and accuracy. In addition to the descriptive evaluations of the domain, we also suggest several implications from these results. For performance, we highlight a weak link between productive authors and influential authors, which could be explained by productive authors being part of extensive co-authorship networks, being selective and publishing less but in the highest quality journals, and working in countries with institutions that pioneer research on the topic (and conversely, less influential authors working in countries with an incentive structure that rewards quantity but not quality). Our network results help explain that collaborations are linked to research productivity rather than influential research. Further, our network results reveal collaborations based on country linkages that might create research echo chambers in which research attention is augmented or reinforced by a geographical network. From our results on research attention, we discuss how the dominant keywords are restricted to TIM topics and highly influenced by seminal papers and authors outside the TIM domain. Thus, the field is predominantly inward-looking, drawing from other cognate business and management fields, and hardly drawing from other academic fields. These findings elucidate and extend the concerns other innovation management scholars have raised, noting that the lack of varied and cooperative authorship within the TIM domain has led to stale, repeated methods and metrics in TIM papers, potentially reducing the field's future influence. We conclude by outlining some adverse implications of our paper.

Using random forest analysis to identify student demographic and high school-level factors that predict college engineering major choice,"Background: Given the importance of engineers to a nation's economy and potential innovation, it is imperative to encourage more students to consider engineering as a college major. Previous studies have identified a broad range of high school experiences and demographic factors associated with engineering major choice; however, these factors have rarely been ranked or ordered by relative importance. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study leveraged comprehensive, longitudinal data to identify which high school-level factors, including high school characteristics and student high school experiences as well as student demographic characteristics and background, rank as most important in terms of predictive power of engineering major choice. Design/Method: Using data from a nationally representative survey, the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, and the random forest method, a genre of machine learning, the most important high school-level factors in terms of predictive power of engineering major choice were ranked. Results: Random forest results indicate that student gender is the most important variable predicting engineering major choice, followed by high school math achievement and student beliefs and interests in math and science during high school. Conclusions: Gender differences in engineering major choice suggest wider ranging cultural phenomena that need further investigation and systemic interventions. Research findings also highlight two other areas for potential interventions to promote engineering major choice: high school math achievement and beliefs and interests in math and science. Focusing interventions in these areas may lead to an increase in the number of students pursuing engineering.",Tan L.; Main J.; Darolia R.,Journal,Journal of Engineering Education,2021-07-01,University of Kentucky;Purdue University,analytics ;  diversity ;  engineering major choice ;  engineering pathways ;  high school ;  quantitative
3D Printing for Cardiovascular Applications: From End-to-End Processes to Emerging Developments,"3D printing as a means of fabrication has seen increasing applications in medicine in the last decade, becoming invaluable for cardiovascular applications. This rapidly developing technology has had a significant impact on cardiovascular research, its clinical translation and education. It has expanded our understanding of the cardiovascular system resulting in better devices, tools and consequently improved patient outcomes. This review discusses the latest developments and future directions of generating medical replicas (‘phantoms’) for use in the cardiovascular field, detailing the end-to-end process from medical imaging to capture structures of interest, to production and use of 3D printed models. We provide comparisons of available imaging modalities and overview of segmentation and post-processing techniques to process images for printing, detailed exploration of latest 3D printing methods and materials, and a comprehensive, up-to-date review of milestone applications and their impact within the cardiovascular domain across research, clinical use and education. We then provide an in-depth exploration of future technologies and innovations around these methods, capturing opportunities and emerging directions across increasingly realistic representations, bioprinting and tissue engineering, and complementary virtual and mixed reality solutions. The next generation of 3D printing techniques allow patient-specific models that are increasingly realistic, replicating properties, anatomy and function.",Gharleghi R.; Dessalles C.; Lal R.; McCraith S.; Sarathy K.; Jepson N.; Otton J.; Barakat A.; Beier S.,Journal,Annals of Biomedical Engineering,2021-07-01,UNSW Sydney;École Polytechnique;UNSW Medicine;Prince of Wales Hospital;Liverpool Hospital,Additive manufacturing ;  Bioprinting ;  Medical technology ;  Rapid prototyping ;  Tissue engineering ;  Virtual reality
Thermal control effects and mechanism of slag and fly ash on heat development of cement slurry used in hydrate formation,"Based on the requirements of low hydration heat and temperature rise of cement slurry used in deep-water gas hydrate formation, the thermal control effects of slag and fly ash on heat development of cement slurry were quantitatively and qualitatively investigated. The results show that the temperature rise, hydration heat and heat release rate of cement slurry were successfully reduced by slag and fly ash, which is beneficial to the cementing of gas hydrate formation, the engineering accidents, such as enlarged diameter, were avoided. Compared with pure cement slurry, the temperature rise of sample PCF37.5% and PCS37.5% was reduced by 16.5 and 12.1 °C, respectively. The hydration heat of sample PCF37.5% and PCS37.5% at 48 h was reduced by 35.3 and 16.3%, respectively. Secondly, the thermal control mechanisms of slag and fly ash on heat development of cement slurry were studied by X-ray Diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscope and Low Field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Testing. As a result, the quantitative analysis shows that the heat development of cement slurry was controlled firstly by the lower hydration heat characteristics of slag and fly ash. The hydration heat of slag and fly ash at 48 h is 28.153–47.067 J/g and 2.0549–4.765 J/g, respectively. Besides, the qualitative analysis of hydration process and products shows that the heat development was also controlled by delay effect of slag and fly ash. Compared with pure cement slurry, the hydration products of sample PCF50.0% and PCS50.0% were obviously reduced. The innovation of this study is that the fly ash and slag were used to control the heat development of cement slurry used in hydrate formation. Especially, the control mechanisms were obtained quantitative calculation and qualitative analysis. Furthermore, the research results could provide technical reference for the design of cement slurry for hydrate formation cementing.",Huo J.; Yu B.; Peng Z.; Wu Z.; Zhang L.,Journal,Journal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering,2021-07-01,Xi'an Polytechnic University;Southwest Petroleum University China,Cement slurry ;  Heat development ;  Mechanical properties ;  Slag and fly ash ;  Thermal control effects ;  Thermal control mechanisms

Constructivist teaching and learning with technologies in the COVID-19 lockdown in Eastern India,"This paper reports a study on teaching and learning strategies during the COVID-19 lockdown period (CLP) that were used by the secondary government school teachers and students in Eastern India. These teaching and learning strategies were analysed in relation to their engagement with an initiative called Integrated approach to Technology in Education (ITE). ITE engagement in the pre-CLP involved using project-based learning (PBL) with technology and continuous, practise-based professional development for teachers focusing on integrating constructivist use of technology in their curriculum and pedagogy. A survey and interviews of teachers revealed that teachers with higher ITE engagement in the pre-CLP were more likely to use PBL with technology during the CLP. Students' interviews indicated that this PBL involved deep research and technical skills that were also practised during the CLP using distance technologies. Thus, the study demonstrated adaptation of ITE innovation into a distance mode; the introduction of WebQuests during the CLP improved the likelihood of teachers engaging in project-based teaching and PBL during the CLP. Policymakers, practitioners and researchers are recommended to adopt and continue to study the sustainability of ITE approach in new contexts such as the CLP. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Project-based learning (PBL) with technology is related to constructivist use of technology which leads to higher order thinking skills and the learner's ability to adapt learning and knowledge in new contexts. Effective teacher professional development (TPD) is continuous, uses community of practise (CoP) groups and offers opportunities to practise new knowledge and skills in the classroom context. TPD for technology integration allows the demonstration and practise of constructivist pedagogies. Access to devices, connectivity and digital resources in the local language are major issues faced by students to connect with teaching and learning in the COVID-lockdown period (CLP), especially students in underprivileged settings. What this paper adds Prior exposure to PBL with technology and effective TPD when combined with demonstrations of this learning in a new context (COVID-19 lockdown period, CLP required distance mode) will increase the likelihood of implementing PBL with technology in this new context. Besides increased use of technology, the CLP created a scope for adoption of teaching and learning pedagogies in the post-CLP, such as the use of Instant Messaging Application (IMA) for a flipped classroom experience across home/social and school settings. Implications for practice and/or policy Standardised digital resources may not be the only solution for teaching and learning when schools have to be closed. Constructivist use of technology by students with project-based learning (PBL), artefact creation on authentic tasks and inquiry-based learning has the potential to transform students from passive consumers into active adapters in newer contexts like COVID-19 lockdown period (CLP). Investment in practise-based continuous professional development of teachers can develop a sense of agency and competence so that teachers can adapt technologies for constructive teaching pedagogies and mitigate access related challenges for students in different contexts. Integrate new teaching and learning strategies that emerged during the CLP in the curriculum and pedagogy of both in-service and pre-service teacher professional development.",Charania A.; Bakshani U.; Paltiwale S.; Kaur I.; Nasrin N.,Journal,British Journal of Educational Technology,2021-07-01,Tata Institute of Social Sciences,constructive teaching and learning with technology ;  distance education with PBL ;  teaching and learning in COVID-lockdown in Indian government schools ;  teaching and learning with technology in the COVID-19 lockdown period
"A fault detection method for FADS system based on interval-valued neutrosophic sets, belief rule base, and D-S evidence reasoning","Fault detection, with the characteristics of strong uncertainty and randomness, has always been one of the research hotspots in the field of aerospace. Considering that devices will inevitably encounter various unknown interference in the process of use, which greatly limits the performance of many traditional fault detection methods. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to address this problem from the perspective of uncertainty and randomness of measurement signal. In information engineering, interval-valued neutrosophic sets (IVNSs), belief rule base (BRB), and Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence reasoning are always characterized by the strong ability in revealing uncertainty, but each has its drawbacks. As a result, the three theories are firstly combined in this paper to form a powerful fault detection algorithm. Besides, a series of innovations are proposed to improve the method, including a new score function based on p-norm for IVNSs and a new approach of calculating the similarity between IVNSs, which are both proved by authoritative prerequisites. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, flush air data sensing (FADS), a technologically advanced airborne sensor, is adopted in this paper. The aerodynamic model of FADS is analyzed in detail using knowledge of aerodynamics under subsonic and supersonic conditions, meanwhile, the high-precision model is established based on the aerodynamic database obtained from CFD software. For further confirming the validity and feasibility, a comparison with the methods based on parity equation, χ2 distribution, and information fusion method ordered weighted averaging (OWA) with three sets of weight vectors are conducted.",Jia Q.; Hu J.; Zhang W.,Journal,Aerospace Science and Technology,2021-07-01,Northwestern Polytechnical University,Belief rule base (BRB) ;  Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence reasoning ;  Fault detection ;  Flush air data sensing (FADS) ;  Interval-valued neutrosophic sets (IVNSs)
Understanding and improving artifact sharing in software engineering research,"In recent years, many software engineering researchers have begun to include artifacts alongside their research papers. Ideally, artifacts, including tools, benchmarks, and data, support the dissemination of ideas, provide evidence for research claims, and serve as a starting point for future research. However, in practice, artifacts suffer from a variety of issues that prevent the realization of their full potential. To help the software engineering community realize the full potential of artifacts, we seek to understand the challenges involved in the creation, sharing, and use of artifacts. To that end, we perform a mixed-methods study including a survey of artifacts in software engineering publications, and an online survey of 153 software engineering researchers. By analyzing the perspectives of artifact creators, users, and reviewers, we identify several high-level challenges that affect the quality of artifacts including mismatched expectations between these groups, and a lack of sufficient reward for both creators and reviewers. Using Diffusion of Innovations (DoI) as an analytical framework, we examine how these challenges relate to one another, and build an understanding of the factors that affect the sharing and success of artifacts. Finally, we make recommendations to improve the quality of artifacts based on our results and existing best practices.",Timperley C.; Herckis L.; Le Goues C.; Hilton M.,Journal,Empirical Software Engineering,2021-07-01,School of Computer Science;Carnegie Mellon University,Artifacts ;  Diffusion ;  Implementation science ;  Replicability ;  Replication ;  Reproducibility
"An exploration of how creativity, functionality, and aesthetics are related in design","Creativity is considered to have a significant impact on the design process and its outcomes, while aesthetics and functionality are considered key characteristics of products. A relationship between creativity, aesthetics and functionality is, therefore, often assumed, however, researchers view the relations between creativity, functionality and aesthetics differently. In this paper, the authors present first evidence that novelty, usefulness and surprise are the core elements of design creativity. The aim of this research is the exploration of the relations between functionality, aesthetics, novelty, usefulness, surprise, and overall creativity, by means of an experimental case study involving design experts evaluating forty-five design samples. Statistical analysis has been conducted to investigate and understand these relations. The results obtained indicate that aesthetics has a significant positive relationship with creativity but that functionality does not have a statistically significant relationship with creativity in general. Further analysis confirms that design creativity is strongly and positively related to novelty and surprise, but not significantly related to usefulness. In addition, high correlation coefficient values have revealed that creativity, novelty and surprise are perceived as the same dimension as are functionality and usefulness. This paper may be of interest to researchers, practitioners, and educators in the broader realm of design, including industrial design, creativity in design, engineering design, design innovation, product design and new product development. It provides new insights into how creativity is perceived within the field and offers a new point of view on creativity and its dimensions for the community to meditate and to debate.",Han J.; Forbes H.; Schaefer D.,Journal,Research in Engineering Design,2021-07-01,University of Liverpool,Aesthetics ;  Creativity ;  Functionality ;  Novelty ;  Surprise ;  Usefulness
A Note on Data-driven Actor-differentiation and SDGs 2 and 12: Insights from a Food-sharing App,"Using a dataset of 8,907 users of OLIO, a sharing-economy app designed to facilitate peer-to-peer food sharing and redistribution in response to UN SDGs 2 and 12, this study investigates the extent to which actor-differentiation between community volunteers and regular users is possible, and a useful means for quantifying the efficacy of volunteer-based community activation for start-ups. Specifically, we find that food-collection volunteers have substantially greater unique interactions and item listing volumes. We also find that volunteers have eight times more contact with other users and 17 times higher listing volumes. Volunteers also have conversations four times sooner after listing an item for sharing, and faster transaction rates. We conduct this research against a backdrop of increased interest in data-driven research in entrepreneurship and innovation and with reference to opportunities to advance the operationalization of SDGs via innovation mobilization.",Lucas B.; Francu R.; Goulding J.; Harvey J.; Nica-Avram G.; Perrat B.,Journal,Research Policy,2021-07-01,University of Nottingham,"Apps ;  Food-sharing ;  SDG 12 ;  SDG 2 ;  Sharing Economy ;  Start-ups, Volunteering"
Distilling and renewing science team search through external engagement,"To navigate the uncertainty inherent in science driven innovation, academic science teams must often undertake search through engagement with external actors. While both broad and narrow external engagement are beneficial to team search during innovation, it remains unclear how science teams coordinate and utilise engagement across time. To address this issue, we tracked the search activity of a publicly funded medical technology team in New Zealand over five and a half years. Our inductive analysis leads to a grounded theory process model showing how academic science teams manage their search activities during innovation across three stages of external engagement: devising and coordinating, assimilating, and distilling. Our study makes three contributions. First, we show that science team search progresses from broad engagement with clinicians, patients, and industry to narrow and stronger engagement between a select set of within team and external actors from these communities at later stages of the innovation process. Second, our research shows how science teams renew their search activities during innovation. As engagements around original project objectives are distilled to fewer and stronger engagements, other team resources are released and redeployed to pursue more exploratory avenues of research in tandem, thereby re-instating broader and more distant search within the team's innovation activities. Third, we introduce to the literature and detail two transition points (i.e., brokering and control) through which science team search is distilled. We discuss the implications of our findings for research policy and practice.",O'Kane C.; Haar J.; Mangematin V.; Daellenbach U.; Davenport S.,Journal,Research Policy,2021-07-01,Otago Business School;KEDGE Business School;Auckland University of Technology;Victoria University of Wellington,Exploration ;  External engagement ;  Innovation network ;  Science teams ;  Search
"Advanced manufacturing technology adoption and innovation: A systematic literature review on barriers, enablers, and innovation types","This study examines the barriers and enablers within the adoption process of advanced manufacturing technologies (AMTs) and their relationship to different innovation types as outcomes of this process. Whilst the requirement to improve AMT adoption is widely acknowledged, the existing literature lacks a comprehensive understanding of the main barriers and enablers within the adoption process. Furthermore, it does not reveal how these barriers and enablers are related to different innovation types. We provide a systematic literature review of the barriers and enablers to AMT adoption. The findings of this review are based on a total of eighty-seven peer-reviewed articles from the business and management literature from 1999-2019. Our findings provide several contributions to the literature. Firstly, by integrating evidence from empirical studies, we identify five main types of barriers and four main types of enablers to adoption. Secondly, we conceptualise three key stages of the AMT adoption process and classify the barriers and enablers on the basis of whether they apply to an individual stage, or whether their influence is pertinent across the whole process. Thirdly, we reveal the relationship between categories of barriers and enablers associated to innovation types outcomes: product, process, service or business model innovations. The results of our study provide important implications for both managers and policy makers based on the evidence of the key barriers and enablers. Further, we suggest several directions for future research, including the need to examine the post-installation stage.",Stornelli A.; Ozcan S.; Simms C.,Journal,Research Policy,2021-07-01,University of Portsmouth;Bahçeşehir Üniversitesi;HSE University,adoption process ;  advanced manufacturing ;  barriers and enablers ;  Industry 4.0 ;  innovation types ;  technological adoption
Review of fiber optic sensors for corrosion monitoring in reinforced concrete,"Monitoring corrosion in reinforced concrete is critical to assess the health condition of structures at an early stage and enable effective and efficient asset management. Various novel fiber optic sensors have been developed and demonstrated many advantages in monitoring corrosion in reinforced concrete under different conditions. However, currently, there is a gap between sensor technology innovation and engineering practices, and the gap hinders further development and wide applications of fiber optic sensors. This paper reviews representative types of fiber optic sensors for monitoring corrosion in reinforced concrete. The reviewed types of sensors include grating sensors, interferometer sensors, distributed sensors, and reflectometer sensors. For each type of sensors, the reviewed contents include the sensing principle and key features of applications, such as sensor design and installation, sensitivity, resolution, and sensor life. Emphasis is placed on discussing the functions and performance of the sensors in different corrosion stages. Based on the review, technical challenges and future research needs are identified and discussed. This review is expected to advance sensor development and promote effective applications of fiber optic sensors for intelligent structures and asset management.",Fan L.; Bao Y.,Journal,Cement and Concrete Composites,2021-07-01,"Voiland College of Engineering and Architecture;Charles V.

"Intersection of Diversity, Out-of-Class Engagement, and Engineer of 2020 Outcomes for Civil Engineering Students","The accelerating pace of technological innovation, coupled with social, cultural, political, and economic forces, have rapidly transformed the practice of engineering with unique implications for civil engineers in 2020 and beyond. Envisioning this momentum, the National Academy of Engineering in 2004 proposed ten key attributes that engineers by the year 2020 must possess to embrace the transformations. Although previous research found engineering undergraduates accruing The Engineer of 2020 (E2020) attributes from various pathways, including learning activities taking place outside of the college classroom, fewer studies have examined disciplinary outcomes and underrepresented populations. This paper explores how civil engineering undergraduates accrued E2020 attributes from out-of-class activities and examined the findings through the lens of diversity by disaggregating by gender, race/ethnicity, first-generation college status, disability status, and sexual orientation. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze a sample of 320 US civil engineering undergraduates who are graduating in the year 2020 and beyond. The results indicated that students from underrepresented groups (female; African American, Hispanic, American Indian, and multiracial; and first-generation college) indicated stronger agreement that they accrued E2020 attributes in out-of-class activities than students from overrepresented groups (male; White and Asian; and continuing generation in college). Students in overrepresented populations accrued most outcomes from their participation in jobs and sports. In addition to jobs, female and first-generation college students indicated that the design competition team was the setting in which they perceived the most outcomes. Professional experience and music/dance were frequently cited as impactful by subsamples of African American, Hispanic, American Indian, multiracial, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ)+ students, respectively. The results highlight the importance of out-of-class activities for undergraduates in civil engineering, especially for students belonging to underrepresented populations. This paper contributes to workforce diversity by illuminating learning pathways and outcomes that can broaden the quantity and quality of future civil engineers.",Polmear M.; Chau A.; Simmons D.,Journal,Journal of Management in Engineering,2021-07-01,Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering,Civil engineering students ;  Co-curricular ;  Diversity ;  Extracurricular ;  Gender ;  Out-of-class activities ;  The Engineer of 2020 attributes ;  Underrepresented
Reconfigurability of the origami-inspired integrated 8R kinematotropic metamorphic mechanism and its evolved 6R and 4R mechanisms,"Origami engineering as an interdisciplinary subject brings thriving progress of mechanisms innovation. In this paper, a construction approach from origami to multiple spherical-integrated mechanisms is proposed and subtly sets up the bridge between origami and Bennett linkage, Bricard linkage. Subsequently, the attention is drawn to a special origami-inspired integrated 8R kinematotropic metamorphic mechanism. The paper applies screw theory to illustrating the reconfigurability of singular configurations with distinct parametric constraints in the 8R mechanism. Two overconstrained linkages, a 4R linkage and a 6R linkage, are evolved under peculiar geometrical constraints respectively. Furthermore, the kaleidocycle and deployable properties of the 8R mechanism are revealed. The paper hence not only presents an interesting work extracted from origami but also sheds light on the promising investigation about the intersection of distinct types of reconfigurable mechanisms. Finally, by using the kinematotropic metamorphic 8R mechanism as the reconfigurable trunk, a novel quadruped robot is built and its characteristics will be investigated in future research.",Wang R.; Song Y.; Dai J.,Journal,Mechanism and Machine Theory,2021-07-01,Tianjin University;Fuzhou University;King's College London,Kinematotropic metamorphic mechanism ;  Origami engineering ;  Overconstrained linkage ;  Reconfigurability ;  Screw theory

Efficiency assessment of green technology innovation of renewable energy enterprises in China: a dynamic data envelopment analysis considering undesirable output,"The rapid development of renewable energy enterprises has produced important benefits for contemporary efforts to address serious environmental pollution and depletion of fossil energy resources. However, the environmental pollution that exists in the production and operation of enterprises has been ignored, and so an objective evaluation of this issue is becoming urgent. This paper established an evaluation index system for green technology innovation efficiency and used dynamic data envelopment analysis (DEA) considering undesirable output to measure the green technology innovation efficiency of renewable energy enterprises, and the improvement potential of ineffective enterprises was put forward. The results show that: (1) the green technology innovation of renewable energy enterprises needs to be greatly improved. The average efficiency score of sample was 0.385 over four years, and only 16 enterprises were found to operate effectively; (2) when effective and inefficient DMUs were compared, the latter were found to have significant output shortfalls, especially in environmental tax, and were found to show an improvement potential of 55.71 percent; (3) the efficiency analysis of different types of renewable energy enterprises found that the green technology innovation efficiency score of nuclear energy enterprises was the highest, and rapidly rose; (4) the green technology innovation efficiency of renewable energy enterprises in the western region greatly exceeded the efficiency of the eastern and central regions. The efficiency evaluation results could not only provide a guidance for central and local governances to optimize the structure of renewable energy sector, but also potentially provide a reference for the operation and management of renewable energy enterprises in China.

"Eco-efficiency, eco-technology innovation and eco-well-being performance to improve global sustainable development","In today's world, determining how to improve the quality of the economy, technology innovation and human well-being within resource and environmental limits is a global sustainable development goal. Thus, research on eco-efficiency (EE), eco-technology innovation (ETI) and eco-well-being performance (EWP) has great significance for improving the efficiency of converting ecological consumption into economic benefits, technological innovation and human well-being. This paper presents a two-stage Super-slack-based measure (SBM) model to examine the EE, ETI and EWP (3E) of 102 countries. The indicator system for the 3E network process is constructed by using inputs, intermediate products and outputs. The empirical results show that the highest 3E performers are Singapore, the United States and Iceland. The results also indicate that countries with high levels of economic development have much better EE, ETI and EWP levels than low-income countries. After comparing the values of the 3E in different countries with the global average, the results further show that overall global 3E performance is relatively low. These findings provide significant references to help governments generate different strategies for improving national 3E performance.",Zhang Y.; Mao Y.; Jiao L.; Shuai C.; Zhang H.,Journal,Environmental Impact Assessment Review,2021-07-01,"Chongqing College of Electronic Engineering;University of Michigan, Ann Arbor;Chongqing Jiaotong University",Eco-efficiency ;  Eco-technology innovation ;  Eco-well-being performance ;  Sustainable development
Mechanism Configuration and Innovation Control System Design for Power Cable Line Mobile Maintenance Robot,"High-voltage power cables are important channels for power transmission systems. Their special geographical environment and harsh natural environment can lead to many different faults. At present, such special operations in dangerous and harsh environments are performed manually, which not only has high labor intensity and low work efficiency but also has great personal safety risks. In order to solve such difficult problems, this paper studies the power maintenance robot for insulator string replacement, spacer replacement, damper and drainage plate maintenance; the basic configuration and the operation motion planning have been proposed; and the virtual prototype of the inspection maintenance robots has been developed, and then the mechanical structure of the robots has been optimized by the robot kinematics modeling and analyzed the working space based on the Monte Carlo method. The system platform, operation function, structural characteristics and related key technologies involved in the robot system development were systematically summarized; the deep integration point for the robot technology with big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and ubiquitous power Internet-of-Things technologies was also discussed.

Sprouting “sustainability” in chemical sciences curriculum,"The purpose of this paper is to present a new viewpoint on how the curricula for higher education chemistry courses can be restructured, so that students understand the various dimensions of the sustainability concept and are equipped to work chemical sciences in a profitable, clean and societal friendly way, that is synthesis of materials (which collates CHNOPS—atomic symbols) in desired architecture and disperse them after their intended use, back into their natural reservoirs. A very novel idea of “sustainable chemical science facility”, encompassing a teaching module capable of imparting strong fundamental Chemistry concepts, a virtual environment for undergoing the basic industrial training and a production unit with modular reactors for resource funding is proposed here. Often research is restricted to academic qualification, and a substantial band gap exists between the microscopic realm of academic research and the macroscopic domain of industrial chemistry, which thrives on research application. This band gap can be overcome by arming young chemists with training, tools and experience to possess complete control (synthetic and functional) on the materials they produce. The conceptual facility if turned into reality will definitely be the right step towards achieving materials with sustainable functionalities. We will have learning, training and production under one roof. Students will receive theoretical, practical and real-life experience of the production in industries, making them efficiently employable at a very young age. The idea is to bridge some critical engineering concepts with core chemistry, but with a clear distinction between chemical reactor engineering and core chemistry. This paper is a brainchild of the author and is more of a policy paper, needed to be elaborately discussed in academic and industrial forums.",Ganarajan S.; Ashok K.,Journal,"Environment, Development and Sustainability",2021-07-01,"Amrita School of Engineering, Coimbatore;Sprouts Montessori House of Children",Chemical science ;  Curriculum ;  Green chemistry ;  Innovation ;  Sustainable ;  Systems thinking
Business models in process industries: Emerging trends and future research,"This article reviews the literature on business models in process industries. The review reveals that the business model concept has gained an increasing amount of attention in process-industrial research, but it also shows that the literature exhibits a lack of construct clarity and that it is developing in different domains, depending on the perspectives scholars have taken to study business models in process industries. Specifically, while innovation management scholars have explored the relationship between technological innovations and business models as well as the process and outcomes of business model innovation, scholars from the domain of production management have focused on value chain (re)configurations and taken a system-based perspective to consider boundary-spanning exchanges with key stakeholders in the design of business models. However, despite variance in the perspectives, the review further shows that works in these divergent domains point to a family of emerging themes and to common ideas that have not been explored together. This allows us to identify the particularities of business models in process industries and develop a definition of process-industrial business models, which extends prior business model literature into the process industry context. Furthermore, we synthesize these connections to develop an agenda for future, cross-disciplinary research on business models in process industries that assists cumulative theorizing and subsequent empirical progress.",von Delft S.; Zhao Y.,Journal,Technovation,2021-07-01,Loughborough University London;Adam Smith Business School;University of Münster,Business model ;  Business model innovation ;  Innovation management ;  Literature review ;  Process industries ;  Production management
Automatically detect and classify asphalt pavement raveling severity using 3D technology and machine learning,"Raveling is one of the most common asphalt pavement distresses that occur on US highway pavements. Raveling results in safety concerns such as loose stones and hydroplaning; poor ride quality and road/tire noise; and shortened pavement longevity. Traditional raveling survey methods involve manual visual inspection, which is time consuming, subjective, and hazardous to highway workers. With the research project competitively selected and sponsored by the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Innovation Deserving Exploratory Analysis (IDEA) program, the objective of this study is to develop an accurate raveling detection and classification algorithm using 3D pavement data that has become mainstream technologies for state Department of Transportations (DOTs) in the US for pavement condition evaluation, and to comprehensively validate these methods using large-scale, real-world data based on actual transportation agencies’ distress protocol (Severity levels 1, 2, and 3). A total of 65 miles of 3 D pavement data was collected on I-85 and I-285 in Georgia for training and testing. Three supervised machine learning techniques —AdaBoost with decision trees, support vector machine (SVM) and random forests—were developed for the detection and classification of raveling in the collected data. The random forest classifier had the b est performance, with precision values ranging from 75.6% for level 3 raveling to 97.6% for level 0 (no) raveling and recall values ranging from 86.9% for level 1 raveling to 96.1% for level 0 raveling on real world large-scale data. The developed raveling detection and severity level classification method has been successfully implemented to entire Georgia’s interstate highway system with1452.5 survey miles of asphalt pavements after the large-scale validation and refinement. The proposed method for raveling detection can be deployed to other transportation agencies for safer and more efficient assessment of roadway raveling conditions.",Tsai Y.; Zhao Y.; Pop-Stefanov B.; Chatterjee A.,Journal,International Journal of Pavement Research and Technology,2021-07-01,Georgia Institute of Technology,Decision trees ;  Machine learning ;  Random forest ;  Raveling ;  Road condition assessment ;  SVM

Educational Landscapes during and after COVID-19,"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has forced an unprecedented global shift within higher education in the ways that we communicate with and educate students. This necessary paradigm shift has compelled educators to take a critical look at their teaching styles and use of technology. Computing education traditionally focuses on experiential, in-person activities. The pandemic has mandated that educators reconsider their use of student time and has catalysed overnight innovations in the educational setting. Even in the unlikely event that we return entirely to pre-COVID-19 norms, many new practices have emerged that offer valuable lessons to be carried forward into our post-COVID-19 teaching. This working group will explore what the post-COVID-19 academic landscape might look like, and how we can use lessons learned during this educational shift to improve our subsequent practice. The exploration will strive to identify practices within computing that appear to have been improved through exposure to online tools and technologies, and that should therefore continue to be used in the online space. In the broadest sense, our motivation is to explore what the post-COVID-19 educational landscape will look like for computing education.",Siegel A.; Zarb M.; Alshaigy B.; Blanchard J.; Crick T.; Glassey R.; Hott J.; Latulipe C.; Riedesel C.; Senapathi M.; Simon.; Williams D.,Conference Proceeding,"Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, ITiCSE",2021-06-26,"University of Nebraska–Lincoln;Auckland University of Technology;University of Virginia;Dalhousie University;University of Aberdeen;University of Florida;Robert Gordon University;The University of Newcastle, Australia;University of Manitoba;Dublin Business School;Swansea University;The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)",computing education ;  coronavirus ;  COVID-19 ;  online education

Increasing the robustness and crack resistivity of high-performance carbon fiber composites for space applications,"The endeavors to develop manufacturing methods that can enhance polymer and composite structures in spacecraft have led to much research and innovation over many decades. However, the thermal stability, intrinsic material stress, and anisotropic substrate properties pose significant challenges and inhibit the use of previously proposed solutions under extreme space environment. Here, we overcome these issues by developing a custom-designed, plasma-enhanced cross-linked poly(p-xylylene):diamond-like carbon superlattice material that enables enhanced mechanical coupling with the soft polymeric and composite materials, which in turn can be applied to large 3D engineering structures. The superlattice structure developed forms an integral part with the substrate and results in a space qualifiable carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer featuring 10–20 times greater resistance to cracking without affecting the stiffness of dimensionally stable structures. This innovation paves the way for the next generation of advanced ultra-stable composites for upcoming optical and radar instrument space programs and advanced engineering applications.",Delkowski M.; Smith C.; Anguita J.; Silva S.,Journal,iScience,2021-06-25,Airbus Defence and Space;University of Surrey,Aerospace engineering ;  engineering materials ;  materials physics
Retrospect and perspective of the estuarine turbidity maximum zone researches,"Turbidity maximum zone (TMZ) is the dynamic turbid water areas within limits in an estuary, where the concentrations of total suspended solids (TSS) are steadily and significantly higher than in the upstream river and the downstream sea. TMZ is a special phenomenon of the process of suspended sediment movement and transport in estuaries, which reflects the interaction of particulate matter and turbulent energy between rivers and oceans. TMZ has long been a hot topic for scientific inquiries and engineering innovations among a broad spectrum of scholars, government agencies, engineering corporations, and communities. The studies of TMZ has a long history of over 80 years since it was proposed in the last century. Based on a comprehensive review, the paper summarizes the main findings and progress of the TMZ studies and provides prospects of TMZ research in the future. The previous studies have focused on the basic characteristics of TMZ systematically and comprehensively, such as the TSS concentrations, and the sources and compositions TSS in estuaries. Although the formation and development of TMZ are affected by various factors and rather complex, estuarine gravitational circulation and tidal effects are considered as the primary mechanisms of TMZ formation and the main control factors of TMZ in different types of estuaries, including weakly, partially, or well-mixed estuaries. Besides, sediment re-suspension also plays an important role in TMZ formation. Additionally, dynamic evolution characteristics of TMZ from short to medium terms have been analyzed and discussed in great detail. It has been commonly agreed that these past and current studies of TMZ have made great progress in many aspects, and the findings and outcomes have made significant contributions to our theoretical understanding and practical management of TMZ. However, several areas warrant further exploration to advance the TMZ research, to improve our understanding of the spatial and temporal variations of TMZ, and to contribute to the sustainable management of TMZ for improving its surrounding natural eco-environment. The first one is to accurately detect, extract, and measure the size, depth, and volume of TMZ in estuaries. Where a TMZ is located in an estuary is a fundamental question and an important task for studying TMZ. However, current studies of detecting TMZ were mainly based on relatively rough description or some types of thresholds of TSS concentrations, or certain levels of turbidity criteria, which had low accuracies, were not consistent in different estuaries and times and showed weak applicability. Therefore, future works should focus more on the exploration of new methods and techniques for precisely detecting and extracting the spatiotemporal distributions of TMZ. Secondly, to comprehensively understand the whole features of TMZ, detection, and measurement of 3D distribution characteristics of TMZ in different conditions should be rigorously carried out in the future. Last but not least, future studies should pay more attention to the studies of the long term impacts of human activities and global environmental changes on spatial and temporal variations of TMZ to obtain a more profound understanding of the change dynamics of TMZ for better management policies.",Wang C.; Zhou C.; Chen S.; Xie Y.; Li D.; Yang J.; Zhou X.; Li Y.; Wang D.; Liu Y.,Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2021-06-25,"Guangdong Academy of Sciences;Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory;Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences;Eastern Michigan University;Sun Yat-Sen University",Estuary ;  Formation mechanism ;  Spatial and temporal variation ;  Turbidity maximum zone
How does environmental information disclosure affect economic development and haze pollution in Chinese cities? The mediating role of green technology innovation,"To achieve the win-win goal of fostering economic development and inhibiting haze pollution in China, environmental information disclosure has been given more and more attention for its role of promoting green technology innovation. Utilizing a panel data of 113 prefecture and above cities from 2008 to 2018, this thesis first provides an empirical evidence for the strategic interaction of environmental information disclosure in China, verifies the coexistence of “race to the bottom” and “race to the top”, and finds that the intensity of “race to the bottom” is stronger than that of “race to the top”. Then, this thesis employs an empirical analysis on the mediating role of green technology innovation between environmental information disclosure and economic development and haze pollution from the perspective of static, dynamic, and even dynamic spatial perspectives. The results show that green technology innovation partly mediates the promotion effect of environmental information disclosure on economic development and the inhibition effect of environmental information disclosure on haze pollution under the static situation. In addition, green technology innovation fully mediates the promotion effect of environmental information disclosure on economic development but partly mediates the inhibition effect of environmental information disclosure on haze pollution under the dynamic situation. Furthermore, with the consideration of dynamic and spatial spillover effects of dependent variables such as economic development and haze pollution simultaneously, the mediation roles of green technology innovation between environmental information disclosure and economic development and haze pollution are both not supported, while the inhibition effect of green technology innovation on haze pollution is still established. The results not only identify the strategic interaction of environmental information disclosure and reveal the effectiveness of the mediating role of green technology innovation between environmental information disclosure and economic development and environmental pollution under the static and dynamic situations, but also provide a theoretical framework for green, sustainable, and high-quality development in China.",Feng Y.; Wang X.; Liang Z.,Journal,Science of the Total Environment,2021-06-25,Harbin Institute of Technology,Economic development ;  Environmental information disclosure ;  Green technology innovation ;  Haze pollution ;  Strategic interaction

Analytics mistakes that derail software startups,"[Context] Software startups are engines of innovation and economy, yet building software startups is challenging and subject to a high failure rate. They need to act and respond fast in highly uncertain business environments. To do so, they need to identify crucial and actionable information that supports them in making correct decisions and reduce uncertainty. So far, the software startup literature focused predominantly on what information to measure from a metrics perspective. Thus, there is a lack of research investigating how to deal with information from an analytics perspective. [Objective] The current study aims at understanding how software startups are dealing with crucial information that could lead to meaningful actions. The overall research question that guides the study is: what analytics mistakes do software startups make? [Method] We investigated 22 failed software startups using their post-mortem reports as the main source. They were included in the study because the founding teams made mistakes related to information and analytics, which contributed to their startup failure to various degrees. We analyzed the collected data using thematic analysis. [Results] Ten types of mistakes made by the 22 failed startups when dealing with information are identified. These ten types are further grouped into four categories from an analytics process perspective, including information collection, information analysis, information communication, and information usage. [Conclusions] Our findings contribute to a better understanding of how software startups are dealing with information. It provides an opportunity for software startup teams to learn from the recurring mistakes of failed startups. Interesting future research avenues include defining patterns and antipatterns in software startup analytics by studying both failed and successful startups and doing an in-depth investigation of essential metrics for software startups.",Rafiq U.; Melegati J.; Khanna D.; Guerra E.; Wang X.,Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2021-06-21,Free University of Bozen-Bolzano,Analytics mistakes ;  Information dealing mistakes ;  Software startups ;  Startup analytics

Research on the construction mechanism of science and innovation corridor from the perspective of innovation chain,"Based on the perspective of innovation chain, this paper takes Highway 128 and Guang-Shen Science and Technology Innovation Corridor as examples to explore the construction mechanism of science and technology innovation corridor. The findings are as follows: First, the corridor can be regarded as a virtual organization containing core nodes and auxiliary nodes. All nodes are not equal, and the core node plays the core function. Second, if the function of the core node is weakened, the science and innovation corridor will show a deterioration trend. Third, the construction of the science and innovation corridor is a process of the whole science and innovation chain from the flow and integration of knowledge resources, to the overflow of innovation incubation, and then to the market application. However, there are still problems in the chain, such as resource flow obstacles, innovation incubation breaks and structural imbalance. Therefore, in order to realize the benign interaction of multiple subjects in the science and innovation corridor, there needs to be a core subject that plays the role of agglomeration and diffusion, so as to realize the coordinated development of the corridor.",Li J.; Han Y.; Liu S.,Conference Proceeding,E3S Web of Conferences,2021-06-21,Zhejiang Gongshang University,

So the authors of the article are: Authors: Martina Sciomentaa, Luca Speraa, Chiara Bedonb, Vincenzo Rinaldia, Michela Nocettic, Michele Brunettic, Massimo Fragiacomoa, Manuela Romagnolid aDepartment of Civil, Architecture and Building and Environmental Engineering, University of L'Aquila, Via Giovanni Gronchi 18, 67100 L'Aquila, Italy bDepartment of Engineering and Architecture, University of Trieste, Via Alfonso Valerio, 6/1, 34127 Trieste, Italy cCNR-IBE, Institute of BioEconomy, Via Madonna del Piano 10, 50019 Sesto Fiorentino, FI, Italy dDepartment of Innovation of Biological, Food and Forestry Systems (DIBAF), University of Tuscia, Via S. Camillo de Lellis, 01100 Viterbo, Italy Moreover, the authors regret that some parts of the paragraph 2.1 need small revisions and it should be replaced with the text below. The three-layered CLT panels object of study were produced by using softwood: Corsican pine (Pinus nigra subsp. laricio) and hardwood: beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) originated from a Southern Italy (Calabria) forest. Raw material was cut into boards having a nominal section of 120 mm width and 20 mm thick. Beech boards had an average length of 3.10 m while the Corsican pine ones of 4.00 m. A batch of 597 beech and 220 Corsican pine boards was collected and kiln-dried to a moisture content of 10%, in order to satisfy the manufacturers requirement for gluing process. The boards were strength graded according to EN 14081-2 rules [14] by the grading machine ViSCAN-Portable (MiCROTEC). Each board was first weighted and measured to determine its density ρ. Then, the natural frequency of vibration f1 induced by a percussion was measured by using a laser interferometer. The dynamic modulus of elasticity E0,dyn was thus calculated as: [Figure presented] where ρ is the density of the board, l is the length and f1 is the frequency. The machine settings used for the strength grading of the boards of both beech and pine were developed in previous studies [11],[15]. The strength class combinations used to qualify the raw material were D40 and rejects for beech and C20 and rejects for pine (EN 338 [16]). The 95% of beech boards was classified as D40, while 5% of the samples was discarded because of defects (presence of fiber deviations and not uniform planing). In the case of Corsican pine boards, the 73% of them was graded as C20, while the remaining 27% was rejected. A total amount of 365 beech boards and 90 Corsican pine boards was hence used for manufacturing a series of CLT panels. Regression analysis was performed based on destructive tests carried out on beech and pine raw material for the machine setting development [11],[15]. Linear regression were used for the estimation of the Modulus of Rupture (MOR), as well as the global and local Modulus of Elasticity (MOEglobal and MOElocal respectively) from the dynamic modulus of elasticity measured during machine grading. The mean properties obtained by the grading procedure and the evaluated MOR and MOEs are summarized in Table 1. For the research study herein discussed, two different types of adhesives were used, namely a melamine Urea Formaldheyde (MUF) adhesive (GripProTM Design – AkzoNobel, that was obtained by mixing a two component hardner (H002) and a liquid flexible resin (A002)), and a one-component Polyurethane adhesive (Loctite ® HBS 049-Purbond). The choice of employing the melamine adhesive was due to the usage of beech hardwood boards in panel's homogeneous and hybrid configurations with Corsican pine's boards.

When machine learning meets congestion control: A survey and comparison,"Machine learning has seen a significant surge and uptake across many diverse applications. The high flexibility, adaptability, and computing capabilities it provides extend traditional approaches used in multiple fields including network operation and management. Numerous surveys have explored machine learning algorithms in the context of networking, such as traffic engineering, performance optimization, and network security. Many machine learning approaches focus on clustering, classification, regression, and reinforcement learning. The innovation of this research, and the contribution of this paper lies in the detailed summary and comparison of learning-based congestion control approaches. Compared with traditional congestion control algorithms which are typically rule-based, capabilities to learn from historical experience are highly desirable. From the literature, it is observed that reinforcement learning is a crucial trend among learning-based congestion control algorithms. In this paper, we explore the performance of reinforcement learning-based congestion control algorithms and present current problems with reinforcement learning-based congestion control algorithms.

API Continuous Cooling and Antisolvent Crystallization for Kinetic Impurity Rejection in cGMP Manufacturing,"Crystallization of 204 kg of final active pharmaceutical ingredient was accomplished continuously using a cascade of mixed suspension mixed product removal crystallizers in cGMP manufacturing. This article describes the journey taken to transform a set of technical to final batch crystallizations into a continuous, combined cooling and antisolvent crystallization using three stirred tank crystallizers in series. Conversion of the batch process to a continuous process was beneficial to kinetically purge a key impurity. The conversion also allowed for the direct integration of the crystallization process with upstream continuous chemistry sections. A robust control strategy was developed from early research scale all the way to cGMP manufacturing. The authors will share the tools, techniques, modeling, and equipment used and challenges overcome to ensure a safe and reliable manufacturing process. A new intermittent flow technique transferred hot solution from a continuous evaporator into the first crystallizer with no solids bearding at the end of the inlet tubing.

Review on imaging and data processing of visual sensing,"Recently, significant developments of visual sensing have been observed in imaging technology and data processing, thereby providing great opportunities to enhance our ability to perceive and recognize our real world. Therefore, investigations on visual sensing possess important theoretical value and are required for application needs. Surveying the progress to understand the trend in the field of visual sensing and to clarify the future research direction is beneficial. The reviews are generated mainly based on analyzing peer-reviewed academic publications and related reports. A general description on the states of the art and trends about the visual sensing is provided, mainly including laser scanning, high dynamic range (HDR) imaging, polarization imaging, and ocean acoustic tomography. Specifically, for each of these imaging fields, parts discussed include new hardware, processing technology, and application scenarios. Processing of 3D point cloud data has become more effective along with the great progresses in deep learning and the advancement of hardware devices. Meanwhile, applications of 3D point cloud data are increasingly popular for diverse purposes. Over past several years, many domestic institutions and teams focused on developing algorithms for 3D point cloud data processing, such as in feature extraction, semantic labeling and segmentation, and object detection. In particular, several teams have conducted a number of substantive work in the production and sharing of standard data sets, which promote and improve the processing ability and application level of point cloud data. However, at present, the commercial hardware still has some deficiencies. Combining 3D point cloud data with observation from other sensors is a valuable but challenging task. Nevertheless, the laser scanning system is expected to be widely used in transportation, civil engineering, forestry, agriculture, and other civil fields in the future to satisfy different detection and modeling tasks. At the same time, with ongoing advancements in laser scanning equipment, it also plays an important role in understanding natural sciences, such as archaeology and geoscience. High dynamic range imaging is a hot research field in digital image acquisition, processing, display, and applications. Currently, researchers mostly focus on multiple exposure, different modulation methods, and multi detector methods in the HDR imaging. For example, through nonlinear response and multiple exposure imaging, the dynamic range can reach approximately 140 dB, and it can reach approximately 160 dB by using multi detector imaging. Using deep learning directly in HDR image mapping, instead of using traditional methodology, such as optical flow method and the combination of optical flow and neural network, has become a distinguished characteristic. Deep learning neural network has also been gradually applied to single exposure HDR reconstruction and tone mapping. Many domestic research teams have investigated the issues for the combination of deep learning neural network and HDR imaging. As expected, advancements in deep neural network provide a good opportunity for processing HDR imaging, such as in image fusion. With potential advancements in new detector materials, detector design, semiconductor equipment, and technology towards nanotechnology, new detectors with 10 megapixel resolution and dynamic range better than 160 dB will be available and will greatly improve the sensitivity under low illumination. Important fields urgently need breakthrough, including HDR imaging of dynamic scene and acquisition, processing and display of color HDR imaging with large dynamics, and wide color gamut. Compared with the progresses in polarization imaging made by other countries (e.g., the United States of America, Canada, and Japan), the systematicness and practicability in DoFP CMOS chip research domestically still need to be improved. In practice, the domestic institutions have made continuous achievements in many polarization imaging issues, including mosaic removal, polarization defogging, underwater polarization, polarization 3D imaging, imaging polarization spectral remote sensing, airborne polarization imaging, marine environment spectral polarization imaging, and spatial polarization detection. Furthermore, integrated optical detection of land, sea, air, and space is a critical demand, which promotes the rapid development of polarization imaging and sensing. In multisource data fusion, many methods and technologies showed excellent performance in their respective applications correspondingly, including multidimensional data acquisition and intelligent processing of ""polarization +"", polarization + infrared, polarization + spectrum, polarization + TOF, polarization structured light, fluorescence polarization imaging (FPI), polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT), polarization-dependent optical second harmonic imaging, and polarization confocal microscopy imaging. In ocean acoustic tomography, institutions from the United States of America published the largest number of papers, showing distinguished trends from other countries. At the same time, as a country with the largest number of published patents, Japan shows great importance to ocean acoustic tomography and has certain advantages in technological innovation. Compared with institutions from the United States of America and Japan, institutions from China have published relatively a small number of papers and patents in ocean acoustic tomography. With more than 40 years of its development, great progresses were made in theory and technology. However, the application of ocean acoustic tomography still faces the bottleneck of high cost of sea trial, which is also impossibly used as an observation means alone. In conclusion, 1) the 3D modeling based on laser scanning still faces many challenges, although progresses have been made recently. With the development of hardware and progress in data processing, laser scanning system benefits many civil fields in the future to satisfy different detection and modeling tasks; 2) high dynamic range optical imaging technology has been gradually applied to many fields, mainly including infrared imaging, spectral imaging, polarization imaging, ultrasonic imaging, and single photon imaging, which are valuable for multidimensional information acquisition, intelligent processing, and data mining; 3) fully exploiting the potential of polarization imaging has great value. Furthermore, to achieve its better performance, the combination with other advanced imaging sensing technologies is necessary. 4) Marine acoustic tomography needs to be combined with other means to develop a low-cost, long-term observation network, which is based on distributed underwater sensor networks, satellite observations, submarine cables, as well as using artificial and natural noise as sound source of opportunity.",Wang C.; Chen F.; Wen D.; Lei H.; Song Z.; Zhao H.,Journal,Journal of Image and Graphics,2021-06-16,"College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University;Xiamen University of Technology;Xi'an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics Chinese Academy of Sciences;Xiamen University",High dynamic range imaging ;  Laser scanning ;  Ocean acoustic tomography ;  Polarization imaging ;  Visual sensing
Evolutionary game analysis of recycling management of waste power batteries of new energy vehicles,"Based on the evolutionary game theory, this paper constructs a game model between the government and power battery manufacturers with the aim of promoting the innovation of recycling technology to achieve sustainable development of energy and environment. The effects of penalties and subsidies on the behavior of power battery manufacturers in adopting green innovation technology strategies under unilateral and bilateral government policies are compared. Numerical simulations are used to verify the validity of the model and conclude that: penalties and subsidies can change the final choice of power battery manufacturers only when a certain threshold is exceeded; penalties can make power battery manufacturers adopt green innovation technology strategies more steadily than subsidies at an earlier stage when the green innovation technology surplus is negative; the number of recycling and the degree of technological innovation are also important factors affecting the evolutionary process of power battery manufacturers. Meanwhile, the above conclusions can provide some suggestions for the government to effectively manage the recycling of waste power batteries.",Wang C.; Liu J.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,2021-06-15,Shanghai Maritime University,

Current Status and Effective Suggestions for Efficient Exploitation of Coalbed Methane in China: A Review,"The commercial production of coalbed methane (CBM) in China has made significant achievements. To further improve the production of CBM and realize its development, it is necessary to establish a unique, high-efficiency CBM production method that considers the characteristics of coal reservoirs in China. This paper presents the current status of China's CBM exploitation over the past 15 years from three aspects: reservoir characteristics, production mode, and exploitation technology. The achievements, in terms of exploration and development of CBM resources in China, were summarized. The CBM reservoirs in China are characterized by high coal rank, low permeability, high gas content, and low reservoir pressure gradient. Strategic measures for coal and CBM co-mining were proposed creatively as ""Huainan"", ""Jincheng"", and ""Songzao""modes. CBM production enhancement measures have achieved significant innovations and breakthroughs in drilling and completion technologies and reservoir reconstruction, effectively reducing development costs and increasing single well production. Finally, based on existing basic research, this study proposes efficient CBM exploitation technologies suitable for the characteristics of CBM reservoirs in China. In particular, the uniform permeability enhancement measures of hydraulic grid slotting and fracturing have the advantages of safety, high efficiency, economy, feasibility, and broad application prospects under complex mining conditions. It is of great strategic significance to improve the CBM recovery rate and optimize China's energy structure.",Lu Y.; Zhang H.; Zhou Z.; Ge Z.; Chen C.; Hou Y.; Ye M.,Journal,Energy and Fuels,2021-06-03,Chongqing University,
Recent Advances in Immunosafety and Nanoinformatics of Two-Dimensional Materials Applied to Nano-imaging,"Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as an important class of nanomaterials for technological innovation due to their remarkable physicochemical properties, including sheet-like morphology and minimal thickness, high surface area, tuneable chemical composition, and surface functionalization. These materials are being proposed for new applications in energy, health, and the environment; these are all strategic society sectors toward sustainable development. Specifically, 2D materials for nano-imaging have shown exciting opportunities in in vitro and in vivo models, providing novel molecular imaging techniques such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, fluorescence and luminescence optical imaging and others. Therefore, given the growing interest in 2D materials, it is mandatory to evaluate their impact on the immune system in a broader sense, because it is responsible for detecting and eliminating foreign agents in living organisms. This mini-review presents an overview on the frontier of research involving 2D materials applications, nano-imaging and their immunosafety aspects. Finally, we highlight the importance of nanoinformatics approaches and computational modeling for a deeper understanding of the links between nanomaterial physicochemical properties and biological responses (immunotoxicity/biocompatibility) towards enabling immunosafety-by-design 2D materials.",Da Silva G.; Franqui L.; Petry R.; Maia M.; Fonseca L.; Fazzio A.; Alves O.; Martinez D.,Journal,Frontiers in Immunology,2021-06-03,Laboratório Nacional de Nanotecnologia;Universidade Estadual de Campinas;Universidade Federal do ABC,bioimaging ;  immunotoxicity ;  nanobiotechnology ;  nanomaterials ;  nanosafety
Sustainable waste management innovations in africa: New perspectives and research agenda for improving global health,"The need for green business practices and green innovations underscores a growing recognition that climate change is now an existential threat not just to population health but also to the survival of businesses that are unable to embrace green practices with a sense of urgency. This paper contributes to the literature on market violence as an inhibitor of green innovations for sustainable waste management to curb the unneeded health effects of wastes in Africa. Our purpose is to problematize received wisdom, unquestioned assumptions, and incorrect diagnosis of the sources and health consequences of various forms of wastes in Africa. Much of the discourse on this issue remains ahistorical, and that risks leaving aside a vital question of exploitative extraction. By including this ‘out‐of‐the‐box’ explanation through major case references, we are able to shed light on the critical issues that have hitherto received limited attention, thus enabling us to propose useful research questions for future enquiries. We propose a framework that delineates the structural composition of costs imposed by market violence that ranges from extraction to e‐waste disposal. We advocate for the engineering of policies that create conditions for doing more with less resources, eliminating waste, and recycling as crucial steps in creating sustainable waste management innovations. Additionally, we highlight a set of fundamental issues regarding enablers and inhibitors of sustainable innovations and policies for waste management worth considering for future research. These include programmed obsolescence, irresponsible extraction, production, and consumption, all seen through the theoretical lens of market violence.",Ahen F.; Amankwah‐amoah J.,Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2021-06-02,Kent Business School;Turun Kauppakorkeakoulu,Market violence ;  Planned obsolescence ;  Sustainability ;  Waste management innovations
Safe-by-design in engineering: An overview and comparative analysis of engineering disciplines,"In this paper, we provide an overview of how Safe-by-Design is conceived and applied in practice in a large number of engineering disciplines. We discuss the differences, commonalities, and possibilities for mutual learning found in those practices and identify several ways of putting those disciplinary outlooks in perspective. The considered engineering disciplines in the order of historically grown technologies are construction engineering, chemical engineering, aerospace engineering, urban engineering, software engineering, bio-engineering, nano-engineering, and finally cyber space engineering. Each discipline is briefly introduced, the technology at issue is described, the relevant or dominant hazards are examined, the social challenge(s) are observed, and the relevant developments in the field are described. Within each discipline the risk management strategies, the design principles promoting safety or safety awareness, and associated methods or tools are discussed. Possible dilemmas that the designers in the discipline face are highlighted. Each discipline is concluded by discussing the opportunities and bottlenecks in addressing safety. Commonalities and differences between the engineering disciplines are investigated, specifically on the design strategies for which empirical data have been collected. We argue that Safe-by-Design is best considered as a specific elaboration of Responsible Research and Innovation, with an explicit focus on safety in relation to other important values in engineering such as well-being, sustainability, equity, and affordability. Safe-by-Design provides for an intellectual venue where social science and the humanities (SSH) collaborate on technological developments and innovation by helping to proactively incorporate safety considerations into engineering practices, while navigating between the extremes of technological optimism and disproportionate precaution. As such, Safe-by-Design is also a practical tool for policymakers and risk assessors that helps shape governance arrangements for accommodating and incentivizing safety, while fully acknowledging uncertainty.",van Gelder P.; Klaassen P.; Taebi B.; Walhout B.; van Ommen R.; van de Poel I.; Robaey Z.; Asveld L.; Balkenende R.; Hollmann F.; van Kampen E.; Khakzad N.; Krebbers R.; de Lange J.; Pieters W.; Terwel K.; Visser E.; van der Werff T.; Jung D.,Journal,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2021-06-02,Toronto Metropolitan University;Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu;Radboud Universiteit;Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam;Delft University of Technology;Wageningen University & Research;Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management,Design for values ;  Responsible research and innovation ;  Risk-based design ;  Safe-by-design ;  Secure-by-design ;  Uncertainty

Recent Trends in Multipotent Human Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells: Learning from History and Advancing Clinical Applications,"Early cell biology reports demonstrated the presence of cells with stem-like properties in bone marrow, with both hematopoietic and mesenchymal lineages. Over the years, various investigations have purified and characterized mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) from different human tissues as cells with multilineage differentiation potential under the appropriate conditions. Due to their appealing characteristics and versatile potentials, MSCs are leveraged in many applications in medicine such as oncology, bioprinting, and as recent as therapeutics discovery and innovation for COVID-19. To date, studies indicate that MSCs have varied differentiation capabilities into different cell types, and demonstrate immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory properties. Different microenvironments or niche for MSCs and their resulting heterogeneity may influence attendant cellular behavior and differentiation capacity. The potential clinical applications of MSCs and exosomes derived from these cells have led to an avalanche of research reports on their properties and hundreds of clinical trials being undertaken. There is ample reason to think, as discussed in this expert review that the future looks bright and promising for MSC research, with many clinical trials under way to ascertain their clinical utility.

The impacts of design heuristics on concept generation for a COVID-19 brief,"Design heuristics (DHS) as a tool can help boost designers’ creativity in early conceptual design phases. We have developed a set of DHS for digital innovation (DHS10). There are numerous studies on DHS impacts/outcomes in the recent years. However, little research has been conducted to identify whether DHS has lasting benefits on designers’ ideation performance. This paper explores whether DHS10 can help designers achieve more creative ideas based on different design briefs, and if DHS has lasting impacts on or benefits for students. An empirical study was conducted with two groups (i.e., 32 students who learned DHS10 five weeks ago, and 24 students who studied DHS10 instantly). They were asked to address an open-ended design brief on COVID-19 and generate as many innovative ideas as possible. The results suggest DHS has impacts on students who learned DHS just now and five weeks ago. The effect is stronger on those who just learned DHS10. We suggest that DHS10 be provided for ideation as it provides texts and visual stimuli for designers. DHS10 also has the potential to help students understand digital innovation and generate ideas accordingly.",Jin X.; Dong H.; Evans M.,Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2021-06-01,Tongji University;Brunel University London;Loughborough University,Conceptual design ;  Creativity ;  Design cognition ;  Design for COVID-19 ;  Design heuristics ;  Design innovation ;  Design methods and tools ;  Education for industrial design engineering ;  Industrial design
"A unique transdisciplinary engineering-based integrated approach for the design of temporary refugee housing using kano, hoq/qfd, triz, ad, ism and dsm tools","The continued displacement of refugees from their homes and homelands (now greater than 50 million people worldwide) places increased focus and attention on evolving the designs of temporary housing that is available to be provided to the refugee population, especially in rural areas where housing does not already exist and must be constructed in very little time. Complex engineering problems involving social issues, such as this case study, benefit from the use of Integrated Transdisciplinary (TD) Tools (ITDT) to effectively and efficiently address the design questions related to them. The integrated use of TD Tools such as Kano Analysis, KJ Diagrams, Critical to Quality (CTQ), House of Quality (HOQ)/Quality Function Design (QFD), Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ), Axiomatic Design (AD), Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM), and Design Structure Matrix (DSM) through an end-to-end unique design process leads to innovation and elimination of design conflicts for especially complicated design problems. The objective of this study is to examine the design of temporary refugee housing using integrated TD tools mentioned above. This research concludes that the use of the ITDT approach provides an innovative, decoupled design.",Moran D.; Ertas A.; Gulbulak U.,Journal,Designs,2021-06-01,Edward E.

Scientific knowledge production and economic catching-up: an empirical analysis,"This paper aims to investigate the relationship between the production of scientific knowledge and level of income for a panel of 56 countries during the period 1996–2015. We argue that the accumulation of scientific knowledge is a key factor for the enhancement of educational and technological capabilities within an economy, and hence may have a positive impact on GDP per capita levels. We use academic publications in refereed journals (in all areas and specifically in engineering) as a proxy of scientific performance. As regards the impacts of scientific performance, we distinguish between high- and middle-income countries and, among the latter, between Asian and Latin America. The results show that academic publications are consistently and positively correlated with income per capita, for both middle and high-income countries. We also find non-linear effects in both groups. Those effects are lower for middle-income countries suggesting the presence of decreasing returns on academic performance. Finally, while Asian countries benefited from specialization in engineering research, no such effects were found for their Latin American peers.",Jack P.; Lachman J.; López A.,Journal,Scientometrics,2021-06-01,Universidad de Buenos Aires,C23 ;  Developing countries ;  Growth ;  Innovation ;  O30 ;  O47 ;  Science

A roadmap for research in medical physics via academic medical centers: The DIVERT Model,"The field of medical physics has struggled with the role of research in recent years, as professional interests have dominated its growth toward clinical service. This article focuses on the subset of medical physics programs within academic medical centers and how a refocused academic mission within these centers should drive and support Discovery and Invention with Ventures and Engineering for Research Translation (DIVERT). A roadmap to a DIVERT-based scholarly research program is discussed here around the core building blocks of: (a) creativity in research and team building, (b) improved quality metrics to assess activity, (c) strategic partnerships and spinoff directions that extend capabilities, and (d) future directions driven by faculty-led initiatives. Within academia, it is the unique discoveries and inventions of faculty that lead to their recognition as scholars, and leads to financial support for their research programs and reconition of their intellectual contributions. Innovation must also be coupled to translation to demonstrate outcome successes. These ingredients are critical for research funding, and the two-decade growth in biomedical engineering research funding is an illustration of this, where technology invention has been the goal. This record can be contrasted with flat funding within radiation oncology and radiology, where a growing fraction of research is more procedure-based. However, some centers are leading the change of the definition of medical physics, by the inclusion or assimilation of researchers in fields such as biomedical engineering, machine learning, or data science, thereby widening the scope for new discoveries and inventions. New approaches to the assessment of research quality can help realize this model, revisiting the measures of success and impact. While research partnerships with large industry are productive, newer efforts that foster enterprise startups are changing how institutions see the benefits of the connection between academic innovation and affiliated startup company formation. This innovation-to-enterprise focus can help to cultivate a broader bandwidth of donor-to-investor networks. There are many predictions on future directions in medical physics, yet the actual inventive and discovery steps come from individual research faculty creativity. All success through a DIVERT model requires that faculty-led initiatives span the gap from invention to translation, with support from institutional leadership at all steps in the process. Institutional investment in faculty through endowments or clinical revenues will likely need to increase in the coming years due to the relative decreasing size of grants. Yet, radiology and radiation oncology are both high-revenue, translational fields, with the capacity to synergistically support clinical and research operations through large infrastructures that are mutually beneficial. These roadmap principles can provide a pathway for committed academic medical physics programs in scholarly leadership that will preserve medical physics as an active part of university academics.",Pogue B.; Zhang R.; Gladstone D.,Journal,Medical Physics,2021-06-01,Dartmouth Cancer Center,diagnostic ;  imaging ;  invention ;  linac ;  scholarship ;  therapeutic
Fostering Ambidextrous Innovation in Infrastructure Projects: Differentiation and Integration Tactics of Cross-Functional Teams,"In infrastructure project practice, balancing and maximizing the combined effect of exploratory and exploitative innovation have attracted increasing attention, but it is still unclear how to foster ambidextrous innovation in infrastructure projects. To address this gap, we draw on the differentiation-integration framework of ambidexterity theory to deconstruct tactics for fostering ambidextrous innovation in infrastructure projects. A total of 313 observations were collected from infrastructure under construction, and the path hypotheses were tested by hierarchical regression. The findings suggest that in infrastructure projects, task conflict and expertise integration of diverse cross-functional teams provide powerful and complementary tactics for fostering ambidextrous innovation. The moderating effect of team autonomy support on the impact of team diversity on differentiation and integration tactics presents three different results. This study not only enriches the literature on how to foster ambidextrous innovation in infrastructure projects but also expands the ambidexterity research at the cross-functional team level and in infrastructure project contexts.",Zhang X.; Le Y.; Liu Y.; Liu M.,Journal,Journal of Construction Engineering and Management,2021-06-01,"Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital;Faculteit Civiele Techniek en Geowetenschappen, TU Delft;Tongji University",Ambidextrous innovation ;  Cross-functional team ;  Expertise integration ;  Task conflict ;  Team autonomy support ;  Team diversity

From trash to treasure: A checklist to identify high-potential NPD projects from previously rejected projects,"Recent research suggests that by reviewing previously rejected projects in NPD portfolios, it is possible to identify lessons learnt and better manage and handle new projects. Therefore, we argue that there might be hidden treasures in previously rejected new product projects due to recent technology developments or changes in customer preferences. However, after a systematic literature review and interviews with managers we found that there were no suitable tools available for firms to re-assess previously rejected projects. Therefore, by employing multiple qualitative methodological techniques, this study enriches the Stage-Gate model and innovation literature by developing a checklist that firms can use to identify potentially successful new products (treasures) among previously rejected projects (trash). As such, the checklist in this study is not only helpful for reducing the sunk cost associated with previously rejected projects, but can also exploit their potential for success, and become the company's new growth engine.",Qin J.; van der Rhee B.,Journal,Technovation,2021-06-01,Nyenrode Business University,Checklist ;  Innovation failure ;  NPD ;  Stage-gate model
Modeling the total heat transfer coefficient of a nuclear research reactor cooling system by different methods,"In this work, the thermal model of Triga Mark-II Nuclear research reactor working at Istanbul Technical University (ITU) Energy Institute was created. Thermal model includes mathematical equations expressing the change of water inlet-outlet temperatures of reactor tank, heat exchanger and cooling tower depending on time. By using the thermal model, the mass flow rates of the first and second cooling circuits that can affect the power of the reactor's cooling system were examined. At the same time, an equation based on NTU was generated to estimate the total heat transfer coefficient. To add originality and innovation to the study, the total heat transfer coefficient was modeled using Machine Learning Algorithms (Multilayer Perceptron, Support Vector Machine, M5P Model Tree). Model data obtained by utilizing the thermal model and machine learning were compared. As a result, the mass flow rate at which the reactor works efficiently was determined as 6.57-8.5 kg/h for the 1st cooling circuit and 11.5-13 kg/h for the 2nd cooling circuit. SVM (Puk Kernel) is the method with the least error (RMSE: 0.223) among NTU equation, Thermal model and Machine learning algorithms.",Akay O.; Das M.,Journal,Case Studies in Thermal Engineering,2021-06-01,Tokat Gaziosmanpaşa Üniversitesi;Kahramanmaras Sütçü Imam Üniversitesi,Heat exchanger ;  Heat transfer ;  Machine learning algorithms ;  Nuclear research reactor

Fostering peace engineering and rethinking development: A Latin American view,"This paper explores how peace engineering initiatives relate to the critique of development in the Latin American context. Development is an essential condition for peace, and structural violence is closely associated with patterns of development. In engineering studies, the critique of development has increased attention, explaining the initiatives towards peace engineering engaged in social transformations. We discuss the evolution of the modern notion of development and argue why we should reject the mantra of neoliberalism. Next, we shift our look to the contributions of the Latin American critique of development, from the historical liberation movements to new concepts such as post-extractivism, solidarity economy, and political ecology. A decolonial view is proposed departing from the ‘epistemologies of the South’, followed by a review of how science, technology, and innovation relate to specific exclusion forms. Further, an empirical view on peace engineering initiatives in post-conflict Colombia and Brazil is presented, including three streams of how engineering initiatives relate to social change, from the social economy to grassroots movements. Finally, we suggest a few questions for further research in peace engineering and development.",Kleba J.; Reina-Rozo J.,Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2021-06-01,Universidad Nacional de Colombia;Instituto Tecnologico de Aeronautica,Critique of development ;  Engaged engineering ;  Exclusion forms ;  Latin American critical thinking ;  Peace engineering ;  Structural violence
Research on Application of Multi-factor Surrounding Rock Pressure Calculation Theory in Engineering,"Based on the multi-factor surrounding rock pressure calculation theory, the values of surrounding rock pressure and construction safety and stability coefficients corresponding to different construction methods required by engineering design and construction could be quickly and conveniently calculated with the derived general formula, so as to guide and optimize the design and construction scheme. In this paper, the influence of lateral load coefficient on surrounding rock pressure was analyzed and verified, and the calculation method and application range of lateral load coefficient were proposed. Meanwhile, according to the multi-factor surrounding rock pressure calculation theory, an arched precast member was proposed, which was assembled into an optimal and reasonable honeycomb-like stress structure, and applied in the support of tunnel and underground space. It could improve the construction technology of composite lining by taking the advantage of the common load bearing of surrounding rock and support. In addition, with the theory, the application of arched precast member in the support of deep foundation pit has simplified the setting of lateral support of deep foundation pit in the horizontal direction, which is an innovative construction method for deep foundation pit support using prefabricated assembly components. Certainly, the calculation theory should be further studied, and the dynamic change of surrounding rock pressure after excavation under various adverse geological conditions should be accurately analyzed and verified by means of monitoring and measurement, which should be reasonably connected with the current Code for popularization and application. It is hoped that the study of the calculation theory and its application in engineering practice can provide useful guidance and help for the design and construction of tunnel and underground space.",Tong J.,Journal,KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering,2021-06-01,Lanzhou University;Ltd.,Application and innovation of support ;  Arched precast member ;  Construction safety and stability factor ;  Lateral load coefficient ;  Multi-factor ;  Surrounding rock pressure theory
Plausibility of CAAD in Conceptual Design: Challenges in Architectural Engineering for Early-Stage Digital Design Tools,"Although the reasons for and against the early use of digital tools in design have been intensively researched and studied for years, there has been a scarcity of substantial analysis of the challenges posed by using computer-assisted architectural design (CAAD) tools in the early design phase. By drawing on reviewed materials and cross-mapping digital software and current commercially available programs, this paper elucidates and evaluated the impact of CAAD tools in the early design process. In this research, a two-way, systematic mapping of research-based tools that support the conceptual design process and commercial CAAD methods was implemented, utilizing five criteria as illustrated in a recent study.

Overall optimization model of efficiency and performance of green technology innovation,"Nowadays, China's economic development is in a rapid and stable state, in which scientific and technological innovation has played a great role in promoting the development of economic society. Scientific and technological innovation is an important indicator to measure the competitiveness of modern economic society, and is also the pillar and driving force for the survival of regional economic development. It is of great significance to study the overall optimization model of efficiency and performance of green technology innovation for the development of technological innovation and sustainable economic development in China. In this paper, we analyze the dynamic change of green technology in China from the perspective of time, static innovation model and regional innovation model. The results show that the overall level of green technology innovation efficiency of China`s industrial industry is low, and the scale efficiency of enterprises is high, which indicates that enterprises rely heavily on scale level. In order to improve the overall green technology innovation efficiency, the technology and management level should be improved accordingly; the efficiency of green technology innovation varies greatly among regions, Comparing the efficiency values of southeast, middle and Northwest China, it is found that the regional development is in a very unbalanced state, especially in the northwest region, the efficiency value is low in the stage of achievement transformation.

Biomedical engineering of sclerostin action in the bone remodeling,"Mathematical modeling of biological processes has bridged the fields of experimental as well as theoretical research and has carried forward remarkable innovation. Sclerostin is a fundamental communication element for bone remodeling and its activity regulates the reabsorption and deposition of new bone tissue. During this research, we have presented several studies, which illustrate the function of sclerostin in communication with the Wnt signaling pathways. This article features the sclerostin-based pathological patterns related to diseases such as bone cancer. To have a good remodeling process, the osteocytes must recruit the pre-osteoblast cells from the mesenchymal stem cells with the help of the signal mechanism given by the Wnt pathway. The Wnt signal pathway is a complex transduction of a pool of well-conserved genes whose expression regulates various activities like gene translation, cell adhesion, cell differentiation, mitogenic stimulation and polarity cell. The complexity of the interaction of the Wnt pathway is due to the ligands of Wnt itself, to the proteins R-spondin and norrin. The receptors on the surface of the cell, then, activate a process of transduction of the intracellular signal that initiates gene transduction. The hypothesis of a sort of “steady state” has therefore proved indispensable to establish a sort of common base on which the two phases. This paper seeks to give a qualitative view of the action of sclerostin through a simple mathematical model. We use a logic related to stimulation and inhibition signals of new tissue production and illustrate the role of sclerostin in the mechanical and biochemical interaction during the bone remodeling process.",Nutini A.; Sohail A.; Farwa S.,Journal,"Biomedical Engineering - Applications, Basis and Communications",2021-06-01,"COMSATS University Islamabad, Wah Campus;COMSATS Institute of Information Technology Lahore;Centro Studi Attività Motore – Biology and Biomechanics Dept.",BMUs ;  Bone remodeling ;  Mathematical model ;  OPG ;  RANKL ;  Sclerostin
Engineering serendipity: When does knowledge sharing lead to knowledge production?,"Research Summary: We investigate how knowledge similarity between two individuals is systematically related to the likelihood that a serendipitous encounter results in knowledge production. We conduct a field experiment at a medical research symposium, where we exogenously varied opportunities for face-to-face encounters among 15,817 scientist-pairs. Our data include direct observations of interaction patterns collected using sociometric badges, and detailed, longitudinal data of the scientists' postsymposium publication records over 6 years. We find that interacting scientists acquire more knowledge and coauthor 1.2 more papers when they share some overlapping interests, but cite each other's work between three and seven times less when they are from the same field. Our findings reveal both collaborative and competitive effects of knowledge similarity on knowledge production outcomes. Managerial Summary: Managers often try to stimulate innovation by encouraging serendipitous interactions between employees, for example by using office space redesigns, conferences and similar events. Are such interventions effective? This article proposes that an effective encounter depends on the degree of common knowledge shared by the individuals. We find that scientists who attend the same conference are more likely to learn from each other and collaborate effectively when they have some common interests, but may view each other competitively when they work in the same field. Hence, when designing opportunities for face-to-face interactions, managers should consider knowledge similarity as a criteria for fostering more productive exchanges.",Lane J.; Ganguli I.; Gaule P.; Guinan E.; Lakhani K.,Journal,Strategic Management Journal,2021-06-01,"University of Bath, Department of Economics;Harvard Business School;Dana-Farber Cancer Institute;University of Massachusetts Amherst",innovation ;  knowledge production ;  knowledge sharing ;  knowledge similarity ;  natural field experiment
Technology for Social Good Foundations: A Perspective from the Smallholder Farmer in Sustainable Supply Chains,"The livelihood of smallholder farmers in emerging economies' cocoa supply chain is substandard because of fraud, exploitation, corruption, deceit, child labor, and financial exclusion, usually perpetrated by influential actors. This situation creates a social sustainability problem which needs urgent attention. Digital technologies such as sensors, drones, satellites, and blockchain show promise toward fostering social sustainability deep into the supply chain. This innovation is consistent with the United Nations 2030 sustainable development goals of transforming world economies toward a more sustainable future vision by reducing poverty and inequality. As our contribution, we adopt a traditional approach in our perspective article to initiate a scholarly curiosity to discuss and develop research needs on how to use technology to address this current and critical sustainability and supply chain concern. Blockchain can solve the inefficiencies, complexities, and other social issues of smallholder farmers in the supply chain. This article identifies some blockchain technologies in emerging economies, such as Hara Technology in Indonesia and Cellulant Agrikore Blockchain Solution in Nigeria. Again, we observed that the promise of using technology to improve smallholders' vulnerability in the cocoa supply chain remains underexploited in Africa and other emerging economies. Therefore, rigorous research on smallholders' social sustainability is needed to make sound policy recommendations. This short perspective article describes issues facing these smallholder farmers and how technology can play a role for them and their supply chains to alleviate various social and environmental concerns. Accordingly, we propose some research questions for technology, innovation, and engineering management researchers.",Quayson M.; Bai C.; Sarkis J.,Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2021-06-01,The Business School;School of Management and Economics of UESTC;Hanken - Svenska handelshögskolan,Supply chain management ;  sustainable development ;  technology
"Hydrothermal Carbonization of Organic Waste and Biomass: A Review on Process, Reactor, and Plant Modeling","Abstract: Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is an emerging path to give a new life to organic waste and residual biomass. Fulfilling the principles of the circular economy, through HTC “unpleasant” organics can be transformed into useful materials and possibly energy carriers. The potential applications of HTC are tremendous and the recent literature is full of investigations. In this context, models capable to predict, simulate and optimize the HTC process, reactors, and plants are engineering tools that can significantly shift HTC research towards innovation by boosting the development of novel enterprises based on HTC technology. This review paper addresses such key-issue: where do we stand regarding the development of these tools? The literature presents many and simplified models to describe the reaction kinetics, some dealing with the process simulation, while few focused on the heart of an HTC system, the reactor. Statistical investigations and some life cycle assessment analyses also appear in the current state of the art. This work examines and analyzes these predicting tools, highlighting their potentialities and limits. Overall, the current models suffer from many aspects, from the lack of data to the intrinsic complexity of HTC reactions and HTC systems.

The Objective-Conflict-Resolution Approach: A Novel Approach for Developing Radical and Frugal Innovation,"Despite the interest in frugal innovation, both in research and in business practice, little is known about methods, approaches, or procedures that specifically support the systematic development of frugal innovations. In this article, we propose a novel approach that can be applied for developing frugal innovations, which also appears to be suitable for developing radical innovations. We present one in-depth case study that shows how the approach can be applied for successful concept development of a frugal and even radical innovation. The study follows an exploratory action research method conducted in a U.S. engineering company over 19 months. The action research resulted in a novel approach that we call objective-conflict-resolution (OCR). Applying this approach in the company led to the development of a frugal innovation - for which a patent application was submitted - that is significantly less expensive, requires fewer resources, and offers greater ease-of-use than previous solutions. The OCR approach has two main advantages over existing approaches. It can be applied for developing frugal and radical innovations when established approaches result in rather incremental solutions (such as value engineering) and is less complex and easier to implement than existing approaches that are deliberately used for developing radical solutions (such as TRIZ).",Weyrauch T.; Herstatt C.; Tietze F.,Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2021-06-01,University of Cambridge;Hamburg University of Technology,Conceptual tools for management of technology ;  frugal engineering ;  frugal innovation ;  implementation methodologies and project management ;  management of innovation ;  management of new technologies ;  new product development ;  new service development ;  process improvement ;  product design ;  product innovations ;  project and R&D management ;  R&D management ;  radical innovation ;  technology management ;  technology management framework
Technological learning strategies and technology upgrading intensity in the mining industry: evidence from Brazil,"Despite exhaustive research on technology upgrading in firms from emerging economies—latecomer firms—we still know little about micro-level learning strategies underlying technological innovation capability accumulation, also known as technology upgrading intensity, particularly in natural resource-intensive industries. Through an empirically grounded study of Brazil’s mining industry, which holds a globally leading technological and market position, we found that: (1) leading firms implemented technological learning strategies as responses to changing windows of opportunity (demand, technological, institutional, and idiosyncratic problems); (2) these technological learning strategies manifested in various ways from imitative and defensive to offensive with elements overlapping over the technology upgrading process, involving two forms of knowledge inputs: ‘doing, using and interacting’ and ‘science, technology and innovation’, which were operationalised through various learning mechanisms; (3) the use of these learning mechanisms changed qualitatively over time affecting firms’ technology upgrading intensity positively. Thus, we further the understanding of latecomer firms’ technology upgrading by providing in-depth empirical insights through a comprehensive approach to innovation capabilities and learning strategies in an under-researched natural resource-intensive industry in a middle-income resource-rich country.",Figueiredo P.; Piana J.,Journal,Journal of Technology Transfer,2021-06-01,Fundacao Getulio Vargas;Federal Technology University of Paraná,Brazil ;  Capability building ;  Catch-up ;  Innovation ;  Mining industry ;  Technological learning ;  Technology upgrading

Research on the influence of computer information technology on rural preschool education,"With the continuous deepening of my country's education reform, the rural preschool education and teaching model is also undergoing tremendous changes. Due to the problem of educational concepts, preschool education in rural areas as a whole is still very backward. In addition, because the current kindergarten information equipment and methods are still relatively backward, teachers and students lack interest in this new teaching method and other reasons [1]. As a result, many schools still use traditional teaching materials as the main method of teaching, and it is one of the feasible and effective programs to optimize this situation by using information technology. With the development of basic education reform in our country, kindergarten teaching also needs continuous innovation and reform, and rural preschool education is the most important, characteristic and competitive curriculum in the early childhood stage. In preschool education, the classroom teaching mode is a combination of ""teaching""and ""playing""[2]. Among them, gamification, as one of the main methods, can effectively improve students' interest and enthusiasm in learning. Combine information technology with traditional classrooms, integrate modern science and technology into classrooms, and carry out teaching reforms. Multimedia technology can enrich the content, and information technology can promote the connection between knowledge points, etc. And more and more people pay attention and research.

Spatial links of the maritime scientific research cooperation network in China,"Marine science and technology are the means to develop healthy maritime productivity. In recent years, the marine economy arrived at the point of developing from high speed to high quality. China is paying more attention to how to use the sea scientifically. The development of marine science research has received more policy support. The outline of the 14th Five-Year Plan proposes to ""make breakthroughs in a number of key core technologies in the fields of marine engineering, marine resources, and marine ecology."" At the same time, urban network theory based on flow space is a mature and convenient way to measure inter-city scientific research cooperation. An analysis of the structure of this network will help clarify its structural characteristics and spatial differentiation, discover the technical opportunities of marine scientific research, and promote the coordinated development of academic research and the applied technology fields. With the help of the complex network analysis method, UCINET, ArcGIS, and string chart visualization software, this paper analyzes the overall structural characteristics and spatial differences of the marine research cooperation network in 2007 and 2017, respectively, to provide empirical support and a theoretical reference for the development and construction of the network. The results show that first, the marine scientific research cooperation network has obvious characteristics of a ""small world"" and ""scale-free"" network, with strong accessibility and agglomeration, and an improved openness; at the same time, it presents discrete trends and unbalanced characteristics. Second, different from the ""diamond"" structure of the information and innovation cooperation network, the marine scientific research cooperation network in China has formed a special ""trapezoidal"" structure with Beijing-Tsingtao—Shanghai-Guangzhou as the apex; the focal cooperation ties in the network have increased and gradually broadened. At the same time, three marine scientific research cooperation clusters with different functions, characteristics, and research fields have been formed in the Bohai Rim, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Pan-Pearl River Delta. Finally, the leading pattern of core cities has been consolidated, among which Qingdao plays a strong role as a ""throat"" and is a national marine scientific research center with a strong ability to control marine scientific resources. Some of the core nodes (such as Beijing and Wuhan) are inland, but they have a strong independent capability in marine scientific research, and an enthusiasm for engaging in scientific research cooperation; in other words, marine scientific research cooperation is characterized by significant complexity. Formation based on marine research papers in the network embodies the link between the cities. On the one hand, this reflects the influence of the research subject emphasis of the cooperation network, such as a core city taking a leading role, or being the backbone of key research institutes, etc.; on the other hand, it also reflects the network between cities that cooperate in research and the contacts that result. Exploring the marine scientific research cooperation network through marine scientific research institutions will have a positive impact on the reconstruction and network progress of national and regional marine scientific research cooperation.",Guo J.; Ding Y.; Qin Y.,Journal,Tropical Geography,2021-05-30,Liaoning Normal University;Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China,Collaboration network ;  Complex network ;  Maritime scientific ;  Urban network

Engineering Hydrogels for Efficient Solar Desalination and Water Purification,"ConspectusSafe and adequate water is a global challenge due to the growing population and pollution in the wake of natural disasters. Access to clean water is a cornerstone for the further development of our modern society. Solar-powered desalination and water purification have attracted much research attention due to the high solar-to-thermal conversion efficiency and ease of implementation in multiple scales, from compact, stand-alone devices for individual households to large, centralized dimensions for communities. Nevertheless, the generation of water vapor at low temperatures below the boiling point is usually a slow process under natural sunlight. The production rate of clean water relies on the efficiencies of solar energy conversion and utilization, which can be enhanced in two directions: systems optimization and materials innovation. Starting from bottom heating and volumetric heating, interfacial evaporation has been adopted recently to systematically reduce energy loss by localizing heat near the evaporation surface using photothermal materials. Meanwhile, carbonaceous materials, narrow bandgap semiconductors, and polymers with different structures were designed to achieve thermal management and water transport.In this Account, we highlight the recent progress of hydrogels as a highly tunable material platform for solar-powered desalination and water purification. We begin by introducing how gelation chemistry endows hydrogels with desirable properties and multiscale tunability from molecular to macroscopic levels. Then, we review three major strategies to promote efficient solar-to-vapor conversion in terms of reducing water evaporation enthalpy, optimizing heat distribution, and tailoring the evaporation surface. First, by selecting polymeric backbones with hydratable functional groups, the water state in hydrogels can be regulated to facilitate intermediate water, which has a lower evaporation enthalpy compared to that of the bulk water. This polymer-water interaction can be further tuned during synthesis and post-treatment. Second, light-absorbing additives within hydrogels should not only convert solar energy to heat effectively but also confine the heat near the evaporative surfaces. Third, since water molecules are encapsulated in the polymer network of hydrogels, the surface of the hydrogel becomes the evaporation front of liquid water. Hence, tailoring the surface topography and wettability of hydrogels has important effects on the evaporation rate. Next, we discuss key functions that endow hydrogel evaporators with excellent desalination and purification performances, including anti-salt-fouling property for stable and long-term desalination, as well as easy integration of functional materials to remove other contaminants, such as heavy metal ions and organic dyes, for greater distillate quality. Last, existing challenges and future opportunities in both fundamental studies and practical implementation of the hydrogel-based solar water purification systems are discussed.",Guo Y.; Yu G.,Journal,Accounts of Materials Research,2021-05-28,Cockrell School of Engineering,

Characteristics and Driving Factors of Spatial Association Network of China’s Renewable Energy Technology Innovation,"Based on the provincial panel data of China from 2001 to 2016, this study uses the social network analysis approach to empirically investigate the characteristics and driving factors of the spatial association network of China’s interprovincial renewable energy technology innovation. The findings are as following. 1) The spatial association of China’s interprovincial renewable energy technology innovation exhibits a typical network structure. Moreover, its network density, network hierarchy and network efficiency are 0.3696, 0.6667 and 0.7833 in 2001 and 0.4084, 0.4764 and 0.7044 in 2016, respectively, implying the spatial association network became more and more complex and the interprovincial association strengthened during the sample period. 2) This spatial association network presents a “core-edge” distribution pattern. The positions and roles of various provinces vary greatly in the spatial association network. Specifically, the developed coastal regions such as Shanghai, Beijing and Tianjin have a degree centrality, closeness centrality and betweenness centrality of above 75, 80 and 10, respectively, indicating that they always play a central role in the network. However, the northeastern regions and the relatively backward central and western regions such as Heilongjiang, Jilin, Xinjiang, Hainan and Hebei only have a degree centrality, closeness centrality and betweenness centrality of below 20, 55 and 0.1, respectively, indicating that they are at a relatively marginal position. 3) The geographical proximity and the expansion of the differences in economic development level and R&D inputs are conducive to the enhancement of the spatial association of China’s renewable energy technology innovation.",Feng C.; Wang Y.; Kang R.; Zhou L.; Bai C.; Yan Z.,Journal,Frontiers in Energy Research,2021-05-25,Shanghai University of Finance and Economics;Shandong University;Xi'an Jiaotong University;Nankai University;Northwest University,China ;  driving factor ;  renewable energy technology innovation ;  social network analysis ;  spatial association
Advances in the bioinspired olfactory sensing technology for screening of olfactory dysfunction,"The mammalian olfactory system enables to sense and distinguish a large number of odors, which is essential to find food, avoid predators, communicate and reproduce, while the human olfactory system can even avoid potential hazard by discriminating the smell quality. Olfactory dysfunction is a common disease symptom which seriously affects the life quality of patients. In addition, many studies have revealed that olfactory dysfunction can also indicate many other potential diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases and mental diseases. Olfactory dysfunction is an early common symptom of a variety of diseases, such as inflammation, viral infection, neurodegenerative diseases, and the current epidemic of COVID-19. Researchers have indicated that some patients with certain diseases already have suffered from symptoms of olfactory dysfunction early in the clinic. For instance, one of the early clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection is the loss of smell. Besides, patients suffered from Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease usually have an increased threshold of olfactory perception and even endure anosmia. Therefore, research on early screening and diagnosis of dysosmia diseases on the basis of olfactory function detection is of great significance to control and slow the disease's progression and to improve the health of human body. At present, olfactory function detection technologies mainly contain olfactory neuropsychological testing, electrophysiological detection, olfaction system structure or functional imaging, etc. Although these technologies have played an important role in the study of dysosmia, there have been no standardized detection indicators established so far. Therefore, the establishment and improvement of early olfactory dysfunction disease diagnosis technology based on the detection of olfactory function requires a novel approach in principle and technology. By utilizing the bionic olfactory sensing technologies such as bioelectronic noses, the olfactory analog sensing system with high sensitivity, high specificity and short response time, and even simulating biological olfactory systems, can be expected to be realized. Based on the current understanding of the mechanism of olfactory dysfunction, our team is committed to breaking through the traditional odor-induced olfactory function detection method. By combining with the bionic olfactory perception technology, three original methods which include olfactory neural network chip, organoid chip and neural interactive olfaction detection technology have been proposed. These three technologies essentially construct and simulate the olfactory nervous system in vitro or in vivo, by means of the sensing technique to detect physiological signals changes that correspond with the alternations in the nervous system. However, the difficulties currently lie in how to determine the characteristic physiological signal, and how to establish the correlation between the characteristic signals and the degree of dysosmia for the ultimate goal of further screening the olfactory dysfunction related diseases through the detection parameters. The clarification of these difficulties and in-depth progress of research will promote the innovation and development of olfactory function detection technology, and provide reliable theoretical technical support and experimental basis. This review comprehensively interpreted the current research status of dysosmia diseases, as well as analyzed the principles of bionic olfactory perception technology and its research progress in the detection and diagnosis of dysosmia and related diseases. With the development of multidisciplinary intersection in the field of biomedical engineering, the transformation and application of cell network chips, organoid bionic chips and braincomputer interaction technology will promote the progress of bionic olfactory perception technology in the research of olfactory dysfunction diseases and the innovation of clinical diseases diagnosis.",Zhuang L.; Liu M.; Jiang N.; Wei X.; Pan Y.; Yu Y.; Wang P.,Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2021-05-25,"Zhejiang Lab;College of Biomedical Engineering & Instrument Science, Zhejiang University;Chinese Academy of Sciences;Fudan University",Bioinspired olfactory sensing technology ;  Brain-computer interface technology ;  Cell and organoid on chip ;  Olfactory dysfunction ;  Olfactory function measurement

Eco-innovative application of phyto-raw materials in the technology of long-term storage of unrefined sunflower oil,"Along with the development of agroecosystems, environmental friendliness of agricultural and industrial technologies for long-term storage of agricultural products is being formed as a result of cognitive technologies development, including innovations in biotechnologies. Achieving the biological safety of bulk unrefined sunflower oil is based on the addition of an unconventional antioxidant phyto-raw material to it-stinging nettle, which slows down oxidative processes. In order to prevent oil contamination, the optimal dose of ionizing radiation for the nettle treatment is established-up to 1.5 kGr, which ensures microbiological safety and antioxidant activity (AOA) at the level of 0.763 + 0.016 mMeq, comparable to AOA in the untreated nettle samples after 3 months. After 52 days of storage, the acid number was in the range of 0.99-1.15 mg KOH/g, the peroxide number was 5.09-5.16 mmol active oxygen/kg. Adding 0.5-1.0 wt. % nettle powder to the oil ensures the compliance of organoleptic parameters with the established requirements-transparency, taste and smell. Adding 1.0 wt. % nettle powder to the oil slows down the filtration process of the resulting suspension. The practical relevance of the study is determined by the verification of the research results to prolong the oil shelf life by adding environmentally friendly phyto-raw materials to it.",Timakova R.; Iliukhin R.,Conference Proceeding,E3S Web of Conferences,2021-05-24,Sankt-Peterburgskij Gosudarstvennyj Universitet Telekommunikacij imeni professora Bonch-Bruevicha;USUE,
Development and testing of glow-in-the-dark concrete based raised pavement marker for improved traffic safety,"Road infrastructure has witnessed incremental changes in the past as compared to the immense development witnessed by the vehicle’s safety technology. Bott’s dots and other reflector devices are extensively used on the road infrastructure for lane separation and for improving edge detection. These devices come in a large variety of shapes and sizes, however, all of them fall under the category of retroreflectivity since they depend on vehicle lights to provide reflection. Glow-in-the-dark (GiD) material has the benefit that it can store energy during the presence of light and can emit the stored energy in the form of visible light in the absence of an external light source. In this regard, the presented research work details the development and testing of GiD concrete based markers that can be used for lane separation and edge detection. The benefit of the presented innovation is that GiD concrete based markers can be used for visible light instead of retroreflectivity in addition to acting as a driver alertness tool. The durability performance of the presented innovative GiD based raised pavement markers has been presented along with cost comparison to traditional Bott’s dot. In addition, the presented prototype can be adopted for various architectural and esthetical applications in buildings, parks, walkways and bicycle lanes etc.",Saleem M.; Hosoda A.,Journal,Journal of Civil Engineering and Management,2021-05-24,Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University;Yokohama National University,Construction materials ;  Glow-in-the-dark concrete ;  Infrastructure design ;  Performance testing ;  Road furniture ;  Traffic safety

Using mergers and acquisitions to prepare for disruption,"Industry incumbents often encounter significant troubles in the face of disruptive innovations. These types of innovations erode the existing capabilities and resources of the firm, forcing them to seek out new capabilities outside their own organization in order to remain competitive and survive. Exploitation and exploration, organizational learning strategies utilized to develop incremental and radical innovations, respectively, are considered common drivers for mergers and acquisitions (MA) among firms. MA's enable the firm to obtain new capabilities and competencies in order to respond to the threat of substitution of their current ones by disruptive innovations and new entrants employing them. According to the research, firms' operative actions are more strongly linked to preparing for disruption than strategic ones in the motives for acquisitions.",Kirjavainen J.; Makinen S.; Saari U.; Risikko K.,Conference Proceeding,"2021 IEEE Technology and Engineering Management Conference - Europe, TEMSCON-EUR 2021",2021-05-17,Tampere University,Acquisitions ;  Disruption ;  Exploitation ;  Exploration ;  Mergers
Towards a holistic view of technology commercialization,"Technology commercialization and transfer are fundamental for the supply of new innovations. However, research has predominantly focused on particular contexts (e.g. universities, technology startups, and established companies), neglecting the broader context of how technologies are developed and introduced in the marketplace. To address this gap, we present a more holistic view on technology commercialization that separates between different levels (individual-, firm-, ecosystem-, and institutional-) as well as includes a discussion on the participation of underserved populations such as women or minorities. This is followed by a discussion of future research avenues.",Neumeyer X.; Chen S.,Conference Proceeding,"2021 IEEE Technology and Engineering Management Conference - Europe, TEMSCON-EUR 2021",2021-05-17,University of North Carolina Wilmington;Huazhong University of Science and Technology,Diversity ;  Ecosystems ;  Innovation ;  Technology commercialization
Measuring the success factors of strategic design implementation,"Strategic design translates design thinking theory into the business landscape resulting in strategy development, innovation, and meaningful outcomes for both organisations and people. How this is measured is ambiguous and ill defined. It is easier to measure the tangible outcomes of a design engagement, such as new products, however it may be the more complex tacit elements that provide longer-term transformative impacts. The purpose of this research is to better understand the resulting values of a strategic design engagement to contribute to developing an appropriate metric for the success factors. A research through design approach was taken to collect data from SMEs engaging in strategic design. Analysis through visual mapping provided early-stage insights which indicate commonalities and themes that may assist with developing applicable metrics. The findings also highlight the indicative changes in approach and mindset to the company owners and the possibility of a replicability of the process, implying a new ability to continuously innovate and adapt to change. The contribution of the research is around metrics for strategy implementation which is difficult to identify and communicate and therefore often overlooked or ill defined.",Whelan L.; Kiernan L.; Morrissey K.; Deloughry N.,Conference Proceeding,"2021 IEEE Technology and Engineering Management Conference - Europe, TEMSCON-EUR 2021",2021-05-17,University of Limerick,Design ;  Innovation ;  Metrics ;  Strategy
Analytical framework for innovation in hierarchical and bureaucratic organizations,"Using grounded theory building, a 12-month longitudinal ethnography encompassing 42 individuals, 80 hours of observation, and 60 interviews was conducted to create an analytical framework to reveal interactions between hierarchy, bureaucracy, and innovation. This model presents a nuanced view of both positive and negative effects of bureaucracy and hierarchy on innovative new product development processes and technology adoption within a large, highly structured organization. The research revealed that it was possible for a team to have bureaucratic and hierarchical constraints and characteristics and still achieve innovative ends. Innovation in this context requires a problem critical to the organization to be selected, a solution to be developed, and the solution to be adopted. With this criteria, both hierarchy and bureaucracy impacted new product development processes, to both help and hinder both technology development and technology adoption.",Olney R.; Shluzas L.; Leifer L.,Conference Proceeding,"2021 IEEE Technology and Engineering Management Conference - Europe, TEMSCON-EUR 2021",2021-05-17,Stanford Engineering,Bureaucracy ;  Engineering management ;  Grounded theory building ;  Hierarchy ;  New product development

360° Virtual Tour of the Traditional Malay House as an Effort for Cultural Heritage Preservation,"The rapid growth in technology has created new innovation in the field of information technology. One of the innovations created from technological advancement is virtual reality that can be extended through virtual tour that provides real-time experience in exploring a space or an area. Nevertheless, preliminary research on the development of digital sector in heritage architecture only focused on historical site instead of building. Although there is an exploration paid to the heritage building, the effort is limited to colonial buildings and little attention has been given to the local heritage architecture. Hence, this paper aims to explore the development of 360 virtual tour of the traditional Malay house that is over 100 years old as one of an important measure to preserve, protect and interpret the built heritage and cultural history. The primary data was analysed from the building inventory through high-resolution photography using a fisheye lens digital camera. Photos collected were combined to create panoramic effect using a stitching technique. The 360 virtual tour application was developed based on the Multimedia Development Life Cycle theory. The findings show the application is produced as a digital database consisting of physical qualitative attributes data for university's management and recording for posterity. The outcome from this study has proved how technology converts the traditional learning and museum visit can become an enjoyable platform of learning, motivating and understanding of building structures and unique architectural details.",Harun N.; Yanti Mahadzir S.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,2021-05-17,Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,

A New Student Learning Outcome to Strengthen Entrepreneurship and Business Skills and Mindset in Engineering Curricula,"The Outcome-Based Education (OBE) model is being adopted by most of the reputable academic accreditation bodies and academic institutions. The model concentrates on what the students are able to do after fulfilling their program requirements. Student Learning Outcomes usually cover the needed knowledge areas and the skillset required to be attained by students to meet market-needs. In engineering education, most of the concerned accreditation bodies require to attain a set of student learning outcomes in knowledge areas, design and problem solving related to the academic program in addition to other learning outcomes that cover a set of skills needed to develop the competencies of graduating students to be ready for the jobs of future. The learning outcomes usually do not include an explicit learning outcome that concentrates on the business and entrepreneurial skillset and mindset. Having these in engineering curriculum and its' learning outcomes is becoming vital in the requirements of the jobs of future and job creation.

The Perceptions and Attitudes of Faculty Members at Jordanian Higher Education Institutions toward the use of Virtual Reality in Teaching Practical Engineering Experiments,"Due to the current circumstances of the Corona pandemic, the world has resorted to stopping direct learning and has shifted toward e- learning. However, there appeared obstacles encountered in the e-learning process, namely the practical skills and laboratory experiments that students need to supplement the teaching process. Virtual Reality (VR) techniques can provide models for experimentation with low cost in addition to the time factor savings. The main goal is for adopting an idea to use virtual reality software programs in designing scientific experiments as an alternative method for direct teaching of laboratories. In this study, the perceptions, attitudes and future aspiration of the faculty members of engineering colleges take by questionnaire about the ability to use virtual reality technology in the implementation and design of practical experiments and achieving the targeted educational outcomes.The results showed a low percentage use of VR in teaching engineering experiments because this is a new technology and there is a shortage of infrastructures such as equipment, hardware and software in addition to unavailability of workshops and training courses for faculty members and laboratory supervisors. The results also revealed positive perceptions about the importance of VR in distance learning and negative attitudes in adopting VR as an alternative method of teaching engineering experiments.",Alshqirate A.; Al-Dassean K.,Conference Proceeding,"2021 Innovation and New Trends in Engineering, Technology and Science Education Conference, IETSEC 2021",2021-05-16,Al-Balqa Applied University,Education ;  Market research ;  Pandemics ;  Software ;  Solid modeling ;  Technological innovation ;  Virtual reality
The Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic among Undergraduate Engineering Students in Jordanian Universities: Factors Impact Students' Learning Satisfaction,"The emergence of the recent COVID-19 pandemic has led to the migration of traditional learning to distance learning platforms which have become the common teaching method among educational institutions. The effective implementation of this online learning method depends on various factors affecting learners' satisfaction. The current study examines the relationship between learners' satisfaction on distance learning and factors (online learning self-efficacy, anxiety, fear of COVID-19) that impact students' remote learning experience among undergraduate engineering students in Jordanian public and private universities. Data was collected via an online survey measuring students' baseline of distance learning satisfaction, online learning self-efficacy, anxiety, and fear of COVID-19 which was distributed between June to August 2020. The participants in this study were 505 undergraduate engineering students (353 males, 152 females) who were mostly Jordanian (92.6%) with an average age of 21 (SD = 1.86). There were 298 participants from public universities (59%) and 207 from private universities (41%). Findings reported a significant gap between public and private universities students' distance learning satisfaction, online learning self-efficacy, and anxiety level while the students' scores on fear of COVID-19 was insignificant. Students in private universities were also reported to have higher baseline rates for all the constructs involved in this study. Furthermore, the online learning self-efficacy scores significantly predicted the distance learning satisfaction level among undergraduate engineering students when other constructs were treated as a constant. The findings of this study offer important implications for instructors in considering self-efficacy skills when working with undergraduate students. Limitations and recommendations for future research were also outlined.",Al-Tarawneh L.; Al-Nasah M.; Awwad F.,Conference Proceeding,"2021 Innovation and New Trends in Engineering, Technology and Science Education Conference, IETSEC 2021",2021-05-16,The University of Jordan;Princess Sumaya University,Computer aided instruction ;  COVID-19 ;  Education ;  Pandemics ;  Particle measurements ;  Sociology ;  Technological innovation

A Statistical Model for GPA Estimation Based on High School Grades and Standard Exams,"High-school grades (HSG) are often observed as unreliable measures for college admissions, and thought irrelevant to student's college performance, because of the inconsistencies in grading standards across high schools. Many colleges and universities conduct their own admission exams along with some standard language tests such as IELTS and TOEFL, such examinations are seen more reliable in providing uniform and valid measures for assessing students' capabilities and skills. This paper presents and tests three regression models for college Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) based on several estimators, those are: student high school grades, student IELTS test results and Common Educational Proficiency Assessment (CEPA).

Rural revitalization strategy and disciplinary innovation of agricultural engineering,"As long-standing goals and all-round development practices of agricultural and rural modernization of China, the rural revitalization strategy provides huge opportunities and spaces for the disciplinary innovation and development of all agricultural related disciplines. The purpose of this paper was aimed to analyze special requirements, objectives, tasks and implementation environment raised by the rural revitalization strategy, based on reviewing the references and development history of agricultural engineering, and to analyze impacts of the rural revitalization strategies on and demand for the adjustment of agricultural engineering innovation, so that to figure out the ways, means and measures for new round disciplinary adjustments and restructuring of agricultural engineering. In recent years, the disciplinary renovation and restructuring for all subjects have been encouraged and launched by the Ministry of Education, China. The new round adjustment of the discipline layout marked by the innovation and construction of new disciplines such as new engineering and new agriculture were given more attention on introducing new technological and industrial revolution achievements, and transforming and upgrading traditional engineering and agricultural science with information technology, digital technology and artificial intelligence. But it's worth noting that insufficient attention had been paid to the expansion of agricultural and rural modernization roads and changes in development patterns caused by the rural revitalization in this important adjustment process. Agricultural engineering takes multiple and wide range responsibilities in offering scientific and technological support and talent training and cultivation, so that it plays a special and key role in the modernization of agricultural and rural areas. Information, communication, intelligent and smart technologies, and all new breaking through technologies should be introduced into agricultural engineering to equip and empower it more updated and effectively. Under such a background, more efforts should also be made in such important development consequences brought by the rural revitalization strategy. The disciplinary adjustment of agricultural engineering should be restructured and optimized according to the instructions of the national development strategies and its new application areas required by agricultural and rural modernization. The more attention should be paid to the influence of social and economic development mode and structural adjustment and upgrading on innovation and its correspondence. Great attentions should be paid to following key issues: 1) The implementation of the rural revitalization strategy has opened up some new development spaces for the disciplinary innovation of agricultural engineering and proposed new development requirements. 2) The development and extension of the agricultural engineering technology systems will extend from the agricultural production to rural multi-industrial integration, relying on all agricultural and rural resources. 3) The cultivation of agricultural engineering talents and the construction of educational scientific research systems should aim at the requirements of the whole process for all rural productions, as well for the construction of rural ecological systems. 4) The systematic construction and management of agricultural and rural industries in different regions should meet the needs of the urban-rural integration development and the modernization of new rural communities' governance system. Currently, more reform, renovations and adjustments should be made to reshape the agricultural engineering to meet new needs of the rural revitalization, the new development fields and directions of agricultural engineering disciplinary innovation currently are more practical in rural e-commerce engineering, rural landscape construction and maintenance engineering, rural new industrial development space construction, rural ecological environment engineering, and rural social and economic management and governance system engineering.",Fu Z.; Zhang H.; Zhang P.; Ma Y.,Journal,Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering,2021-05-15,China Agricultural University,Agricultural engineering ;  Disciplinary innovation ;  Key directions ;  New agricultural science ;  Rural revitalization strategy

Transitioning from academic innovation to viable humanitarian technology: The next steps for the OpenFlexure project,"Academic interest in designing medical technology appropriate for Africa continues to grow, with funding available for innovations that answer complex questions. However, there is significant engineering work required to realise the promised impact of an innovation, even when it is shared as an Open Source design for others to build on. With academic innovation more highly prized by journals, funding bodies and academic institutions, this results in split priorities, and can lead to a difficult balance between the humanitarian aims of the project and pursuit of novel research. We present the OpenFlexure Microscope project as an example of an innovative academic project pushing the limits of 3D printed instrumentation. The microscope is already undergoing trials for malaria diagnosis, but significant product development is still necessary to transition the project from a prototype to a certified in-vitro diagnostic device. In this paper, we consider the engineering work that is needed to move from prototype to product, and how best to structure this work to support distributed manufacturing across Africa. We highlight the need to focus not just on the necessary engineering, but also on documenting this work so it can be understood and reproduced by any potential manufacturer.",Knapper J.; Stirling J.; Collins J.; McDermott S.; Sanga V.; Nyakyi P.; Anyelwisye G.; Austic G.; Wadsworth W.; Mkindi C.; Bowman R.,Conference Proceeding,"2021 IST-Africa Conference, IST-Africa 2021",2021-05-10,"University of Bath, Department of Physics;Department of Physics;Ifakara Health Institute;Our Sci;Bongo Tech and Research Labs",Local manufacturing ;  Microscope ;  Product development

Human-Data Interaction through Design: An explorative step from theory to practice using Design as a vehicle,"The increasing use of personal data and AI in everyday technologies has resulted in the amplification of complex and intertwined socio-technical challenges. These, often exemplified by data abuse, breaches, and exploitation, must be alleviated to support sustainable, resilient and human-centred data economies and positive global innovation. Here, we turn towards Human-Data Interaction, an interdisciplinary branch of research, inspired by HCI, that brings together diverse siloed perspectives to present three holistic response principles: data legibility, negotiability and agency. But, the emergent nature of this field calls for refinement of these theoretical tenets to help them translate into practical and tangible responses that are embedded in the technologies we create. We propose this workshop as a foundational step towards this agenda by opening these principles to the CHI community to encourage critique and dialogue about the strengths, weaknesses, value and opportunities of incorporating HDI into the design and evaluation of technology. The outcomes of this workshop, by engaging with HDI through Design, will form the basis for the next stages of research within HDI by contributing to foundational texts within academia and implementing HDI-infused systems within industry.",Sailaja N.; Lindley J.; Urquhart L.; McAuley D.; Forrester I.,Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2021-05-08,"ImaginationLancaster, Lancaster University;British Broadcasting Corporation;The University of Edinburgh;University of Nottingham",Artificial Intelligence ;  Design Research ;  Human Data Interaction ;  Personal Data
Disability Design and Innovation in Low Resource Settings: Addressing Inequality through HCI,"Approximately 15% of the world's population has a disability and 80% live in low resource-settings, often in situations of severe social isolation. Technology is often inaccessible or inappropriately designed, hence unable to fully respond to the needs of people with disabilities living in low resource settings. Also lack of awareness of technology contributes to limited access. This workshop will be a call to arms for researchers in HCI to engage with people with disabilities in low resourced settings to understand their needs and design technology that is both accessible and culturally appropriate. We will achieve this through sharing of research experiences, and exploration of challenges encountered when planning HCI4D studies featuring participants with disabilities. Thanks to the contributions of all attendees, we will build a roadmap to support researchers aiming to leverage post-colonial and participatory approaches for the development of accessible and empowering technology with truly global ambitions.",Barbareschi G.; Zuleima Morgado-Ramirez D.; Holloway C.; Manohar Swaminathan S.; Vashistha A.; Cutrell E.,Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2021-05-08,University College London;Microsoft Research;Cornell University,Accessibility ;  Cultural context ;  Low resourced settings ;  People with disabilities

Research on the Improvement of Employee's Innovation Performance under Moral Leadership,"With the rapid development of technology and economy, more and more local Chinese enterprises are gradually growing and becoming prominent in all walks of life. However, the environment is complex and changeable, and various competitors and pressures make the importance of business management more prominent. One of the main purpose of business management is to improve enterprise performance so as to obtain more profits. Therefore, enterprise managers began to take a variety of measures in order to obtain higher performance. As an effective source to improve performance, innovation has become a goal that enterprise managers are chasing. The level of innovation performance has thus become one of the standards to measure the development of enterprises. Employees are the driving force of enterprise development, many a mickle makes a muckle, so in this process, their individual innovation performance is crucial, which is directly affected by the leadership style. Leadership has always been one of the hot topics in the field of business management and it has a direct impact on the effectiveness of business management. The main purpose of our study is to explore the underlying mechanisms that how moral leadership impacts employees' innovation performance by examining positive psychological safety's moderating role and voice behavior's mediating role of subordinates. We found that moral leadership is positively correlated with employee's innovation performance and this relationship is mediated by employees' voice behavior. Our results also demonstrate that employees' psychological safety moderates the positive relationship between moral leadership and voice behavior. Compared with a high level of psychological safety, this relationship is stronger when it is low.",Fang Y.,Conference Proceeding,E3S Web of Conferences,2021-05-06,Zhejiang Gongshang University,

Utilizing Hackathons to Foster Sustainable Product Innovation-The Case of a Corporate Hackathon Series,"In order to remain competitive, software companies need to continuously develop new or advance existing products. In recent years, they have increasingly turned towards organizing hackathons for this purpose. During such events, teams of employees engage in intense collaboration over a short period of time to complete a project that is of interest to them. While research on hackathons has been growing steadily in recent years, there is a lack of studies focusing on the continuation of hackathon projects after an event has ended in particular in a corporate context. Our study aims to contribute to existing work in this area by focusing on a corporate hackathon series that was organized by a medium-sized Eastern European software company. Our findings support and extend prior research by indicating that teams consisting of members who aim to improve their skills, that engage in project focused preparation, focus on developing a functioning prototype that is aimed at the current customer base, easy to integrate, and related to existing products during the hackathon, had their projects continued in the case we studied. Moreover, we found indications for organizational commitment in the form of resources to continue a project after an event to predicate project integration. We also identified potential barriers towards this resource allocation related to prioritization and prior commitments of the organizational unit that was projected to continue a hackathon project after the event in the case we studied.",Leemet A.; Milani F.; Nolte A.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2021 IEEE/ACM 13th International Workshop on Cooperative and Human Aspects of Software Engineering, CHASE 2021",2021-05-01,Tartu Ülikool;Carnegie Mellon University;Pipedrive,Collaboration ;  Hackathon ;  Innovation ;  Project Continuation

CWE Pattern Identification using Semantical Clustering of Programming Language Keywords,"Applications are one of the most used attack surfaces, and they must be secured at source code level, early in the development phase. Developers' inherited culture of programming preserves the patterns of code writing within big organizations or developers' communities, opening an opportunity to use SAST (Static Application Security Testing) complementary solutions to identify insecure code early in the development phase. We propose an Intermediate Representation, strict enough to maintain the security vulnerabilities patterns as defined by MITRE with the Common Weaknesses Enumeration, at the same time agile enough to not strongly depend on the lexical and syntax structure of the programming language, but following programmers' behavior of writing code. The current research phase uses semantical clustering of instructions (keywords) found in C/C++ programs, based on Word Embeddings, which are transported via the resulting (numerical) Intermediate Representation to the various classifiers for security vulnerability patterns detection. We show that there is a good preservation of security patterns despite the generalization of keywords via semantical clustering. This opens an opportunity for innovation in security vulnerability patterns identification, which is more dependent on the programmers' code writing behavior than the programming language specific structure.",Zaharia S.; Rebedea T.; Trausan-Matu S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2021 23rd International Conference on Control Systems and Computer Science Technologies, CSCS 2021",2021-05-01,University Politehnica of Bucharest,Code Embeddings ;  Machine Learning ;  Software and Application Security ;  Software Security Engineering ;  Source Code Vulnerability

Recent surge in the production of electric vehicles in the wake of the current global warming scenario has strongly increased the demand for LIBs, thereby reinforcing the need for new battery chemistries as well as making the existing production chain more efficient and sustainable. Several new technologies are explored to achieve these goals. Among them, plasma technology has the potential to simplify the synthesis and modification of battery materials, enable ‘dry’ and ‘green’ processing that eliminate the need for solvents that are often toxic, expensive, flammable, and energy-intensive. In this review, we have attempted to provide an overview of state-of-the-art (scientific) research and development with respect to the application of plasma-based processes in the synthesis and modification of materials for battery components. We have explored various applications wherein plasma-based processes have been demonstrated in the processing of electrode materials, electrolytes, and separators in addition to the recent developments in the context of solid-state and flexible batteries. Our analysis shows that plasma-based technologies are slowly but steadily gaining attention in these areas. Several technical and conventional issues remain, which require innovations at the conceptual as well as engineering levels. Technical issues include the selection of appropriate plasma type and precursors, plasma density, selectivity, and a preferable shift from vacuum to atmospheric conditions. The conventional issues include the practical difficulties in converting or adapting the assembly lines to plasma-based technology. From a business perspective, all that matters is the cost per mAh g−1 of energy produced, for which, unfortunately, we do not have sufficient quantitative data yet with regard to the materials processed by plasma-based technologies. However, the battery manufacturing sector is now open for innovations like never before. Therefore, it remains to be seen how plasma technologies embrace this opportunity and penetrate the battery production sector, where the key parameters are efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Would ‘giving it the plasma touch’ bring added value to the battery manufacturing processes? That is the question we try to address in this review.",Rangasamy V.; Vanhulsel A.,Journal,Batteries and Supercaps,2021-05-01,Vlaamse Instelling voor Technologisch Onderzoek;EnergyVille,lithium metal battery ;  lithium passivation ;  plasma ;  plasma technology
Which ship-integrated power system enterprises are more competitive from the perspective of patent?,"By analyzing the relevant patent data, the technological competitiveness of enterprises can be objectively evaluated, and the research and development priorities and the technological advantages and disadvantages of each enterprise in the same field can be compared and analyzed. It is considered to be helpful in judging the patent strategy, innovation ability, and the innovation level of enterprises, which is of great practical significance. Based on the field of the ship-integrated power system as an example, considering the Derwent patent holder code, draw the integrated technical strength of ships in the field of the distribution power system; using the ideas of the Boston matrix to measure the field has the competitive advantage of enterprises; by using the social network analysis method for each enterprise, the core technology of mining, based on the S curve of the technology life cycle, analyzes the enterprise concentration each time in order to predict the future trend of development. It can be found that China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation has the largest number of patents, followed by Fuji Electric Co. Ltd, International General Electric, Daewoo shipbuilding ocean engineering Co. Ltd and so on. Considering the patent quantity and the patent quality, the dominant and productive enterprises in this field can be distinguished. The ship-integrated power system and its related core technologies have been rapidly growing at present. The related technology patents will increase rapidly in the next few years, and more and more enterprises will participate in this field.",Li D.; Li X.,Journal,PLoS ONE,2021-05-01,Wuhan University,
Validation process for rooftop wind regime cfd model in complex urban environment using an experimental measurement campaign,"This research presents a validation methodology for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) assessments of rooftop wind regime in urban environments. A case study is carried out at the Donadeo Innovation Centre for Engineering building at the University of Alberta campus. A numerical assessment of rooftop wind regime around buildings of the University of Alberta North campus has been performed by using 3D steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations, on a large-scale high-resolution grid using the ANSYS CFX code. Two methods of standard deviation (SDM) and average (AM) were introduced to compare the numerical results with the corresponding measurements. The standard deviation method showed slightly better agreements between the numerical results and measurements compared to the average method, by showing the average wind speed errors of 10.8% and 17.7%, and wind direction deviation of 8.4◦ and 12.3◦, for incident winds from East and South, respectively. However, the average error between simulated and measured wind speeds of the North and West incidents were 51.2% and 24.6%, respectively. Considering the fact that the upstream geometry was not modeled in detail for the North and West directions, the validation methodology presented in this paper is deemed as acceptable, as good agreement between the numerical and experimental results of East and South incidents were achieved.",Mattar S.; Nezhad M.; Versteege M.; Lange C.; Fleck B.,Journal,Energies,2021-05-01,University of Alberta,ANSYS CFX ;  CFD ;  Complex urban geometry ;  Experimental measurements ;  Turbulent flow ;  Validation study ;  Wind regime

The differences in the propensity of providing smart services by smes from the electrical engineering industry with regard to their cooperation and innovation flexibility,"There is still a lack of empirical evidence about smart service in general, and more partic-ularly, in small and medium sized firms (SMEs). For SMEs, where the implementation of smart technologies is more demanding, the importance of cooperation with other business partners and innovation flexibility increases dramatically. The purpose of this article is to determine how the cooperation and innovation flexibility of SMEs affect the propensity to provide smart services in the electrical engineering industry. This paper also contributes a deeper insight into the intensity scale of collaboration within SME providers of smart services regarding the types of smart services of-fered. The empirical evidence is based on quantitative and firm‐level data gathered through an email questionnaire which yielded 112 SME companies from the electrical engineering industry in the Czech Republic. The analysis is based on factor analysis, non‐parametric tests, and binary lo-gistic regression to identify the differences and effects of collaboration and innovation flexibility. The results of the factors affected confirmed external cooperation flexibility with customers and innovative flexibility in relation to the products as significant with inverse relationships between external collaboration with customers and the propensity to provide smart services. It is evident that weak ties in external customer cooperation flexibility operate as incentives or driving forces in the provision of smart services to establish closer relationships. The deeper research insights as well as the theoretical and practical implications are discussed at the end of the paper.",Kaňovská L.; Bumberová V.,Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2021-05-01,"Brno University of Technology, Faculty of Business and Management",Cooperation ;  Digitalization ;  Electrical engineering ;  Innovation flexibility ;  Smart services ;  SMEs
Study on Quantitative Analysis of Edible Oil Peroxide Value by Terahertz Time Domain Spectroscopy,"At present, Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy techniques are mainly used for qualitative analysis, but the application of THz technology can hardly be found in quantitative analysis in the detection of edible oil's quality. This paper presents an approach to analyze edible oil quality based on Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) and Terahertz Time Domain Spectroscopy(THz-TDS). Firstly, the THz-TDS of edible oil samples with different types and degrees of oxidation were collected, the effective signal band was filtered and the optical constants were extracted, the preprocessing algorithm corrected the optical constants, a variety of chemometrics methods were used to establish quantitative analysis models, in order to quickly and accurately predicted the peroxide value of edible oils. 70 experimental samples were used, including soybean oils, rapeseed oils and corn oils, the peroxide value ranged from 0.41 to 10.23 mmol•kg-1, and the peroxide value distribution of the samples was evenly distributed. A TeraPulse 4000 terahertz pulse spectroscopy system equipped with an ATR detection module belonging to TeraView was used to collect samples' THz-TDS signals. According to THz-TDS characteristics, the effective band 10 to 86.78 cm-1 was selected for modeling analysis. The frequency domain signals were obtained by fast Fourier transform, and the optical constants were extracted: refractive index and absorption coefficient. Refractive index and absorption coefficient were preprocessed separately through Savitzky-Golay 7-points convolution smoothing, which had achieved the purpose of removing interference signals. The SPXY algorithm was used to divide the calibration set, and prediction set samples in a 3:1 ratio. The peroxide value analysis models based on refractive index and absorption coefficient were established by the principal component regression algorithm and partial least square algorithm. The root mean square error and correlation coefficient of the model evaluation indexes were analyzed, the peroxide value analysis model based on the refractive index was modeled by partial least squares algorithm had ideal prediction accuracy. When the optimal principal component number was selected to be 6, RMSEC is 0.168%, R2 is 0.981, RMSEP is 0.231%, r2 is 0.977. The principal component regression algorithm modeled the peroxide value analysis model based on the absorption coefficlent, and the prediction model had the best robustness. When the optimal principal component number was selected to be 10, RMSEC is 0.192%, R2 is 0.979, RMSEP is 0.262%, r2 is 0.97. This study verifies it is feasible to detect the peroxide value of edible oil by THz technology, and the more important innovation is a high-precision, stable performance, fast and non-destructive detection method for the evaluation of edible oil quality has been found. Furthermore, this research has important guiding significance for improving the safety of edible oil quality and building edible risk assessment systems.",Liu C.; Yang Y.; Tian F.; Wu J.; Sun X.,Journal,Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi/Spectroscopy and Spectral Analysis,2021-05-01,Beijing Technology and Business University,Edible oil ;  Partial least squares ;  Principal component regression ;  Quantitative analysis ;  Terahertz time domain spectroscopy technology
Robotics for enzyme technology: innovations and technological perspectives,"Abstract: The use of robotics in the life science sector has created a considerable and significant impact on a wide range of research areas, including enzyme technology due to their immense applications in enzyme and microbial engineering as an indispensable tool in high-throughput screening applications. Scientists are experiencing the advanced applications of various biological robots (nanobots), fabricated based on bottom-up or top-down approaches for making nanotechnology scaffolds. Nanobots and enzyme-powered nanomotors are particularly attractive because they are self-propelled vehicles, which consume biocompatible fuels. These smart nanostructures are widely used as drug delivery systems for the efficient treatment of various diseases. This review gives insights into the escalating necessity of robotics and nanobots and their ever-widening applications in enzyme technology, including biofuel production and biomedical applications. It also offers brief insights into high-throughput robotic platforms that are currently being used in enzyme screening applications for monitoring and control of microbial growth conditions.

Does high crude oil dependence influence Chinese military expenditure decision-making?,"This paper employs the mixed frequency vector autoregression (MF-VAR) to discuss the causal link between crude oil dependence and military expenditure in China. The empirical results demonstrate that the crude oil dependence Granger causes military expenditure and accounts for 66.8% of the long-run forecast error variance decomposition. That means the MF-VAR model owns stronger explanatory and asymptotic powers than conventional VAR with single frequency data. Besides, the impulse-response analysis finds time varying relationship between crude oil dependence and military expenditure across four quarters within one year period. Therefore, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, especially its Navy, is needed to take responsibility and active activities to assure crude oil transport security. Government, enterprises and institutes should increase investment in military innovation to promote the upgrading of weapons and equipment. The peaceful rise strategy should be reasserted to construct harmonious international relations, which is helpful for crude oil security, foreign energy investment and reduce unnecessary military expenditure.",Wang K.; Su C.,Journal,Energy Strategy Reviews,2021-05-01,Qingdao University,Crude oil dependence ;  Economic growth ;  Military expenditure ;  Mixed data sampling ;  Mixed frequency vector autoregression
Integration and evaluation of robotic fused filament fabrication system,"Fused filament fabrication (FFF) continues to be among the most widespread additive manufacturing process for making polymeric functional prototypes, and in several cases end-use parts. There is a large installed base of serial-link industrial robots, some of which could be potentially retrofitted with an extruder head as an end-effector to serve as FFF systems with as many as six degrees of freedom compared to 3-axis gantry mechanisms that are typically deployed today. This paper identifies and proposes solutions to key engineering challenges that arise in retrofitting such robotic FFF systems in terms of integrating robot motion controller with extruder controller and evaluating the quality of the fabricated parts. Specifically, we propose an approach for integration and real-time synchronization of controllers to ensure that the extrusion velocity and deposition velocity match closely by building upon an analytical model for predicting road geometry as a function of process parameters. Compared to gantry mechanisms, this is challenging in serial-link industrial robots because of significantly larger and space-variant inertias. Furthermore, to compensate for distortion in the bed surface of the retrofitted robotic FFF system, a bed compensation algorithm based on bilinear interpolation has been developed. We have engineered a fully functional research testbed in which integration and real-time synchronization of controllers is achieved by (1) communicating space-variant process parameters in real-time using TCP/IP sockets, and (2) analog and digital I/O interfacing. Experimental testing shows excellent (R2 = 0.9983) agreement between requested and actual volumetric flow rates and less than 5% errors in extrusion widths and heights in test samples fabricated across the range of physical limits of FFF process parameters. The testbed is also evaluated in terms of the impact of controller synchronization on the part dimensional accuracy for simple and complex geometries. This work can serve as a basis for further engineering innovations towards cost-effectively harnessing the capacity of industrial robots to manufacture geometrically accurate parts using FFF.",Badarinath R.; Prabhu V.,Journal,Additive Manufacturing,2021-05-01,Penn State College of Engineering,Bed compensation ;  Controller synchronization ;  Fused filament fabrication ;  Road geometry ;  Robotics ;  System integration
GaN FinFETs and trigate devices for power and RF applications: Review and perspective,"Gallium nitride (GaN) is becoming a mainstream semiconductor for power and radio-frequency (RF) applications. While commercial GaN devices are increasingly being adopted in data centers, electric vehicles, consumer electronics, telecom and defense applications, their performance is still far from the intrinsic GaN limit. In the last few years, the fin field-effect transistor (FinFET) and trigate architectures have been leveraged to develop a new generation of GaN power and RF devices, which have continuously advanced the state-of-the-art in the area of microwave and power electronics. Very different from Si digital FinFET devices, GaN FinFETs have allowed for numerous structural innovations based on engineering the two-dimensional-electron gas or p-n junctions, in both lateral and vertical architectures. The superior gate controllability in these fin-based GaN devices has not only allowed higher current on/off ratio, steeper threshold swing, and suppression of short-channel effects, but also enhancement-mode operation, on-resistance reduction, current collapse alleviation, linearity improvement, higher operating frequency, and enhanced thermal management. Several GaN FinFET and trigate device technologies are close to commercialization. This review paper presents a global overview of the reported GaN FinFET and trigate device technologies for RF and power applications, as well as provides in-depth analyses correlating device design parameters to device performance space. The paper concludes with a summary of current challenges and exciting research opportunities in this very dynamic research field.",Zhang Y.; Zubair A.; Liu Z.; Xiao M.; Perozek J.; Ma Y.; Palacios T.,Journal,Semiconductor Science and Technology,2021-05-01,Virginia Tech College of Engineering;MIT School of Engineering;Xidian University,
Making useful knowledge for heat decarbonisation: Lessons from local energy planning in the United Kingdom,"Heat decarbonisation is challenging in many countries, but few studies address its ‘wicked problem’ qualities and the implications for producing useful knowledge. This paper elucidates the challenges by applying insights from science and technology studies, especially Callon's concept of knowledge ‘frames’, to explain the fate of a prominent UK innovation – the EnergyPath Networks (EPN) and Local Area Energy Planning (LAEP) tool of the Smart Systems and Heat programme. The aim of the tool, which coupled an engineering model with local planning, was to provide authoritative knowledge to support local decision making. However, after six years of piloting with local authorities the future take-up of EPN and LAEP remained uncertain, for two key reasons. First the techno-economic knowledge frame encountered numerous overflows emanating from more potent political-economic and technological perspectives governing local priorities. Second the framing of local decision making neglected the marginality of energy planning at local government level. Our analysis shows the problems that arise when lab-based research and development prematurely frame energy system problems, before encountering societal and political contexts of use. Problem definitions and solutions for heat decarbonisation based predominantly on technical–economic knowledge lack requisite authority to progress this wicked problem, and must become more context-responsive.",Cowell R.; Webb J.,Journal,Energy Research and Social Science,2021-05-01,The University of Edinburgh;Cardiff University,Energy ;  Framing and overflowing ;  Heat decarbonisation ;  Knowledge frames ;  Local energy planning ;  Wicked problems
Regional difference and convergence analysis of marine science and technology innovation efficiency in China,"Based on panel data of 11 coastal provinces and cities in China during 2006–2015, stochastic frontier analysis(SFA) is used to calculate the efficiency of marine science and technology innovation in this study. Then, the regional differences and influencing factors of this efficiency are analyzed, and finally, a panel unit root test method is used to conduct a stochastic convergence analysis of the efficiency of marine science and technology innovation. According to the results, the overall marine science and technology innovation efficiency shows an upward trend during the statistical period and substantially differs among the 11 coastal provinces and cities. Among them, the 10-year average efficiency of marine science and technology innovation in Shandong province is the highest. In addition, there is a significant negative relation between the degree of government support and efficiency of marine science and technology innovation. The scale of marine scientific research institutions, structure of scientific research personnel, development degree of marine economy, and structure of marine industry have significant positive impacts on the marine scientific and technology innovation efficiency. In summary, there is no stochastic convergence among the Bohai Rim, Yangtze River Delta, and Pan-Pearl River Delta regions. Expanding the scale of marine scientific research institutions and promoting the development of senior personnel in the marine industry, development of marine secondary industries, and integration of marine science and technology innovation with economic development are expected to play positive roles in improving the marine science and technology innovation efficiency.",Li G.; Zhou Y.; Liu F.; Tian A.,Journal,Ocean and Coastal Management,2021-05-01,"Shandong University, Weihai;Jiangsu University of Science and Technology;Zhongnan University of Economics and Law",Marine science and technology innovation efficiency ;  Panel unit root test ;  Regional difference ;  Stochastic convergence ;  Stochastic frontier analysis
Spatial characteristics and its driving factors of low-carbon energy technology innovation in China: A gravity movement and exploratory spatial data analysis,"Low-carbon energy technology innovation is increasingly recognized as an essential driver for mitigating the global climate change. Using the patent data from 31 Chinese provinces for the period of 2000–2017, this study develops an integrated methodological framework combining gravity model, Shapley decomposition method, index decomposition method and exploratory spatial data analysis to identify the spatial characteristics and its driving factors of China's low-carbon energy technology (LCT) innovation. Three aspects are covered, including alternative energy production technology (AEPT), energy conservation technology (ECT) and nuclear power generation technology (NPGT). The results show that the gravity centers of the total LCT and AEPT patent applications moved toward China's southwest, while those of ECT and NPGT patent applications moved toward China's northeast and southeast, respectively. The northern coastal China was the main engine region for the gravity shifts of the total LCT patent applications and AEPT patent applications, while the southern coastal China was the top engine region driving the gravity shift of ECT patent applications. Both northern and southern coastal China played the major roles in driving the gravity shift of NPGT patent applications. Among four drivers, technology priority was the major driving factor for the increases of all types of low-carbon energy technology innovations in China's eight regions, followed by economic scale and R&D efficiency, while the effect from R&D share was the smallest. All types of low-carbon energy technology innovations presented significant spatial dispersions at the provincial level. Most provinces presented Low-Low clustering in 2000 and 2017, while most coastal provinces transferred from Low-Low clustering in 2000 to High-Low clustering in 2017. Finally, some policy suggestions are proposed for China to promote LCT innovation.",Zhang X.; Geng Y.; Tong Y.; Kua H.; Tian X.; Wu R.; Zhao X.; Chiu A.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2021-05-01,ECUST School of Business;De La Salle University;Shanghai Jiao Tong University;Nanjing Normal University;National University of Singapore,China ;  Driving factor ;  Gravity shift ;  Low-carbon energy technology ;  Spatial characteristics
Technologies for safe and resilient earthmoving operations: A systematic literature review,"Resilience engineering relates to the ability of a system to anticipate, prepare, and respond to predicted and unpredicted disruptions. It necessitates the use of monitoring and object detection technologies to ensure system safety in excavation systems. Given the increased investment and speed of improvement in technologies, it is necessary to review the types of technology available and how they contribute to excavation system safety. A systematic literature review was conducted which identified and classified the existing monitoring and object detection technologies, and introduced essential enablers for reliable and effective monitoring and object detection systems including: 1) the application of multisensory and data fusion approaches, and 2) system-level application of technologies. This study also identified the developed functionalities for accident anticipation, prevention and response to safety hazards during excavation, as well as those that facilitate learning in the system.

A New Measurement Conception for the ‘Doing-Using-Interacting’ Mode of Innovation,"The ‘doing-using-interacting’ (DUI) mode of innovation describes informal innovative activities and it can be juxtaposed with the ‘science-technology-innovation’ (STI) mode based on deliberate research and development. While both modes contribute substantially but differently to technological progress, our empirical understanding of DUI mode innovative activity suffers from the lack of a comprehensive measurement approach. While empirical measurement of the STI mode is well established, empirical indicators for DUI activities are scarce and no consensus has emerged concerning its constituting learning processes. We propose a new measurement conception for innovative activity and based on 81 in-depth interviews with German firms and regional innovation consultants. We derive fifteen categories of DUI mode learning processes and a comprehensive set of 47 indicators comprising both established and new DUI indicators for empirical measurement. This new measurement conception and the respective indicators provide a holistic perspective and their application can be used to increase our understanding of the importance of DUI mode innovative activity, as well as guiding policy-makers.",Alhusen H.; Bennat T.; Bizer K.; Cantner U.; Horstmann E.; Kalthaus M.; Proeger T.; Sternberg R.; Töpfer S.,Journal,Research Policy,2021-05-01,Georg-August-Universität Göttingen;Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena;Syddansk Universitet;Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Universität Hannover,DUI ;  innovation indicator ;  learning process ;  measurement ;  modes of innovation ;  STI
Isomorphic difference: Familiarity and distinctiveness in national research and innovation policies,"Global research and innovation policies appear remarkably similar on a number of dimensions, including preferred principles of clustering and partnership, an emphasis on research-led growth and a focus on ‘hot topics’ such as nanotechnology and big data. However, policies for this field also reflect deeper-rooted traditions, institutional processes and ways of working: what looks the same can be very different when viewed in context. In this paper, we first consider the evidence for convergence across research and innovation policies before outlining perspectives based on contextual difference. Drawing particularly upon institutional theory, organizational studies and Science & Technology Studies (STS), we introduce the concept of ‘isomorphic difference’ as a means of symmetrically exploring relations of familiarity and distinctiveness. An illustration from Danish research and innovation policy is developed in order to bring together these conceptual but also policy-related issues. In addition, an initial analytical framework is presented. Finally, the relevance of ‘isomorphic difference’ to larger contemporary debates over the direction of research and innovation is summarized.",Irwin A.; Vedel J.; Vikkelsø S.,Journal,Research Policy,2021-05-01,Copenhagen Business School,Institutional theory ;  Isomorphism ;  Organizational studies ;  Policy translation ;  Research and innovation policy ;  Science & Technology Studies
How open is innovation? A retrospective and ideas forward,"This paper sheds fresh light on our 2010 paper How Open Is Innovation by taking into consideration notable developments in innovation over the last decade. The original paper developed four types of openness: sourcing, acquiring, selling, and revealing. Reflecting on important technological, organizational, and societal changes in the past decade, we highlight how these changes prompt novel questions for open innovation. While the core features of the original framework still stands, there are many new questions that have emerged in recent years. We end by charting a path for future research that emphasizes opportunities, costs and tradeoffs between different modes of open innovation, the need to better understand the nature of data, new organizational designs and legal instruments, and multilevel aspects and relationships that affect the extent and nature of openness.",Dahlander L.; Gann D.; Wallin M.,Journal,Research Policy,2021-05-01,ESMT Berlin;University of Oxford;ETH Zürich;Chalmers University of Technology,"Innovation ;  Open innovation ;  Retrospective, review, sharing, openness"
Patent Quality: Towards a Systematic Framework for Analysis and Measurement,"The quality of novel technological innovations is extremely variable, and the ability to measure innovation quality is essential to sensible, evidence-based policy. Patents, an often vital precursor to a commercialised innovation, share this heterogeneous quality distribution. A pertinent question then arises: How should we define and measure patent quality? Accepting that different parties have different views of, and different sets of terminologies for discussing this concept, we take a multi-dimensional view of patent quality in this work. We first test the consistency of popular post-grant outcomes that are often used as patent quality measures. Finding these measures to be generally inconsistent, we then use a raft of patent indicators available at the time of grant to dissect the characteristics of different post-grant outcomes. We find broad disagreement in the relative importance of individual characteristics between outcomes and, further, significant variation of the same across technologies within outcomes. We conclude that measurement of patent quality is highly sensitive to both the observable outcome selected and the technology type. Our findings bear concrete implications for scholarly research using patent data and policy discussions about patent quality.",Higham K.; de Rassenfosse G.; Jaffe A.,Journal,Research Policy,2021-05-01,Motu Economic and Public Policy Research;École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne;Brandeis University;Hitotsubashi University;Queensland University of Technology,patent citations ;  patent policy ;  patent quality ;  patent value ;  patents ;  technological impact
Managing the COVID-19 emergency: A coordination framework to enhance response practices and actions,"The global outbreak of the coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) showed how epidemics today can spread very rapidly, with potentially ruinous impact on economies and societies. Whereas medical research is crucial to define effective treatment protocols, technology innovation and social research can contribute by defining effective approaches to emergency management, especially to optimize the complex dynamics arising within actors and systems during the outbreak. The purpose of this article is to define a framework for modeling activities, actors and resources coordination in the epidemic management scenario, and to reflect on its use to enhance response practices and actions. We identify 25 types of resources and 8 activities involved in the management of epidemic, and study 29 “flow”, “fit”, and “share” dependencies among those resources and activities, along with purposeful management criteria. Next, we use a coordination framework to conceptualize an emergency management system encompassing practices and response actions. This study has the potential to impact a broad audience, and can opens avenues for follow up works at the intersection between technology and innovation management and societal challenges. The outcomes can have immediate applicability to an ongoing societal problem, as well as be generalized for application in future (possible although undesired) events.",Margherita A.; Elia G.; Klein M.,Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2021-05-01,Università del Salento;Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Coordination practices ;  Dependencies ;  Emergency management ;  Framework ;  Response actions ;  System
Transfer scouts: from intermediation to co-constructors of new knowledge and technologies in Germany,"The increasing relevance of scientific knowledge for production and innovation requires new instruments for establishing closer relationships between academia and industry. In order to strengthen such relationships, higher education institutes (HEIs), including universities, have institutionalized intermediary organizations such as technology transfer offices (TTOs). It is only recently that research on these organizations has extended its focus from analyzing their functions and performance to the internal processes and practices of their work. Based on qualitative data derived from a process-related focused ethnography, this paper presents insights into the practices of a group of “transfer scouts”. Their distinctive feature is that they are deployed explicitly on the basis of their own scientific and engineering expertise to intensify the university-industry linkages in an East German region. Apart from mere mediation, these transfer scouts become co-creators of new knowledge and technologies in transfer processes. Their orientation towards science, their thematic specialization, their development of digital transfer instruments, their explicit intention to contribute to regional development, as well as their cross-institutional acting keeps them involved in co-creational and multidirectional knowledge-production and makes them active participants in those processes. For transfer intermediaries, these insights offer an extension of their identity as brokering actors between the academic and the business sectors. Since diverse actors operate in the regional transfer system and confront transfer scouts with tensions between cooperation and competition, negotiation processes can be fiercely contested, met by resistance, and accompanied by conflicts. With regard to complementary practices, as well as in the case of constructive relationships, a durable cooperation between TTOs and transfer scouts promises to generate potentially innovative impulses. But this is less a stable setting than an ongoing process that requires many additional functional competencies and supporting structures to be provided by the organizations. The question arises, whether such complex KTT structures can be successfully institutionalized outside the frame of a fixed term project. Only then is it possible to create realistic expectations towards KTT-intermediaries and establish transfer scouting as an attractive profession in its own right in the entrepreneurial university.",Noack A.; Jacobsen H.,Journal,Research Policy,2021-05-01,Brandenburgische Technische Universität Cottbus,co-construction ;  co-evolutionary knowledge production ;  focused ethnography ;  intermediation ;  knowledge and technology transfer (KTT) ;  Transfer scouts
Connecting others: Does a tertius iungens orientation shape the relationship between research networks and innovation?,"Research on social networks and innovation emphasizes that individuals spanning structural holes and crossing institutional boundaries have more opportunities for knowledge recombination and innovation involvement. However, transforming the potential knowledge and resources available through personal networks to attain innovation can be difficult for the focal individual. Using an ego-network approach, this study examines whether and to what extent an individual strategic orientation to cooperation (i.e. tertius iungens) contributes to strengthening the relation between two personal network properties (structural and institutional separation) and involvement in innovation. Our analysis is conducted in the context of biomedicine, where research networks are particularly relevant for science and innovation achievements.

"Experimental investigation and performance comparison of a 1 single OWC, array and M-OWC","Ocean wave energy continues to develop through innovation and a growing number of collaborations around the world. With the vast resource of wave energy on our doorstep it remains a focal point in ocean energy engineering with great potential. In order for wave energy to become more competitive and a serious player in the renewable energy mix, such innovations should not only benefit the wave energy sector but also other technological applications by providing attractive options for synergies in novel projects. This paper concerns the experimental investigation of Oscillating Water Column (OWC) Wave Energy Converter (WEC) technology and its potential as a Multi-Oscillating Water Column (M-OWC). This research investigation utilises a progressive and pragmatic experimental modelling approach, by cross comparing the models of a single standalone OWC, an OWC array and finally a modular M-OWC under the same environment and test conditions. Performance and characteristic responses are analysed while varying the values of OWC spacing, damping and wave conditions. The results indicate that the spacing of OWC chambers significantly affects the performance of an M-OWC. While performance improves with the increase of spacing, the efficiency of the M-OWC is greater than that of a single OWC or the OWC array at reduced spacing values. In addition, the results indicate that an OWC array is less efficient by having individual power take-off systems operating in isolation as opposed to the modular M-OWC.",Doyle S.; Aggidis G.,Journal,Renewable Energy,2021-05-01,"Department of Engineering, Lancaster University",Experimental modelling ;  Ocean energy ;  Oscillating water columns ;  Renewable energy ;  Wave energy ;  Wave energy converters
Open government data portal usability: A user-centred usability analysis of 41 open government data portals,"Open government data, as a phenomena, may be considered an important and influential innovation that has the potential to drive the creation of public value via enabling the prevention of corruption, increase in accountability and transparency, and driving the co-creation of new and innovative services. However, in order for open government data to be fully taken advantage of, it must be found, understood, and used. Though many countries maintain open government data portals, the usability of said portals can vary greatly; this is important to understand as the usability of a portal likely impacts the eventual reuse of the data made available there. Acknowledging the importance of portal usability to the data reuse process, this paper helps to elucidate some initial insights by asking two questions: “How can the usability of open government data portals be evaluated and compared across contexts?” and “What are the most commonly missing usability aspects from open government data portals?”. In order to answer these research questions, a subset of 41 national open government data portals were selected for an in-depth usability analysis drawing on the feedback from 40 individual users. As a result of this analysis, the paper is able to make three primary contributions: (1) the validation of a framework for open government data portal usability analysis, (2) develops an initial comparative international ranking of open government data portal usability, and (3) identifies commonly occurring portal usability strengths and weaknesses across contexts.",Nikiforova A.; McBride K.,Journal,Telematics and Informatics,2021-05-01,Hertie School;Latvijas Universitāte,Open data ;  Open data portal ;  Open government data ;  Usability
Prospects for critical thinking in Russian science education,"The lack of consensus on the formulation of the concept of ""critical thinking"" has determined the existence of different approaches to teaching critical thinking, among which one can distinguish an ""interdisciplinary"" approach based on ""universal"" definitions and a disciplinary approach based on context-dependent definitions. The choice of approach largely depends on the educational traditions of the society. For the Russian educational community, which traditionally values subject knowledge, a disciplinary approach is more acceptable. Natural sciences have a high potential for the development of critical thinking due to their close relationship with informal logic and the scientific method. To realize this potential, it is necessary to change the goals of learning from memorizing and reproducing knowledge to shaping the thinking of a student who is able to find, evaluate, assimilate and apply this knowledge in new situations, creating innovations. This inevitably entails a change in the learning model. An important question is what should this model be? A model that relies on the essence of science as a process of discovering something new while following the scientific method is proposed. The model is based on a combination of the problem method and practical project activities. The problematic method is realized through a new type of assignments for natural science-natural science cases, which serve as simulators of ""making discoveries"" by recreating the situation of scientific search. Some cases reproduce situations of really perfect scientific discoveries (for example, the discoveries of Galileo and Mendeleev), and some suggest finding ideas for engineering and technological solutions to still unsolved problems (such natural science cases are called STEM-cases). Case assignments guide students along the path of the scientific method and serve as simulators for the development of those components of critical thinking that are included in the context-dependent definition of critical thinking (rationalism, logic, creativity, reflection and metacognitivism). STEM-cases are miniprojects carried out in small groups that prepare you to work on an individual project. The most important thing in an educational project is to go through all the stages of the scientific method and, as a result, get a product that has a certain degree of objective novelty-that is, innovation. Research involving students from three Moscow universities has shown that the «case + project» strategy has a positive effect on both the development of critical thinking components and the academic performance of students.",Solodikhina M.; Solodikhina A.,Book,Perspectives on Critical Thinking,2021-04-28,Moscow Pedagogical State University;HSE University;RUDN University,Creativity ;  Critical thinking ;  Natural science ;  Natural science case ;  Project activities ;  Scientific method

The Effect of Technology Innovation on Corporate Sustainability in Chinese Renewable Energy Companies,"Technology innovation has become the main driving force of China’s economic growth. Sustainable development highlights the harmonious symbiosis of the economy and the ecological environment. Renewable energy companies characterized by technology-intensive and environmental friendliness are playing an increasingly important role in achieving economic development while alleviating environmental pressure. Therefore, this paper selects the A-share renewable energy listed companies in China between 2014 and 2019 as samples, using the fixed-effect model and the logit model to explore the effect of technology innovation on corporate sustainability. We find that technology innovation has a positive effect on both financial sustainability (FS) and social and environmental sustainability (SES). Due to the imbalance of regional social and environmental development and different degrees of emphasis placed on environmental and social responsibility, the positive impact of technology innovation on SES is heterogeneous between the east and the central and west regions. Moreover, as the strategic emerging industry, although the renewable energy industry is granted lots of subsidies from the government, the results show that when government subsidies exceed the threshold, the effect of technology innovation on FS is weakened. Government subsidies have a negative moderating effect on the relationship between innovation and SES. Furthermore, we subdivide government subsidies into government subsidies beforehand (GSB) and government subsidies afterwards (GSA). We reveal that the threshold effect of government subsidies mainly comes from GSA, while the moderating effect of government subsidies is caused by GSA and GSB. This paper is an expansion and enrichment of current studies on sustainable development and also puts forward feasible suggestions for the government to formulate precise and effective subsidy policies to stimulate technology innovation.",Wang P.; Zhang Z.; Zeng Y.; Yang S.; Tang X.,Journal,Frontiers in Energy Research,2021-04-27,China University of Petroleum-Beijing,corporate sustainability ;  government subsidies ;  renewable energy company ;  technology innovation ;  threshold effect

The role of causal knowledge in the evolution of traditional technology,"Humans occupy a wider range of environments, process more energy, and have greater biomass than any other species because we are able to culturally evolve complex, locally adaptive technologies.1 Competing models make different predictions about the role of causal knowledge in this process. Some argue that innovation and transmission cannot occur without causal understanding,2–5 while others posit that complex technologies can evolve without causal understanding.1,6–10 Prior research on this topic has been restricted to theoretical work and experimental studies with student participants.11–13 The Hadza are foragers who rely on bows for subsistence.14–16 We interviewed skilled Hadza bowyers (bow-makers) and compared their beliefs regarding the tradeoffs in bow construction to those revealed by experimental and engineering research. If bowyers understand the tradeoffs, it is plausible that cultural evolution is rooted in causal understanding, while if they do not, the cultural accumulation of knowledge is likely more important in the process. We show that Hadza bowyers understand some mechanical trade-offs but not others, and therefore the evolution of a complex, highly adaptive technology is possible with incomplete causal knowledge regarding key mechanical trade-offs. Instead, some important design choices made by subjects seem to reflect cultural norms. Although previously published reports have suggested that some individuals are recognized by the Hadza as being especially skilled or knowledgeable,14,17 our results do not indicate that some individuals are significantly more knowledgeable about bow-making than others, nor is there statistical evidence that causal knowledge increases with age.",Harris J.; Boyd R.; Wood B.,Journal,Current Biology,2021-04-26,"Institute of Human Origins;University of California, Los Angeles;Max-Planck-Institut für Evolutionäre Anthropologie",cognitive niche ;  cultural evolution ;  evolution of technology ;  human adaptation ;  hunter gatherers

Technological innovation and achievements in the exploration and development of shale gas in complex mountainous areas: A case study of the Zhaotong National Shale Gas Demonstration Area,"Marine shale gas in China is mainly distributed in the Yangtze Block, including the Sichuan Basin, the Yangtze River Basin and the surrounding areas, which is one of the most realistic areas of shale gas exploration and development at home. The Zhaotong National Shale Gas Demonstration Area is located in the central-western area of Weixin sag, Dianqianbei depression, i.e., the southern margin zone of the low-steep fold felt in the southern Sichuan Basin, and it is a typical mountainous block of South China. Under the influence of complex topography, strong tectonic event, fault development and high thermal evolution degree, shale gas exploration and development in this area is difficult to some extent. In order to realize the scale benefit development of shale gas in complex mountainous areas, PetroChina Zhejiang Oilfield Company has been continuously carrying out practical shale gas exploration and development in the complex zone of Dianqianbei structure in recent years. Based on the productivity construction in the Zhaotong National Shale Gas Demonstration Area, innovation and breakthroughs are made in the basic geological theory study and low-cost engineering technology research of complex mountainous shale gas, and the ""three-factor control reservoir"" accumulation and occurrence theory, shale reservoir classification and evaluation standard and target evaluation system of complex mountainous shale gas are established. The seismic anisotropy processing and sweet spot prediction technology and the seismic-geology-engineering integrated evaluation technology are formed. The environmentally-friendly high-performance water-based drilling fluid for horizontal wells is developed, and the rate of penetration improvement technology for shale gas horizontal wells is optimized.

Efficient development technology slope-type strongly heterogeneous shale gas reservoirs: A case study on the Longmaxi Formation shale gas reservoir in the Weiyuan area of the southern Sichuan Basin,"The efficient development of the slope-type strongly heterogeneous shale gas reservoir of Lower Silurian Longmaxi Formation in the Weiyuan area of the southern Sichuan Basin faces several difficulties, such as long drilling cycle, difficult formation of complex fracture network, and low single well production. In view of this, one theory and four key technologies are developed after years of technological innovation, technological research and production practice, which provide effective support for the efficient construction of the Weiyuan National Shale Gas Demonstration Area. And the following research results were obtained. First, the differential enrichment theory of slope-type shale gas reservoir in the setting of paleouplift is put forward, namely ""sedimentation area selection, tectonic zonation and preservation controlling reservoir"". The multi-stage structure superimposed marine shale gas zone evaluation and sweet spot selection technology is developed. The organic-rich siliceous shale in the middle and lower parts of S1l1 layer is determined to be the optimal target in the vertical direction. The core productivity construction area covers 165 km2, where the deployed wells have an average daily gas production of 27×104 m3 during the testing and the EUR is more than 1.1×108 m3. Second, the efficient navigational drilling technology with geology-engineering integration guided technology and efficient long horizontal section drilling technology as the core for the horizontal well with a narrow target is developed, and the rate of penetration (ROP) improvement model of shale gas well is established. The drilling cycle is shortened by 33.1%, the drilling rate of quality shale reservoir is increased to 97.2%, and the extension capacity of horizontal section exceeds 3 000 m. Third, based on the dynamic propagation model of hydraulic fracture network, the volume fracturing optimization technology for strongly heterogeneous shale reservoir is developed, and the key evaluation indexes can be predicted quantitatively, including net fracturing stimulation area dimension, stimulated reservoir volume, effective stimulation volume and propped fracture area. The sanding intensity is increased from 1.3 t/m to 2.7 t/m, and the stimulation effect is improved. Fourth, the main factors controlling the productivity of shale gas wells in the Weiyuan area include Long111 reservoir thickness, pressure coefficient, total gas content, perforation cluster quantity, sanding intensity and fracturing horizontal section length. Thanks to the application of the shale gas well production performance prediction method based on general regression neural network and modified embedded discrete fracture model, the coincidence rate of shale gas well production performance prediction result is close to and even higher than 95%.",Wang Z.; Zhang Q.; Liu Z.; Li Y.; Li Y.; He F.; Zhao H.,Journal,Natural Gas Industry,2021-04-25,China National Petroleum Corporation,Efficient development ;  Layer evaluation and zone selection ;  Navigational drilling ;  Production performance prediction ;  Slope-type strongly heterogeneous shale gas reservoir ;  Southern Sichuan Basin ;  Volume fracturing ;  Weiyuan area

While extant research focused primarily in the adoption of cloud technology in the purview of students, this study captures an equally important perspective through investigating the effects of support from management and regulation and its influence in cloud adoption from the standpoint of teachers. Using the Theory of Reasoned Action, a validated scale was administered to 176 teachers and a Partial Least Square Structural Equation Model was applied to test a set of hypotheses. Subjective norms and attitude have a positive influence on the behavioral intention to use cloud-based educational platforms and subjective norms has a direct and significant influence on attitude. Additionally, management support has positive influence on the behavioral intention to use cloud technology. Contrary to prior research, this study finds no significant relationship between regulatory support and the intention to use cloud-based educational platforms. We discuss the limitations of this study while outlining the various implications of our study and future scholarly opportunities.",Ebardo R.; Padagas R.; Tuazon J.,Conference Proceeding,"2021 IEEE 8th International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Applications, ICIEA 2021",2021-04-23,José Rizal University,cloud adoption ;  cloud technology ;  management support ;  regulatory support ;  Theory of Reasoned Action

Development of a BIM-VR application for e-learning engineering education,"Building Information Modeling (BIM) is arguably the most important and promising ICT applied in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. One of the most important dimensions of BIM is its implementation for Virtual Reality (VR) to simulate and interact inside virtual environments of construction projects. The benefits of using BIM and VR with educational purposes has been explored recently by separate, however there is no evidence of an approach that develops and implements both technologies together. The research in this study is the first one in developing the framework for the implementation of a user-friendly BIM-VR software application with specific pedagogical objectives for AEC education. This study demonstrates that the development of this high-tech educative tool aims to: 1) make more effective use of learning hours through playful interaction with BIM models, and 2) improve understanding of abstract complex concepts that are difficult to explain theoretically. The implementation of this technological tool is developed in the context of national AEC higher education programs in a university in Mexico. In this study, the effectiveness of using a collaborative BIM-VR tool as a didactic method for AEC is demonstrated. Also, this study demonstrates that the learning experience can be improved using BIM-VR.",Sanchez B.; Ballinas-Gonzalez R.; Rodriguez-Paz M.,Conference Proceeding,"IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON",2021-04-21,Tecnológico de Monterrey,BIM for education ;  Educational innovation ;  Engineering education ;  Higher education ;  VR for education
Product validation in creative processes: A gender perspective in industrial design projects,"Design education and practice are continuously evolving. Educational institutions must include intellectual complexities and new curriculum to support good design education. The design education future emerges multidisciplinary knowledge, teaching innovation and employment necessities. This paper describes a methodology centered in product validation with industrial design students. Focusing on discovering the student experience during the project execution, in addition to observing closely the female design student's perception on the methodology and process developed. The academic project was the design of a novel tool board. The students developed the proposed project in a period of eight weeks. Sixteen students participated as a sample of this research. The methodology consisted of eight phases that spanned from project brief to project conclusion, introducing two phases focused on validation exercises for the elements created to reach the solution of the tool board. During the end of the two evaluation phases, two surveys were applied asking for information on his previous experience during his design education and three elements that assessment the design methodology implementation: utility, novelty, and relevance. Using multiple choice and Likert scale answers the students answered the surveys. The survey's findings revealed relevant information on the project implementation focused on evaluation phases during the product design. The results revealed how students reflected on their previous experience developing projects, and how the design tool board integrate important phases like validation. Also, the students evaluated with a positive value the utility, novelty, and relevance of the developed project. However, the most important finding was the female perception comparing male students. The female assessment of novelty and relevance increased during project implementation, highlighting novelty as a perceived element to a greater range than men.

Pedagogical innovations with a gender approach to increase computer programming self-efficacy in engineering students,"This study seeks to identify the effect that in-class teamwork activities have on the technical roles assumed by female engineering students in computer programming courses. During 2018 and 2019, a mixed methodology research was conducted in 2 phases. First, a qualitative study that consisted of 15 in depth interviews with current and former female engineering students. In addition, the research team conducted non-participatory observations in 2 courses, to identify elements of group dynamics in mixed gendered classes. This qualitative phase informed the quantitative study designed in the second phase. The quantitative phase took place in two computer programming courses associated to an undergraduate engineering program: Course A, which uses traditional lecture classes, and Course B, which uses project-based learning as the teaching methodology. In course B, a questionnaire (91 responses) was applied to identify the dynamics of role assignment in their teams. A self-efficacy questionnaire on computer programming was applied to courses A (n=33) and B (n =46) to compare the experience of women in the modality of individual and group work. The results indicate that women in course B tend to assume roles of coordination and work management, unlike men who define themselves as programmers or designers. The non-parametric tests applied indicate that when comparing the start and end of the course, the men and women of both courses significantly increased their overall self-efficacy. However, if only items that include execution tasks are considered, women in course B do not significantly improve their self-efficacy, unlike men from course B and both women and men from course A. Pedagogical recommendations are presented to improve self-efficacy of female engineering students in group-work based courses in computer programming subjects.",Jimenez P.; Pascual J.; Espinoza J.; Martin S.; Guidi F.,Conference Proceeding,"IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON",2021-04-21,Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso,Computer programming ;  Engineering education ;  Gender in STEM ;  Self-efficacy
An exploration of the efficacy of project-based assessment as a tool to promote basic research skills at undergraduate level in South African rural universities,"The importance of research as a vital tool for problem-solving and enriching livelihoods cannot be overstated and yet most South African universities introduce the component of research at the post-graduate level leaving out students who do not enroll for postgraduate studies without this critical skill. The lack of a dedicated research module at the undergraduate level is critical as it hampers critical thinking, entrepreneurship innovation and negatively impacts problem-solving to address societal-based problems. The case of University X in the Eastern Cape province in South Africa is that of a remote and rural university that is challenged by many negative factors ranging from, but not limited to; poverty-stricken students, poor infrastructure, and a weak staff complement in terms of qualification level as well as their research output. The problem of low research activity and knowledge generation keeps holding the university back and hence the need to look at ways to improve research activity both at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The purpose of this study is to explore methods that can be used to encourage research development at the undergraduate level to close the research skill gap currently being experienced by the 85% of students who do not progress with their postgraduate studies. An experimental research design was used to assess the contributions of project-based assessment as a tool for transferring research skills at the undergraduate level. In this study, 122 respondents (control group =38, experimental group = 84) participated in the study. Respondents from the experimental group were given project-based assessments and traditional tests, while those from the control group were given traditional tests only. A questionnaire was then given to both groups to compare the contribution of project-based assessments as a tool for transferring research skills. The findings showed that project-based assessments improved students' research skills and also that they promoted students to engage in research activities. Researchers recommended that the project-based assessments be developed in a balanced way that will expose students to research in totality.",Risinamhodzi D.; Matobobo C.,Conference Proceeding,"IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON",2021-04-21,Walter Sisulu University,Project-based assessment ;  Research ;  Undergraduate
Strengthening of women's leadership in STEM educational environment through social networks: Case of success with international network,"Several studies suggest that women are inspired by female role models. Observing women with successful development in their profession inspires other women to pursue professional growth as well, even in STEM areas, where there is less female participation. This research presents a successful case of a program with two differentiating characteristics: the use of social networks to present a group of female leaders like a role model in STEM, and an international strategic link. The objective of the program was to strengthen women leadership in the STEM educational environment, as well as to identify the determining factors for this strengthening. In the webinar program developed over a 6-month period, more than 700 people were impacted, with more than 22, 000 views. Through feedback surveys and data regarding audience obtained from the webinars transmitted by social networks, the impact and needs of teachers were shown. The results indicate that the majority of the audience teaches classes in elementary and middle levels, however, it is observed that teachers from all educational levels participated. The presence of female role models teaching in STEM programs and their extensive experience in current social happenings are two elements that favor interest and participation in these events.",Robles L.; Martinez M.; Prieto V.; Catinsani M.; Salgado R.,Conference Proceeding,"IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON",2021-04-21,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Educational Innovation ;  Female Leadership ;  Higher Education ;  Women in STEM
Acquiring an overcoming attitude in students of computer technologies by troubleshooting challenge,"Average students are satisfied with the learning obtained through the activities indicated in the course program. It is necessary to innovate in the educational process so that students find more meaning in their learning process, incorporating the experience of similar situations in the workplace, motivating a constant improvement and stimulating the development of creative thinking for the solution of problems.Research suggests that when teachers challenge students with problems according to reality, it increases confidence and motivation for learning in them.In the present work, we share the experience of incorporating a 'challenge' in the Analysis and Design of Algorithms course, where through the simulation of a job interview of a software development company, students are motivated to work 'an extra time'.",Gonzalez-Guerra L.; Martinez R.,Conference Proceeding,"IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON",2021-04-21,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Attitude of improvement ;  Challenge ;  Educational innovation ;  Higher education ;  Problem-solving skills
Mentoring program: Women supporting women,"Gender equity and inclusion have been relevant topics in the agenda of the companies, organizations and universities. As a university and particularly with engineering, science and technology programs, it is relevant to implement actions that encourage this culture of gender equity in a STEM environment. The main initiatives are related to mentoring programs, which seek to develop and empower women through women themselves. The research aims to identify the factors that influence the impact generated by the mentoring process in the different stakeholders: teachers, researchers and high school students. The mentoring model is composed of three key elements: (a) massive session with life testimonies of engineering and science students, (b) massive session with the testimonies of mentors and mentees, and (c) the mentoring sessions in small groups or one-to-one. The methodology is of a mixed nature and is composed of 4 stages: (1)design of the mentoring program based on the research of literature review and interviews with companies that has experience in mentoring programs, (2) implementation of the mentoring program with high school students and women STEM professors mentors, (3) evaluation of the impact of the program with interviews with mentors, observation, focus groups with mentors and mentees, and surveys, (4) definition of the impact factors and improvement areas of the program. The findings in the different stages allowed to integrate the factors that impact the mentoring process and its involved stakeholders. Some of the factors that influence the impact of the mentoring program are: the role of the mentor and its characteristics, the mentee profile, its commitments and interests, the impact of the life testimony both professional and personal, the type of needs that arise for the mentees and for the mentors, the time of attention, and the interaction.",Ruizcantisani M.; Lara-Prieto V.; Garcia-Garcia R.; Ortiz M.; Flores E.; Romero-Robles L.,Conference Proceeding,"IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON",2021-04-21,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Educational Innovation ;  Gender equality ;  Higher Education ;  Women in STEM

Building a truly inclusive protocol for students with disabilities from an experience in STEM areas,"Three of the most reported strategies for students with disabilities (SWD) along their stay in higher education institutions include adapting changes in management and facilities through protocols that focused on Admission, Retention and Graduation. These strategies are important, although they do not guarantee full inclusivity during the teaching, learning and evaluation process. In this work, through a qualitatively methodology, we describe the perceptions of inclusivity of five lecturers, eight undergraduates and one SWD in science courses for Computer Systems Engineering. Furthermore, we report one successful experience to design an inclusive evaluation in a Mathematics course. The evidence found in this work suggests that the center of every protocol for SWD should be focused on Attention, as a new and longer stage.

"India industry-university collaboration - A novel approach combining technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship","Research in fast-evolving technologies like AI ML requires the collaborative effort of various stakeholders including industries and universities. In developed economies, industry-university collaboration (IUC) is mature and delivers benefits to both stakeholders. In a developing nation like India, there is relatively less emphasis on IUC and when present, is restricted to a small set of premier institutions. At the undergraduate level, the collaboration between industry and university is very minimal to none. This poses major challenges to industry (insufficient qualified talent pool, higher cost of training fresh recruits, limited choice of external research partners) as well as universities (curriculum lagging latest technology, not reaching full research and innovation potential, source for research funding). This paper summarizes the IUC effort undertaken by Intel Technology India Ltd and the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship at PES University to create mutually rewarding outcomes for both partners and describes a new model encompassing technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship in addition to the traditional elements of IUC. We present the IUC considerations and processes adopted to deal with the challenges and share the outcomes and impact at the end of two years of engagement and hope that key aspects of this IUC can be leveraged by other industry and university stakeholders for mutually rewarding outcomes.",Prasad S.; Bhat R.,Conference Proceeding,"IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON",2021-04-21,Intel Technology India Pvt Ltd.;PES University,Advanced Driver Assistance System ;  Artificial Intelligence ;  Deep Learning ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Higher Education ;  Industry-University Collaboration ;  Innovation ;  Machine Learning ;  Research ;  Technology

Teamwork with an automatic tutoring environment as learning strategy in programming courses,"Students' current learning styles require consideration in the models that support and promote students' motivation for learning and develop their creative thinking skills. Programming teachers use several strategies to achieve student learning. One of the most promising is teamwork, as it encourages learning about code development and increasing student motivation and confidence.In addition, it is important to support students with adequate tutoring that allows them to find solutions to the problems they face.Research suggests that teamwork for programming courses is an excellent strategy to acquire programming skills since it facilitates knowledge sharing in an effective way among students; nevertheless, teamwork does not guarantee individual learning, so professors must verify individual learning abilities as well.During this study, we exposed the students to solved problems with programming in collaborative exercises. These kinds of activities had the possibility of being divided into small subproblems. Each of these subproblems was solved individually by the team members. After all the parts are correctly solved, they are putting together to solve the global problem, this methodology confirming individual learning in all the collaborative activities in programming courses.",Leal-Flores A.; Gonzalez-Guerra L.,Conference Proceeding,"IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON",2021-04-21,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Automatic Tutoring ;  Educational Innovation ;  Higher Education ;  Motivation ;  Teamwork Learning

Under the background of the engineering education reform, there are many problems in the undergraduate education at this stage, such as the outdated teaching materials, a single training mode, and the lack of innovation and cross-border integration. Taking the speciality of Process Equipment and Control of East China University of Science and Technology as an example, this paper puts forward the practice teaching mode of “one core, two wings, two wheel drive”. The innovation and entrepreneurship is the main body (one core), and the office of academic affairs takes charges of the overall planning and the in-depth development of various colleges (two wings), so as to create an integrated high-quality scientific and technological innovation platform of “teaching, scientific research and innovation practice”. The design of the cross spiral promotion of “theory teaching” and “innovation and entrepreneurship practice” is for the double wheel drive curriculum system, to achieve the “learning and doing” organic combination, complementing with each other, constantly improving the students’ comprehensive quality and engineering practice level, and cultivating innovative talents.",Ma X.,Journal,Mechanics in Engineering,2021-04-20,East China University of Science and Technology,Engineering education ;  New Engineering ;  Practice teaching mode ;  Process equipment and control ;  Speciality construction
Technological learning and innovations of manufacturing firms in selected ASEAN countries: An implication for future collaboration with Taiwan,"This chapter summarises the situation regarding innovation and technological upgrading in selected Southeast Asian countries based on surveys and case studies of selected industries, sponsored by the Economic Research Institute of ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) from 2008 to 2017. As time passed, firms in Southeast Asia innovated more and upgraded their technological capabilities. They conducted more R&D, though most were done informally. They leveraged more with external actors like transnational corporations (TNCs) and, more recently, universities. They performed better in key industrial sectors, namely, electronics, automotive and resource-based industries. However, in machinery industry, technological upgrading is still limited. Being part of production networks of TNCs helps these firms, especially in automotive and electronics sectors, jump-started their businesses and enabled them to acquire production capabilities. Nonetheless, to upgrade their technological capabilities to more sophisticated levels, firms had to pursue independent technological learning paths. This has an implication for future collaboration with Taiwanese firms, well known for design and advanced engineering capabilities, both in existing and new industries.",Intarakumnerd P.,Book,Industrial Development of Taiwan: Past Achievement and Future Challenges Beyond 2020,2021-04-19,National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,

Research Priorities for Coastal Geoscience and Engineering: A Collaborative Exercise in Priority Setting From Australia,"We present the result of a collaborative priority setting exercise to identify emerging issues and priorities in coastal geoscience and engineering (CGE). We use a ranking process to quantify the criticality of each priority from the perspective of Australian CGE researchers and practitioners. 74 activities were identified across seven categories: Data Collection and Collation, Coastal Dynamics and Processes, Modelling, Engineering Solutions, Coastal Hazards and Climate Change, Communication and Collaboration, and Infrastructure, Innovation, and Funding. We found consistent and unanimous support for the vast majority of priorities identified by the CGE community, with 91% of priorities being allocated a score of ≥ 3 out of 5 (i.e., above average levels of support) by ≥ 75% of respondents. Data Collection and Collation priorities received the highest average score, significantly higher than four of the other six categories, with Coastal Hazards and Climate Change the second ranked category and Engineering Solutions the lowest scoring category. Of the 74 priorities identified, 11 received unified and strong support across the CGE community and indicate a critical need for: additional coastal data collection including topographic and bathymetric, hydrodynamic, oceanographic, and remotely sensed data; improved data compilation and access; improved understanding of extreme events and the quantification of future impacts of climate change on nearshore dynamics and coastal development; enhanced quantification of shoreline change and coastal inundation processes; and, additional funding to support CGE research and applications to mitigate and manage coastal hazards. The outcomes of this priority setting exercise can be applied to guide policy development and decision-making in Australia and jurisdictions elsewhere. Further, the research and application needs identified here will contribute to addressing key practical challenges identified at a national level. CGE research plays a critical role in identifying and enabling social, environmental, and economic benefits through the proactive management of coastal hazard impacts and informed planning to mitigate the potential impacts of growing coastal risk, particularly in a changing climate. The prevalence and commonalities of the challenges faced by coastal communities globally due to increasing pressures from coastal hazards in a changing climate suggest that our findings will be applicable to other settings.",Power H.; Pomeroy A.; Kinsela M.; Murray T.,Journal,Frontiers in Marine Science,2021-04-13,School of Environmental and Life Sciences;Griffith University;The University of Western Australia;The University of Sydney,climate change ;  coastal research ;  community ;  engineering ;  geoscience ;  management ;  policy ;  priorities

Towards impact-based flood forecasting and warning in Malaysia: A case study at Kelantan river,"Impact-based forecasting and warning services aim to bridge the gap between producers and users of warning information by connecting and increasing synergies between the components of effective early warning systems. In this research, we proposed an automated warning message based on colour codes to trigger risk mitigation actions at the local level in the flood-exposed communities of Kelantan river basin, Malaysia. With a community-based approach for different groups of users (i.e. sectors), flood-impact scenarios were determined from past events and related to colour codes. These were developed into impact-based forecasting and warnings that can connect water levels, through the colour code, to localised guidance information tailored to sectors’ needs on how to respond to the expected flood. Overall, the colour coded impact-based warnings were found to be an easy and understandable way to link water level forecasts to the necessary risk mitigation actions. However, further investigation is needed to validate these findings under real-time conditions. IBF has vast potential in Malaysia, but its integration requires significant institutional changes, such as an inter-facing agency (long term) or team (short term), adjusted policy frameworks (standing orders on disasters), and new resource allocations for skills development and technological innovation from national to local levels. Overall, this paper aims to offer the first insight into impact-based forecasting and warning services in Malaysia to trigger further research and project developments.",Sidek L.; Basri H.; Mohammed M.; Marufuzzaman M.; Ishak N.; Ishak A.; Omar B.; Osman S.; Ramly S.; Hassan M.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,2021-04-07,Universiti Tenaga Nasional;Jabatan Pengairan dan Saliran Malaysia,

Simulation Based Virtual Testing for Safety of ADAS Algorithms - Case Studies,"Automated Driving Systems (ADS) make the driving experience safer, more efficient, and comfortable by performing complex maneuvers, preempting potential risky situations, or taking over the driver's tasks in critical situations. Innovation acceptance research for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) illustrates the increasing demand for safety and comfort as the two prime movers of the ADAS market. Since ADAS technologies have significant impact on human lives, extensive testing and validation throughout the design process is indispensable. Due to complexity of systems, cost of testing, and safety of test engineers, a significant chunk of ADAS calibration and validation needs to be done virtually. Although simulation-based verification and validation (V&V) is not new, the test descriptions, modeling and simulation framework are not yet well established. Off-the-shelf software tools have different architectures, simulation procedures, data standardizations, and tradeoffs. The underlying question remains- ""How to ensure that a simulated test scenario actually tested or validated the ADAS algorithm?""This paper attempts to better understand the basic requirements to successfully test common ADAS algorithms by describing a generalized structure of simulation framework essential to successfully run the safety tests. The study also emphasizes how variability across different simulators may cause discrepancies in the results. The scenarios are built in two different simulators which have unique features, methods and assumptions that must be well-understood for the results to be proven valid. Finally, the essential features of simulators are documented to understand the effect of simulator specific scenario parameters on the success of test simulations via test-of-tests.",Singh H.; Midlam-Mohler S.; Tulpule P.,Conference Proceeding,SAE Technical Papers,2021-04-06,The Ohio State University,

Neuro-competence approach for sustainable engineering,"Manufacturing systems under Industry 4.0, and their transition towards Industry 5.0, take into account the Quintuple Helix innovation model, associated with the sustainable development goals (SDGs) set by the UN and Horizon 2030, in which companies focus on operational efficiency in terms of the use and minimisation of resources for the protection of the environment. In this respect, the implementation of the circular economy model, which requires engineers to acquire appropriate competencies, enabling companies to establish this model at the manufacturing level. Moreover, competence has always been a priority for both the professional and the company. In this sense, connectivism has been called a learning theory for the digital era; this is the reason why a review of the state-of-the-art developments of this paradigm focused on engineering has been carried out. In this sense, the potential of the digital transformation in instruction to formulate an engineering model based on neuro-competences is of great interest, taking the connectivist paradigm as a methodological axis. To this end, a first bibliometric analysis has been carried out to identify the drivers on which to base the design of the neuro-competencies of the instructional engineering environment and the trend towards curriculum development under dual training models. The bibliographical research carried out on the connectivist paradigm has served to identify the trends followed to date in education within the subject area of engineering. These trends have not fully taken into account the leading role of the human factor within the socio-technical cyber-physical systems of sustainable manufacturing (SCSSM). The focus was more on the technology than on the adaptation of the uniqueness of the human factor and the tasks entrusted to him, which entails an additional complexity that needs to be addressed in both academic and professional contexts. In light of the foregoing, an improvement to the acquisition and management of competencies has been proposed to the academic, professional and dual engineering contexts. It is based on the transversal inclusion of the concept of neuro-competence applied to the competence engineering (CE) model, transforming it into the neuro-competence engineering (NCE) model. The foregoing provides a better match between the characteristics of the human factor and the uniqueness of the tasks performed by the engineer, incorporating activity theory (AT), the law of variety required (LVR), the connectivist paradigm and neuroscience as a transversal driver of innovation through fractality. This proposal enables a ubiquitous and sustainable learning model throughout the entire academic and professional life cycle of the engineer, placing it sustainably at the heart of the instructional and professional cyber-physical socio-technical system, thus complying with the SDGs set by the UN and Horizon 2030.",de Miranda S.; Córdoba-Roldán A.; Aguayo-González F.; Ávila-Gutiérrez M.,Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2021-04-02,Universidad de Sevilla,Circular economy ;  Cyber-physical systems ;  Industry 5.0 ;  Manufacturing ;  Neuro-competence ;  SDG ;  Sustainable engineering

A system dynamic approach for simulation of a knowledge transfer model of heterogeneous senders in mega project innovation,"Purpose: The owners of mega projects typically assemble multiple academic research units and enterprises to form an innovation alliance, which carries out knowledge transfer and knowledge creation targeting technical challenges in the process of engineering construction. Due to high technical and management complexity of mega projects, factors affecting knowledge transfer among innovation subjects are complex and diverse. This study proposes a mixed system dynamics (SD) method to build and simulate the process of knowledge transfer in mega projects innovation and analyzes the driving mechanism that enhances knowledge stock of enterprises and engineering innovation results. Design/methodology/approach: First, this paper proposes a conceptual model for knowledge transfer in mega projects by adopting event analysis of the data gained from investigations and interviews. Then, a qualitative model of knowledge transfer that considers mutual influences of the owner, academic research unit and enterprises is developed. Based on that, mathematical relationship among variables of the qualitative model is determined and a quantitative model of knowledge transfer that considers heterogeneity of knowledge sender is built. Finally, simulation is achieved using Vensim software. Findings: The factors affecting knowledge stock of enterprises are analyzed from three aspects: (1) the individual motives and capability of academic research units and enterprises; (2) the gap between academic research units and enterprises; (3) the heterogeneity of academic research units. The results show that the willingness and capability of knowledge reception by enterprises, specific knowledge transfer context such as relational distance and organization distance between academic research units and enterprises and academic research units with high knowledge stock have key influences on the knowledge stock of enterprises. Research limitations/implications: Factors affecting knowledge transfer within the alliance of innovation in mega projects and their correlations are highly complicated and difficult to determine. Despite massive investigations and interviews on many long-span bridges in China in this study, it is barely possible to directly obtain accurate data for all variables in the model. Limitations of historical data result in limitations on applications of the proposed model. Practical implications: By building the mega projects knowledge transfer model and conducting simulation analysis, this paper has generated practical values for the owners of mega projects on fostering, organizing, coordinating and managing of innovations. Especially, this study provides specific strategies and suggestions on selection of innovation subjects, motivation and guaranteed efficiency of knowledge transfer and knowledge creation of academic research units and enterprises. Originality/value: This study proposes a conceptual model for factors affecting knowledge transfer that applies to innovations in mega project context, which fills the gap in the research of knowledge management in mega project innovations. Additionally, combining with the method of SD, the unique role of owner in knowledge transfer of mega projects and the differences among various knowledge senders and their influences on knowledge stocks of enterprises are thoroughly considered, and the research method of modeling and simulation of knowledge transfer mechanism is supplemented and extended.",Liu H.; Yu Y.; Sun Y.; Yan X.,Journal,"Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management",2021-04-02,Nanjing Audit University;Nanjing University,Driving mechanism ;  Influencing factors ;  Innovations in mega projects ;  Knowledge transfers ;  Partner heterogeneity ;  System dynamics
The roles of captains in megaproject innovation ecosystems: the case of the Hong Kong‐Zhuhai‐Macau Bridge,"Purpose: The megaproject is a vital innovation ecosystem for participants engaging in technological adoption and integration to achieve project goals. The purpose of this paper is to examine how ecosystem captains build and operate a megaproject innovation ecosystem (MIE). To be more specific, we conducted an in-depth case study to identify the roles played by ecosystem captains in establishing and managing a megaproject innovation ecosystem. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge project, the data we collected range from 2010 to 2019 and include semi-structured interviews, informal conversations, and archival documents. We employed an inductive theory building approach to address our research question and analyzed our data using the coding process and Atlas.ti software. Findings: We find that the ecosystem captains themselves are client organizations that have evolved with the ecosystem during four distinct yet inter-related phases. In addition, we find that the captains’ roles of the client organizations include two typical activities: ecosystem establishment and ecosystem collaboration. The ecosystem captains first frame problems, plan innovative activities, set rules, and select participants for the establishment of the ecosystem, and then orchestrate resources, buffer conflicts, incorporate innovative networks, and cultivate an innovation culture to create a collaborative ecosystem. Originality/value: This study proposes a theoretical framework showing how ecosystem captains engage in MIE to manage innovative activities during different stages. It highlights the importance of captainship roles in client organizations in a megaproject.",Chen H.; Jin Z.; Su Q.; Yue G.,Journal,"Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management",2021-04-02,Antai College of Economics and Management;Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Authority,Ecosystem captain ;  Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge ;  Inductive theory building ;  Megaproject innovation ecosystem
Enlightenments of Duvernay shale gas development in the Western Canada Basin on the shale gas exploration and development in South Sichuan,"Duvernay area is one of the major shale gas development blocks in the Western Canada Basin. As marine shale gas, Duvernay shares many similarities with South Sichuan shale gas. Through comparative analysis, there are some differences between them, which are mainly reflected as follows: The sedimentary environment of South Sichuan shale gas is complex and the reservoir heterogeneity is strong, so the requirements are rather higher for the engineering technology and operation. In South Sichuan, the ground construction difficulty and cost are higher because of the mountains and hilly landform; coupled with the climate factors, the spring and autumn are the best periods for the productivity construction. Due to the differences in the national incentive policy, land acquisition procedures, safety and environmental protection and other objective factors, the development difficulties are not the same. Based on the comprehensive study on Duvernay's exploration and development experiences, several inspirations and suggestions were presented for the exploration and development of the shale gas in South Sichuan and China. The mature decision-making process for the unconventional oil and gas projects is the basis for the successful development of Duvernay shale gas, so it is suggested to attach importance to the early exploration and evaluation of the shale gas and establish the scientific exploration and development template as soon as possible; the technical progress is the key to the benefit development in Duvernay, thus it is suggested to strengthen the technological innovation, speed up the research and development of the core technologies, and solve the technical problems in the development as soon as possible; the information sharing is the catalyst for the Duvernay's technological progress and benefit development, consequently it is suggested to optimize and improve the information platform, find the balance between the share and secrecy accurately, and furthermore give full play to the advantages of the information.",Ye C.; Liu Y.; Yang J.,Journal,Petroleum Geology and Oilfield Development in Daqing,2021-04-01,Daqing Oilfield Company Limited;China National Petroleum Corporation,Duvernay ;  full life cycle ;  information sharing ;  shale gas ;  South Sichuan area ;  technological innovation ;  Western Canada Basin
Research on an innovative seismic reduction and isolation system based on preload restrainer for bridges,"Seismic isolation bearings and dampers are often utilized to reduce seismic responses of small and medium-span beam bridges in high-intensity seismic areas. Conventional seismic isolation devices have the problems with durability in the atmospheric environment with much lower service life than bridge structure, while superstructure cannot be self-centered after an intense earthquake. An innovative bridge seismic isolation system based on the combination of elastic multi-linear preload restrainer and rubber slide bearing is proposed. Through pseudo-static test on actuator and dynamic analysis with FEM software, constitutive relationship of the restrainer and seismic performance of the system are studied. The results show that the system effectively restrains the seismic internal forces and displacements of bridge piers by dissipating seismic energy, and manages to realize self-reset after an earthquake, which is considered as a viable and novel seismic system for small and medium-span bridges.",Zheng W.; Xie H.; Gao W.; Liu H.; Tang G.,Journal,Journal of Natural Disasters,2021-04-01,Ltd.;State Key Laboratory of Bridge Engineering Structural Dynamics,bridge engineering ;  elastic multi-linear ;  restrainer ;  seismic reduction & isolation

Fifty years of University-industry collaboration: A global bibliometrics overview,"This article presents a bibliometric overview of publications on university-industry collaboration (UIC) from the last fifty years (1969-2018). Among the results that were obtained, three main ones come to light. First, this article presents a complete panorama of UIC research from the past fifty years. Secondly, we were able to note that the UIC research trajectory can be divided into four generations which are represented by different phases: the discovery phase (1969-1979), the development phase (1980-1999), the expansion phase (2000-2010) and the consolidation phase (2011-2018). Furthermore, the connections and evolution pertaining to these four generations were identified. The third result was the identification of eight research trends within the UIC context: 'UIC topics' (especially: motivation, channels, barriers and results), 'engineering education', 'societies and institutions', 'knowledge transfer', 'innovation', 'entrepreneurial university', 'sustainability' and 'developing countries'.",Bastos E.; Sengik A.; Tello-Gamarra J.,Journal,Science and Public Policy,2021-04-01,Universidade Federal do Rio Grande,bibliometrics ;  generations ;  innovation ;  research trends ;  university-industry collaboration
Crack porosity estimation model based on VG-PENG shrinkage characteristic curve and soil shrinkage anisotropy,"Soil shrinkage and cracking are essential behavior during dehydration in the environmental geotechnical engineering of farmland. Their quantification can be necessary to determine the soil physical-hydraulic parameters and crack preferential flow in soils. In the present study, a new predicting model was proposed for the crack ratio with respect to soil water content using a VG-based soil shrinkage characteristic curve and soil shrinkage anisotropy factor. The migration and transition of pores were also considered in the solid-liquid-gas phase system in soil matrix-subsidence-crack domains. This model included a VG-based soil shrinkage characteristic model, a shrinkage anisotropy model using a Logistic curve, and the soil cracking ratio model. An indoor experiment was conducted to investigate the soil shrinkage characteristics and cracking behavior. The crack ratio was determined using image processing techniques and morphological features. The experimental data was used to evaluate the fitting of a model for cracking ratio evolution. The results showed that the VG-based shrinkage model (VG-PENG model), three fitting parameters, and two estimated parameters, well predicted the soil shrinkage characteristics in various types of soils (R2>0.97, RMSE<0.04). The Logistic model was first introduced into the expression of soil shrinkage geometry, which was previously used to describe the growth principles under limited resources. Quantification of soil shrinkage anisotropy showed that the soil shrinkage was highly anisotropic. The soil shrinkage exhibited only subsidence with shrinkage geometric factor approximately equivalent to 1 in the early phase of the soil dehydration. The shrinkage showed mainly vertical subsidence with a light horizontal shrinkage (or cracking) in the middle phase, with shrinkage geometric factor varying between 1 and 3. The shrinkage geometry factor tended to be stabilized in the late phase, indicating a residual state of shrinkage. The anisotropic shrinkage with rapid change occurred in the relative water content of 0.3-0.7. The logistic shrinkage anisotropy model well predicted the shrinkage geometric factor with respect to the water content. A new model was also proposed to predict the evolution of crack ratio with respect to water content. The curve of the model showed sigmoid characteristics, depending highly on shrinkage properties and anisotropy. The simulated data showed better agreement with the experimental one, indicating an extremely significant level (R2=0.974, P<0.001). Since the water content within the soil layer was assumed evenly distributed, this model was considered to be appropriate in a relatively limited height of the soil layer. The evolution of crack ratio was predicted from a perspective view of soil physics rather than a mechanical view. Consequently, the soil shrinkage anisotropy was fully integrated into the modelling of the cracking ratio. A significant innovation was also made to apply the VG-type shrinkage characteristic curve to crack ratio prediction. The crack porosity prediction belonged to the field of soil physics to describe the evolution of cracking ratio using the shrinkage curve and geometry factor. The proposed model well predicted the cracking ratio in surface soils with high accuracy and convenience. A further investigation was also needed to explore the efficacy of the crack ratio model on undisturbed soils, and the effects of substrate properties on cracking behaviors. The research can provide a promising theoretical basis and parameter prediction for soil water-solute movement in soils with variable-solid phase and preferential flow in soil physics and hydrology.",Wang C.; Zhang Z.; Cao D.; Chen Y.; Qi W.; Ma L.,Journal,Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering,2021-04-01,Hohai University;Nanjing Yangtze River Management Office;Development Center for Science and Technology of Rural Water Resources of Jiangsu Province,Crack porosity model ;  Cracks ;  Farmlands ;  Logistic model ;  Shrinkage characteristic curve ;  Shrinkage geometry factor ;  Soils
Achieving continuous interaction with users: An in-depth case study of Xiaomi,"User innovation has received widespread attention in academia and industry over the past four decades. However, not all users play a role in innovation. Fans, who are users who continuously interact with firms, have become new drivers of innovation and have helped firms achieve great success in practice, which has been enabled by ongoing advances in information and communication technologies. We utilize the concept of social presence as a theoretical lens and conduct a case study to explore the mechanisms through which continuous interaction is achieved to transform users into fans. The findings identify two types of fans, namely, amateur and professional fans, and their corresponding ways of achieving continuous interaction. The present work can benefit academics by contributing to research concerning fan innovation and social presence and can help practitioners by enabling more fans to participate in innovation activities.",Cui M.; Liu Y.; Qian J.,Journal,Journal of Engineering and Technology Management - JET-M,2021-04-01,Dalian University of Technology,Case study ;  Continuous interaction ;  Fan innovation ;  Social presence
Research on Multi-factorial Investment Decision of Distribution Network Based on Input-output Assessment and Genetic Algorithm,"In recent years, the construction and innovation of distribution network have been accelerating, and the overall investment in distribution network has been increasing year by year. Therefore, the investment efficiency of distribution network has become a key concern. At present, the evaluation system of distribution network often focuses on the technical aspects such as planning effect, safety and reliability, while lacks the evaluation of investment efficiency. In terms of investment decision, it usually makes a simple proportional allocation according to historical data. To solve the problems of the investment decision in distribution network construction, this paper puts forward an multi-factorial investment decision model, which is guided by the investment efficiency evaluation while satisfying the demand of distribution network. Firstly, the index system of input-output assessment, scoring function and investment benefit score evaluation model of regional distribution network are proposed. Secondly, the investment decision-making model based on genetic algorithm is proposed, which coordinate the balance between economy and safety of distribution network.

Futuristic trends and innovations for examining the performance of the course learning outcomes using rasch analytical model,"The literature on engineering education research highlights the relevance of evaluating course learning outcomes (CLOs). However, generic and reliable mechanisms for evaluating CLOs remain as challenges. The purpose of this project is to accurately evaluate the efficacy of the learning and teaching techniques through analyzing CLOs performance by using an advanced analytical model (i.e., Rasch model) in the context of engineering and business education. An association pattern between the students and the overall achieved CLO performance will be produced by this model. The sample in this project will be conducted on students who are enrolled in some nominated engineering and business courses over one academic year at Prince Sultan University, Saudi Arabia. This sample will consider several types of assessments, such as direct assessments (e.g., quizzes, assignments, projects, and examination) and indirect assessments (e.g., surveys). The current research illustrates that the Rasch Model for measurement is able to categorize grades in accordance with course expectations and standards in a more accurate manner, thus differentiating students by their extent of educational knowledge. The results from this project will guide the educator to track and monitor the CLOs’ performance, which is identified in every course to estimate the students’ knowledge, skills, and competence levels, which will be collected from the predefined sample by the end of each semester. The proposed approach with the Rasch measurement model can adequately assess the learning outcomes.",Nasralla M.; Al-Shattart B.; Almakhles D.; Abdelhadi A.; Sabry E.; García-Magariño I.,Journal,Academy of Strategic Management Journal,2021-04-01,Universidad Complutense de Madrid;Prince Sultan University,Assessment ;  Bloom Taxonomy ;  Course Learning Outcomes ;  Data Analytics ;  Education and Learning ;  Student Performance
Sparking manufacturing innovation: How temporary interplant assignments increase employee idea values,"Shop-floor employees play a key role in manufacturing innovation. In some companies, up to 75% of all productivity gains are the result of bottom-up employee ideas. In this paper, we examine how employee interplant assignments—short problem-solving jobs at other manufacturing plants within the same firm—influence employee-driven manufacturing innovation. Using unique idea-level data from a large European car parts manufacturer, we show that interplant assignments significantly increase the value of employees’ improvement ideas due to the short-term transfer of production knowledge and long-term employee learning. Both effects are amplified by assignments to plants that have high functional overlap (i.e., plants producing similar products using similar processes and machinery). One implication is that, for the purpose of employee-driven manufacturing innovation, assignments between peripheral plants with high functional overlap can be more effective than assignments to and from central plants. These findings are robust to several econometric tests. Our study provides novel and detailed empirical evidence of manufacturing innovation, and goes beyond previous research on the learning curve (learning by doing) by investigating how interplant assignments affect the value of employees’ improvement ideas (learning by moving).",Cornelius P.; Gokpinar B.; Sting F.,Journal,Management Science,2021-04-01,"Wirtschafts- und Sozialwissenschaftliche Fakultät der Universität zu Köln;UCL School of Management;Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University",Employee innovation ;  Employee mobility ;  Frontline innovation ;  Interplant assignment ;  Manufacturing innovation ;  Operational and conceptual learning

Review-The Emerging Technologies for Producing Low-Cost Titanium,"This paper presents a thorough review of various technologies to obtain titanium and its alloys and their discussion concerning their merits and demerits. Titanium and its alloys are ideal advanced structural materials because of their excellent properties such as high corrosion resistance, exceptional strength-to-weight ratio, bio-compatible, non-magnetic and mechanical properties. As a result, such materials are served extensively for several engineering applications that include wind turbines, auto industries, biomedical implants, aerospace industry, marine structures, and many others. However, the low yield and higher cost production of the current employed energy-intensive Kroll process restricts the widespread use of titanium and its alloys. Numerous alternative extraction processes have been developed during the last few decades to produce titanium and its alloys in a more accessible and cost-effective way. Amid growing demand for titanium in the market, it is necessary to consider the impact of technological innovations that can reduce titanium production cost. Recent research and developments on the electrochemical reduction method of titanium production from molten salts or ionic liquids have shown promising results. This paper reviews the developments on titanium production and its alloys by various techniques, including but not limited to molten salt electrolysis processes, such as the FFC-Cambridge process, the OS process, the USTB process, and ionic-liquid electrolysis.",Reddy R.; Shinde P.; Liu A.,Journal,Journal of the Electrochemical Society,2021-04-01,Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering,
A review on emerging efficient and stable perovskite solar cells based on g‐c3n4 nanostructures,"Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great research interest in the scientific community due to their extraordinary optoelectronic properties and the fact that their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has increased rapidly in recent years, surpassing other 3rd generation photovoltaic (PV) technologies. Graphitic carbon nitride (g‐C3N4) presents exceptional optical and electronic properties and its use was recently expanded in the field of PSCs. The addition of g‐C3N4 in the perovskite absorber and/or the electron transport layer (ETL) resulted in PCEs exceeding 22%, mainly due to defects regarding passivation, improved conductivity and crystallinity as well as low charge carriers’ recombination rate within the device. Significant performance increase, including stability enhancement, was also achieved when g‐C3N4 was applied at the PSC interfaces and the observed improvement was attributed to its wetting (hydrophobic/hydrophilic) nature and the fine tuning of the corresponding interface energetics. The current review summarizes the main innovations for the incorporation of graphitic carbon nitride in PSCs and highlights the significance and perspectives of the g‐C3N4 approach for emerging highly efficient and robust PV devices.",Gkini K.; Martinaiou I.; Falaras P.,Journal,Materials,2021-04-01,"University of Patras;National Centre for Scientific Research ""DEMOKRITOS""",Additive engineering ;  Carbon based materials ;  Efficiency ;  Graphitic carbon nitride ;  Interface engineering ;  Perovskite ;  Solar cells ;  Stability
Building information modelling and internet of things integration for facility management-literature review and future needs,"Digitisation of the built environment is seen as a significant factor for innovation in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operation sector.

Reinventing Innovation Management: The Impact of Self-Innovating Artificial Intelligence,"Through recent leaps in application, artificial intelligence (AI) has become one of the most promising digital technologies, attracting significant attention from scholars and practitioners alike. Prior innovation research has mainly focused on the opportunities for and challenges to infusing digital technologies into the innovation process. However, understanding the general effects of digital technologies is insufficient as their specific fields of application differ. AI is distinct from other digital technologies, given its potential to evolve into both a general-purpose technology and a method of inventing, and several firms are beginning to integrate AI into their innovation processes. We capture this phenomenon by introducing a concept we term self-innovating artificial intelligence (SAI), defined as the organizational utilization of AI with the aim of incrementally advancing existing or developing new products, based on insights from continuously combining and analyzing multiple data sources. As SAI is about to fundamentally change how innovations are created, this article describes the underlying AI technology; conceptualizes and outlines how firms may incorporate SAI into their innovation processes with the aim of developing increasingly complex products; and offers potential avenues for further research in this intriguing domain.",Hutchinson P.,Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2021-04-01,Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel,Artificial intelligence (AI) ;  digitization ;  inno-vation process ;  product innovation ;  self-innovating artificial intelligence (SAI)

Sustainable and green decomposition of cyanotoxins and cyanobacteria through the development of new photocatalytic materials,"Photocatalytic oxidation for the degradation of cyanobacteria (aka blue–green algae) and cyanotoxins has been extensively studied since its first application by Robertson and Lawton in 1997. Along with testing treatability of various cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins, significant advances in materials engineering have been made. Improvements on the properties of titanium dioxide and other inorganic photocatalysts include bandgap narrowing, adsorption-mediated decomposition, electron–hole recombination prevention, photocatalyst immobilization, reactor design innovation, light emitting diode usage, and/or oxidant injection, resulting in more green, sustainable, and scalable photocatalytic oxidation processes. Herein, we report not only synthesis methods, materials properties and performance, and features of photocatalysts but also transformation products, and toxicity evaluation of treatments.

Research on improvement strategies for low-carbon technology innovation based on a differential game: The perspective of tax competition,"Under China's tax reform, the central government is given legislative power to determine taxes, while tax implementation and revenue rights are vested in local governments. The actual tax rate can be controlled by local governments through factors such as the intensity of tax implementation and supervision. We argue that the distorted implementation of an environmental regulation policy caused by tax competition is an important factor affecting the effectiveness of environmental regulation, which is the main cause of uncertainty in the relationship between environmental regulation and low-carbon technology innovation through changing the strategies of local governments and enterprises under the restriction of environmental regulation. Considering the impact of tax competition, this study builds a differential game model that consists of a local government and an enterprise to investigate the equilibrium solutions under different decision-making modes and analyse the roles of income tax and a low-carbon technology innovation reward. The following key insights are obtained. (i) In addition to the direct effects of tax competition on green technology innovation through influencing the enterprise's low-carbon technology innovation effort, it has indirect effects on green technology innovation by influencing the local government's environmental governance effort under the constraint of environmental regulation. Through the effective control of income taxes and low-carbon technology innovation rewards, tax competition can help improve the strategies of local governments and enterprises. (ii) The decision-making mode with cost sharing is a kind of Pareto improvement for the regional low-carbon technology stock if the cost sharing coefficient is effectively controlled. (iii) The enterprise can be motivated by the cost sharing contract to increase its low-carbon technology innovation effort, which is conducive to improving its optimal profit. (iv) The local government cannot be motivated by the cost sharing contract, and its optimal profit can be improved only if the cost sharing coefficient is below the threshold.",Deng Y.; You D.; Zhang Y.,Journal,Sustainable Production and Consumption,2021-04-01,Hunan University of Technology and Business;Central South University,Differential game ;  Environmental regulation ;  Low-carbon technology innovation ;  Tax competition
Microgrid decision-making by public power utilities in the United States: A critical assessment of adoption and technological profiles,"The paper provides a critical review of microgrid development in the U.S., with an emphasis on the rationales for adoption and the technology configurations that are evident in large U.S. public power utilities. To do so, this study outlines specific historical and contemporary developments for the technology. It then tests deployment objectives from the literature for resonance with the adoption logic of large public power utilities that have community microgrids. Four conceptual models are identified, representing differing rationale for adoption and technology profiles. Broadly, this research finds that public power utilities with microgrid technologies have taken an incremental design approach that has not typically started with an explicit plan to island the system. In evaluating microgrid designs, the utilities leverage existing assets and respond to community priorities. The study also highlights the critical role of learning as a utility objective and as justification for technology investments. Clean/renewable policies play a more significant role than microgrid-specific policies for the public power utilities that are studied. Additionally, the study finds that two market structures factor in how microgrid deployment is shaped, namely market rules that allow users to avoid costs through load management; and market rules that facilitate the sale of energy and grid services in multilateral markets Finally, the study indicates that microgrid technology is currently reframing how distributed energy resources are conceived and interact with greater system-related value.

Development and Genetic Engineering of Hyper-Producing Microbial Strains for Improved Synthesis of Biosurfactants,"Current research energies are fixated on the synthesis of environmentally friendly and non-hazardous products, which include finding and recognizing biosurfactants that can substitute synthetic surfactants. Microbial biosurfactants are surface-active compounds synthesized intracellularly or extracellularly. To use biosurfactants in various industries, it is essential to understand scientific engagements that demonstrate its potentials as real advancement in the 21st century. Other than applying a substantial effect on the world economic market, engineered hyper-producing microbial strains in combination with optimized cultivation parameters have made it probable for many industrial companies to receive the profits of 'green' biosurfactant innovation. There needs to be an emphasis on the worldwide state of biosurfactant synthesis, expression of biosurfactant genes in expressive host systems, the recent developments, and prospects in this line of research. Thus, molecular dynamics with respect to genetic engineering of biosynthetic genes are proposed as new biotechnological tools for development, improved synthesis, and applications of biosurfactants. For example, mutant and hyper-producing recombinants have been designed efficaciously to advance the nature, quantity, and quality of biosurfactants. The fastidious and deliberate investigation will prompt a comprehension of the molecular dynamics and phenomena in new microorganisms. Throughout the decade, valuable data on the molecular genetics of biosurfactant have been produced, and this solid foundation would encourage application-oriented yields of the biosurfactant production industry and expand its utilization in diverse fields.

Strain engineering in novel α-SbP binary material with tensile-robust and compress-sensitive band structures,"Antimony phosphorus in the alpha phase (α-SbP) is a novel two-dimensional binary material with suitable band gap and environmental stability, it has attracted attention for its promising applications in the field of optoelectronics. In this work, the electronic and optical properties of α-SbP monolayer under biaxial strain have been studied by first principles calculation method based on density functional theory. It is found that when the tensile strain is applied, the band gap value of monolayer SbP increases firstly and then decreases under tensile strain, but the whole band gap value fluctuated is controlled within 0.08 eV. However, in the process of applying compressive strain, the band gap value decreases linearly with the strain value, and semiconductor-metal transition occurs at about −5% strain value. This is due to the difference in coupling between Sb and P atoms. Its optical properties under different strains are analyzed in detail, and it is found that the optical properties of SbP changed little under tensile strain, the light absorption peak is mainly concentrated in the ultraviolet region. In contrast, the compressive strain significantly adjust the optical properties of SbP. The innovation of this work is that the optoelectronic properties of SbP are studied by means of biaxial strain regulation. We find that the optoelectronic properties of SbP are robust to tensile strain. On the other hand, compressive strain has a significant effect on the photoelectric properties of SbP, and semiconductor-metal phase transition occurs. The research work in this paper provides theoretical support for the applications of monolayer α-SbP as a robust tensile and flexible compression material in optoelectronic nanodevices.",Shu Y.; Huang Z.; Liu H.; Liao Y.; Liu F.; Qi X.; Zhong J.,Journal,Physica E: Low-Dimensional Systems and Nanostructures,2021-04-01,Hunan University;Xiangtan University,Antimony phosphorus ;  First-principles calculations ;  Robust ;  Sensitive ;  Strain
Innovative virtual computational domain based on wind rose diagrams for micrositing small wind turbines,"The use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) as design tool is widespread in engineering applications, including wind engineering. The objective of this research was to implement a new scheme for wind energy evaluation by integrating CFD studies for the optimal placement of small wind turbines in an urban environment. This approach is a cost-effective method, as compared to conventional methods, to develop feasibility studies for the implementation of wind projects. Traditional CFD wind studies are performed using the prevailing wind speed, i.e., unidirectional flows. As an innovation, in this work, CFD simulations of multidirectional flows, such as those depicted by the wind roses, are proposed. This approach makes it possible to characterize the wind resource as triacontakaihexagonal prism, named the virtual computational domain (VCD). The VCD implementation enables simulations with greater representation of and fidelity to the behavior of wind in the environment, thereby making it possible to locate wind emplacements optimally. In addition, factors such as turbulence, roughness, wind speed, and direction are considered. The VCD is found to be accurate, with balance between the efficiency of computational speeds and memory requirements. The results show that VCD improved the micrositing of wind turbines, as compared with conventional CFD studies.",Arteaga-López E.; Angeles-Camacho C.,Journal,Energy,2021-04-01,Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México,Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) ;  Renewable energy ;  Small wind turbines (SWTs) ;  Urban wind energy ;  Wind energy

Social innovation: Learning from social cooperatives in the Italian context,"We contribute to the social innovation debate, integrating the social entrepreneurship and cooperative-network innovation fields, by investigating the effect of product, technological, and process innovation investments of social enterprises on social and environmental outcomes. Relying on a willingness-ability paradigm, we discuss under which circumstances social innovation unfolds. Drawing on unique survey data collected from a sample of 164 social cooperatives in Italy, we find that investments in product/service and process innovation are positively related to social innovation outcomes. Moreover, the contingent effect of proactiveness and risk-taking suggests that willingness plays a controversial effect on the relationship between innovation input and outcome. Interestingly, the contingent role of low barriers to accessing distribution channels and funding on the one hand and competitor aggressiveness on the other shows the role of ability in unfolding social innovation.

Achieving Interorganizational Ambidexterity through a Nested Entrepreneurial Ecosystem,"In this article, we examine the mechanisms through which corporations can achieve ambidexterity based on entrepreneurial ecosystems. The emergence of entrepreneurial ecosystems provides an alternative approach for large corporations to capture and cocreate value across institutional boundaries. This article explores this perspective by connecting the interorganizational ambidexterity literature with the emerging concept of entrepreneurial ecosystems through a case study. Specifically, we examine a space dedicated to collaboration with external actors initiated by a large industrial corporation in collaboration with 22 other selected organizations and start-ups stemming from the Parisian entrepreneurial ecosystem.

Industry-Academia research collaboration in software engineering: The Certus model,"Context: Research collaborations between software engineering industry and academia can provide significant benefits to both sides, including improved innovation capacity for industry, and real-world environment for motivating and validating research ideas. However, building scalable and effective research collaborations in software engineering is known to be challenging. While such challenges can be varied and many, in this paper we focus on the challenges of achieving participative knowledge creation supported by active dialog between industry and academia and continuous commitment to joint problem solving. Objective: This paper aims to understand what are the elements of a successful industry-academia collaboration that enable the culture of participative knowledge creation. Method: We conducted participant observation collecting qualitative data spanning 8 years of collaborative research between a software engineering research group on software V&V and the Norwegian IT sector. The collected data was analyzed and synthesized into a practical collaboration model, named the Certus Model. Results: The model is structured in seven phases, describing activities from setting up research projects to the exploitation of research results. As such, the Certus model advances other collaborations models from literature by delineating different phases covering the complete life cycle of participative research knowledge creation. Conclusion: The Certus model describes the elements of a research collaboration process between researchers and practitioners in software engineering, grounded on the principles of research knowledge co-creation and continuous commitment to joint problem solving. The model can be applied and tested in other contexts where it may be adapted to the local context through experimentation.",Marijan D.; Gotlieb A.,Journal,Information and Software Technology,2021-04-01,Simula Research Laboratory,Collaboration model ;  Industry-academia collaboration ;  Knowledge transfer ;  Research collaboration ;  Research exploitation ;  Research knowledge co-creation ;  Research-based innovation ;  Software engineering ;  Technology transfer
OpenTimer v2: A New Parallel Incremental Timing Analysis Engine,"Since the first release in 2015, OpenTimer v1 has been used in many industrial and academic projects for analyzing the timing of custom designs. After four-year research and developments, we have announced OpenTimer v2-a major release that efficiently supports: 1) a new task-based parallel incremental timing analysis engine to break through the performance bottleneck of existing loop-based methods; 2) a new application programming interface (API) concept to exploit high degrees of parallelisms; and 3) an enhanced support for industry-standard design formats to improve user experience. Compared with OpenTimer v1, we rearchitect v2 with a modern C++ programming language and advanced parallel computing techniques to largely improve the tool performance and usability. For a particular example, OpenTimer v2 achieved up to 5.33× speedup over v1 in incremental timing, and scaled higher with increasing cores. Our contributions include both technical innovations and engineering knowledge that are open and accessible to promote timing research in the community.",Huang T.; Guo G.; Lin C.; Wong M.,Journal,IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems,2021-04-01,The Grainger College of Engineering;John and Marcia Price College of Engineering,Computer-aided analysis ;  parallel programming

Addressing academic researcher priorities through science and technology entrepreneurship education,"A key feature of the movement to create more entrepreneurial universities is incentivizing researchers to move discoveries beyond the laboratory and into society. This places additional expectations on Ph.D. students and faculty in science and engineering disciplines, who are encouraged to explore the commercialization of their research to promote the role of universities in innovation and job creation. A major barrier to this movement is that traditional Ph.D. training does not prepare researchers to participate in entrepreneurial activity, and as such its relevance to scientific work may not be evident. In this paper, we propose a course model for science and technology entrepreneurship education that has been designed to enable academic researchers to play a more active and informed role in the commercialization of their discovery. Its curricular foundation is a set of 14 factors that address the following four priorities: (1) technology readiness and timing, (2) intellectual property pathway decisions, (3) engagement with the entrepreneurial ecosystem, and (4) personal career choices. We describe the rationale for the course, its content and outcomes.",Duval-Couetil N.; Ladisch M.; Yi S.,Journal,Journal of Technology Transfer,2021-04-01,Texas Tech University;Purdue University,Education ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Faculty ;  Graduate students ;  Research ;  Technology transfer
Orchestrating conflict in teams with the use of boundary objects and trading zones in innovation-driven engineering design projects,"While teamwork has been a central concern in engineering education, little research has systematically examined how conflict is managed in engineering teams of students. Socio-constructivism provides a solid base to explain how teamwork can foster innovation through the use of cultural artifacts, such as “boundary objects.” The purpose of this paper describing the anatomy of negotiation within several teams of engineering students located in universities of Northern California and Santiago de Chile from 2010 to 2017. We propose the concept of “conflict orchestration” to explain the dynamics of engineering teams working on innovation-driven engineering design challenges. A context sensitive qualitative research design was deployed using an ethnographic approach to the study team negotiation patterns observed in 11 teams of engineering students from Northern California and Santiago de Chile. The methodological focus was on identifying commonalities in the use of boundary objects and trading zones emerging from the students’ team interaction. Our findings illustrate two distinct strategies that the engineering teams adopted using boundary objects. We describe the use of Sticky Notes and Third Platforms. Finally, we explore students’ perceptions of the educational gain of PBL engineering design courses. The relevance of this study is threefold. First it conceptualizes a teamwork phenomenon that energizes innovation through scaffolded conflict. We also explore how this concept is enacted by engineering teams in two different cultural sites. Finally, we provide bottom-up strategies that can be implemented in other undergraduate engineering design programs.",Miranda C.; Goñi J.; Hilliger I.,Journal,International Journal of Technology and Design Education,2021-04-01,Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile,Conflict orchestration ;  Engineering design ;  Socio-constructivism ;  Teams

How to develop research skills among undergraduate engineering students to tackle current ongoing topics? A Smart-Grid case study,"The Smart-Grid approach, as a paramount worldwide issue, is a paradigm shift from the traditional way energy is produced, distributed, and used. It implies a complex multidisciplinary panorama which includes ongoing subjects for which traditional electrical and computer engineers are not entirely ready. As the implementation of Smart-Grid is imminent, high-skilled professionals are needed to absorb the research, labor, business, logistics, and innovation issues of today and tomorrow. This leads to a transformation of the education role for undergraduate programs which is now, accordingly, urged to build up students’ research skills. In this paper, a case study is presented to introduce and asses a new teaching/evaluation methodology intended to build critical thinking, objectivity, and ingenuity among mechanical–electrical undergraduate students during a one-semester course on Smart-Grid. The results show that the proposed technique may improve the aforementioned research skills within the group of students. Overall, the proposed methodology can be used as a protocol to guide new research cases and to frame similar educational proposals.",Ponce P.; Ibarra L.; Mata O.; Molina A.,Journal,International Journal of Electrical Engineering and Education,2021-04-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,peer-review ;  Research skills ;  Smart-Grid ;  undergraduate

Research on concrete construction technology and innovation management in civil construction,"With the continuous progress of society, the continuous development of economy and the acceleration of urbanization, the construction industry has also developed vigorously. In the civil building foundation structure, it is inseparable from the use of mass concrete. Only by ensuring that the structural strength, crack resistance and bearing capacity of mass concrete meet the requirements, can we improve the quality of civil engineering buildings. The construction technology of mass concrete structure in civil engineering buildings is analyzed. The society has put forward more and more stringent requirements for the construction technology of civil engineering, and civil engineering construction technology is the core technology in engineering construction. In recent years, although civil engineering construction technology has developed rapidly and achieved certain achievements and results, most of the technologies are imported or referenced by western technologies, which are lack of innovation, and some of them are relatively backward, wasting a lot of manpower, material and financial resources, resulting in waste of resources, unqualified construction quality and other phenomena. Therefore, in order to better apply civil engineering and improve its construction effect and quality, it is necessary to innovate the construction technology. In the actual construction process, it is necessary to innovate the civil engineering construction technology, so that the engineering construction industry can improve productivity and meet the needs of the development of social construction.

Primacy of ecological engineering tools for combating eutrophication: An ecohydrological assessment pathway,"Eutrophication of freshwater bodies causes loss of earth's biological resources and aggravates climate change, thus assuming major environmental concern. Both endogenous and exogenous nutrient enrichment are responsible for eutrophication. Numerous monitoring and management studies conducted worldwide have resulted high-level technological innovations. These studies cumulatively uphold the significance of ecohydrological and ecological engineering approaches. However, holistic and insightful reviews with feasible recommendations of such huge academic outputs are rather scanty. Therefore, our main objective was to introduce a new perspective of eutrophication as an ecohydrological component; to discover all possibilities of monitoring and restoration of eutrophic water bodies. Furthermore, the present study critically analyzes various methods of treatment of eutrophication (physical, biological, chemical, and eco-engineering). Comprehensive volume of literature has been surveyed using search engines like Scopus, Google Scholar, PubMed, ScienceDirect etc. Meaningful keywords were used to obtain reliable information on methods of ecohydrological assessment in relation to eutrophication of freshwater bodies. According to our survey, ecohydrological research is diversified into conceptual knowledge (37.2%), assessment (32.6%), climate change (9.3%), algae/cyanotoxins (7%), engineering and restoration (7%), modelling (4.6%) and biodiversity (2.3%), in the instant decade (2010–2020). We have identified a clear trend of transition of restoration methods from traditional towards modern techniques over time.

Fun is serious business: Digital natives and digital technologies in construction education,"Digital technologies are becoming increasingly wide-spread not just in our personal but also in our professional lives. Younger generations, born into a world of vast technological advances and innovations, are constantly connected expecting immediate response. Despite the relatively later adoption of digital technology in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry, it has now become a permanent part of its successful operation with one such example being Building Information Modelling (BIM). This study employed a survey research approach to investigate how digital natives cope with the use of digital construction technologies in an education context. The findings suggest that the students on the course prefer mobile devices over desktop computers, stay connected continuously by using a wide variety of social media applications, learn new construction-specific freeware intuitively and by experimenting rather than following step-by-step instructions, and especially value the use of diverse specialist software to aid their learning. These findings could have potential implications for the future design of learning spaces, the way connectivity is considered in delivery and assessment, and the continual upskilling of the older generation faculty to address the constantly evolving learning preferences of the digital natives.",Kiroff L.; Puolitaival T.,Journal,Journal of Higher Education Theory and Practice,2021-03-23,UNITEC Institute of Technology,"Construction education, construction-specific freeware ;  Digital natives ;  Digital technologies"
Using Biochemistry Song to Assist Biochemistry Teaching,Biochemistry is a science that takes the organism as the research object and studies the essence of life chemistry. It is the core course in the field of life science. For a long time‚ the biochemistry course has been featured with many vital points‚ more comprehensive range‚ and abstract content‚ which suppresses students' interest and leads to their low enthusiasm in the learning process. In the past two decades‚ biochemistry teaching abroad has achieved a great achievement when combining science‚ technology‚ engineering‚ mathematics and art (STEM + Arts)‚ especially music. According to the above situation and the practical biochemistry teaching‚ the author tries to apply biochemistry songs to assist the process of classroom teaching. They can transform abstract and obscure biochemistry knowledge into melodies. They can also stimulate students' interest in learning‚ activate the classroom atmosphere‚ and make students fall in love with biochemistry during the teaching process. While creating biochemical songs‚ students can promote their thinking and innovation‚ cultivate the divergent mind‚ evaluate key and difficult points‚ and visualize some profound ideas. In learning‚ biochemistry songs are used to show the charm of biochemistry‚ which makes it into an exciting subject and makes students interested learners. This paper describes the development and growth of biochemical songs in China. Combined with specific examples‚ it reviews biochemical songs' application in assisting biochemistry teaching from three aspects: introduce teaching topic‚ deep understanding of content‚ and intimately connect to life. It also discusses issues such as adapting lyrics‚ choosing melody‚ spreading songs‚ and designing a teaching plan.,Li Y.; Liu H.; Yang R.,Journal,Chinese Journal of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,2021-03-22,Binzhou University;Nanjing University,assist teaching ;  biochemistry ;  songs ;  teaching methods
Big data in multi-decision making system of the aerospace industry,"Big data describes streams of data that are huge by volume and rapid generation. It is practically difficult to collect data streams of any application that has information in yottabyte such as E-commerce, Healthcare, Industries, Stock markets, Entertainment and Aeronautics. Data streams are gathered from various offline and real time values which are in different formats and complex structures. Big data analytics contributes colossal benefits in digitization of decision making processes that belong to real time application. Airline industries comprising both commercial and engineering operations that have complexity with its technological and business operations claim multi-value decision making system. The decision making processes involved in prediction based processes on various complex structures of airline industries like forecasting weather condition to travel, identification of threshold fuel quantity while aircraft fly, locating the airport for landing of aircraft, flight in-sight operations, etc. However, the existing data streams are collected from online and offline raw data stored in cloud database. These information are analysed on multi-dimensional value based input fed into Artificial Intelligence (AI) that are implemented with Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to derive a quantitative and qualitative decisions on real-time airline process with fewer interference of the human intelligence. Artificial intelligence empowers airlines to analyze precisely about their actual operations. For example, flight holdings can be automatically detected and their associated fuel consumption automatically tracked. In other words, AI is able to provide the fuel cost of holdings, and easily, for each operated airport. AI taken data from cloud as multi-dimensional input to implement human intellectual technologies so that innovations and control in airline operations could be done with powerful design techniques and intelligent decision making structures. While AI gathers its high valuable information, the both Internet of Things (IoT) and big data support tremendously through wired and wireless communication. Thus, we have introduced various kinds of decision making operations such as forecasting weather conditions, optimizing fuel cost, adjusting the speed while flying, evolution in engine design and performance, etc. involved in airline industries. Also, we discuss the importance of big data and its analytical method while taking the decisions based on multiple real time parameters with complex structures. Also we introduce how the data analytics and decision making system will be helpful in future research in Next Generation's (NextGen's) aeronautical system.",Kalaichelvi P.; AKila V.; Rani T.; Sowmiya S.; Divya C.,Book,A Closer Look at Big Data Analytics,2021-03-19,"Sri Sairam Engineering College, Chennai;Gokaraju Rangaraju Institute of Engineering & Technology",AI ;  Big data ;  Cloud ;  Data analytics ;  Multidimensional parameters ;  NextGen

Agile principles in automotive software development: Analysis of potential levers,"Cars are becoming software-defined products and mobility is in a transition to become a digital network business. This leads to a high pressure on automotive software developers to deliver more and more complex software in ever faster innovation cycles. The classical development process of a car is a holistic and complex systems engineering approach which delivers a fully developed car (mechanics, electrics, electronics and software) after several years of development. This car will be produced (without major changes) for many years. The automotive industry mainly applies the V-model, a complex and much elaborated development process which systematically leads from a comprehensive set of requirements to a car which exactly fits the requirements. Very much different from this, agile development methodology starts with very fuzzy and uncertain requirements and drives the development via incremental improvements with close customer integration towards a product which might deviate a lot from the initial idea. For a number of reasons, this purely agile approach is not possible for automotive development. Therefore, ongoing research is conducted on integrating agile methods into the V-model - an approach which isn't foreseen by the Agile Manifesto. Nevertheless, substantial progress is made and the automotive industry put big hopes into this approach. This contribution identifies four promising approaches for the integration of agile methods and principles into V-model. The approaches are analysed based on a literature review. A first set of hypotheses about the possible improvement and leverage for the automotive software development is developed. The hypotheses are tested in an early validation step with industry experts in order to support the design of experiments and surveys for further research.",Anjum S.; Wolff C.,Conference Proceeding,"2021 IEEE European Technology and Engineering Management Summit, E-TEMS 2021 - Conference Proceedings",2021-03-18,Fachhochschule Dortmund,Agile methods ;  Automotive software development ;  Customer collaboration ;  Iterative development ;  Requirements

"Open innovation and IP management in medical devices: A review on scope, drivers and barriers","Innovation plays a vital role in companies' for the long sustainability and also to thrive in competitive environment. Industries which are competing to innovate require high degree of technological skills to thrive. Open Innovation is the concept of resources sharing and utilization among organizations and across industry. It has brought in a significant change across all sectors in industries and research organizations. Especially, in India, the Medical devices manufacturing industry is at the booming stage, where they need to focus on high accuracy and zero defects since the procedures and usage of devices should be safe and reliable. The importance of open innovation in medical devices is unavoidable, though this concept is new and challenging. To ensure that your new product is protected from intentional or unintentional IP infringement or reverse engineering & for being the first one to market, the stake holders who are taking part in open innovation has to strive to expand the gap between your medical product and similar ones that may follow. Hence the biggest challenge in open innovation is to get the patent right or Intellectual Property (IP) because of the participation of more parties & stake holders. In India, generally the procedure for grant of patent is time consuming and a complicated process. This paper reviews the scope of open innovation in medical device industry, medical device industry in India, need of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and Intellectual Property (IP) management in medical devices, and factors which act as drivers and barriers for open innovation in the medical device industry.",Rajan R.; Bhasi A.,Journal,Trends in Biomaterials and Artificial Organs,2021-03-15,"Cochin University of Science and Technology, School of Engineering",Barriers ;  Drivers ;  Innovation ;  Intelluctual property management ;  Intelluctual property rights ;  Medical devices
Closing the chasm between virtual and physical delivery for innovative learning spaces using learning analytics,"Purpose: One of the misconceptions of teaching and learning for practical-based programmes, such as engineering, sciences, architecture, design and arts, is the necessity to deliver via face-to-face physical modality. This paper refutes this claim by providing case studies of best practices in delivering such courses and their hands-on skillsets using completely online virtual delivery that utilises different formats of 2D and 3D media and tools, supported by evidence of efficiency using learning analytics. Design/methodology/approach: The case studies were designed using pedagogical principles of constructivism and deep learning, conducted within a mixture of 2D and 3D virtual learning environments with flexible interface and tools capabilities. State-of-the-art coding and scripting techniques were also used to automate different student tasks and increase engagement. Regression and descriptive analysis methods were used for Learning Analytics. Findings: Learning analytics of all case studies demonstrated the capability to achieve course/project learning outcomes, with high engagement from students amongst peers and with tutors. Furthermore, the diverse virtual learning tools used, allowed students to display creativity and innovation efficiently analogous to physical learning. Originality/value: The synthesis of utilised media and tools within this study displays innovation and originality in combining different technology techniques to achieve an effectual learning experience. That would usually necessitate face-to-face, hands-on physical contact to perform practical tasks and receive feedback on them. Furthermore, this paper provides suggestions for future research using more advanced technologies.",Saleeb N.,Journal,International Journal of Information and Learning Technology,2021-03-15,Middlesex University,3D virtual learning environments ;  Application integration ;  Artificial intelligence pedagogy tools ;  Audio video communication ;  Constructivism ;  Deep learning methods ;  Descriptive analysis ;  Distance learning ;  Educational collaboration platforms ;  Effectual learning experience ;  Innovative teaching techniques ;  Learning analytics ;  Learning management system ;  Online learning spaces ;  Regression
Effect of green technology innovation on green total factor productivity in China: Evidence from spatial durbin model analysis,"Green technology innovation can greatly decline the environmental effects arising from fossil energy consumption. It is an essential way to improve green total factor productivity (GTFP) and achieve China's goal of sustainable development. In this paper, stochastic frontier analysis and Malmquist index methods are applied to estimate provincial GTFPs of China during 2000–2016. Then, Spatial Durbin model is used to find out their spatial effect of green technology innovation on green total factor productivity from regional perspective. Empirical results are as follows: Firstly, it shows an upward trend on the whole while GTFP of eastern region is the highest and that of western region is the lowest. Moran index of GTFPs varies such dynamic trends as ‘upward→downward→upward’. Moreover, it is significantly positive and still at the lower-level range. ‘High-High’ and ‘Low-Low’ are the dominant spatial clustering types. This indicates that more attention should be paid to spatial arrangements. Secondly, based on the analysis results of Spatial Durbin model, green technology innovation has significant positive effect on its own GTFP variation but negative effects on that of its neighbors during the research period. Thirdly, based on three subsamples results, green technology innovations of eastern and central regions have negative effects on their GTFPs while having positive effects on that of western provinces. Findings can provide spatial references for central government in the policy regarding accelerating high-quality green development.",Wang H.; Cui H.; Zhao Q.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2021-03-15,North China Electric Power University (Baoding),Green technology innovation ;  High-quality development ;  Spatial durbin model
Research on green innovation effect of industrial agglomeration from perspective of environmental regulation: Evidence in China,"Innovation has been valued as a main driving force of social development, and the need for environmental protection has further raised green innovation development. Previous studies have confirmed that industrial agglomeration has an innovation spillover effect, and furthermore it varies with different agglomeration modes. However, the addition of environmental regulation could exert effects on the innovation spillover of industrial agglomeration. Based on Chinese provincial panel data from 2003 to 2017, this paper tested the effect of different agglomeration modes on green technology innovation (green process innovation and green product innovation) under environmental regulation. Research found that: when industrial agglomeration promotes green technology innovation, environmental regulation will inhibit agglomeration innovation; when industrial agglomeration hinders green technology innovation, environmental planning will promote agglomeration innovation. The regional difference of cluster development are obvious in China, and the effect of agglomeration innovation in different regions is also different. In the implementation of environmental regulation for each region, it is necessary to combine the current situation of cluster development to effectively promote green technology innovation.",Li X.; Lai X.; Zhang F.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2021-03-15,South China Normal University,Diversified agglomeration ;  Environmental regulation ;  Green technology innovation ;  Specialized agglomeration

Optical processes in carbon nanocolloids,"Light is the original source of most energy on Earth, allowing us to see and live. It is also central to many technological processes. Therefore, innovative nanomaterials that can absorb, generate, or further exploit light are of utmost importance, having the potential to become pervasive in our lives. This is the case for carbon nanocolloids, which are ubiquitous, biocompatible, and inexpensive, which are the three important prerequisites for their broader application in different fields of technology. Yet, despite intense research for a number of years, a unifying picture describing the excited-state properties of these nanocolloids is lacking. It is possibly the time when this approach should be reversed, embracing the inherent diversity of excited states in carbon-based particles, which enable us to focus on engineering their optical properties based on their structural variability. A deeper understanding of the molecular features of carbon nanocolloids is emerging as one of the key factors, which will allow unlocking excited-state processes appearing out of reach, unfolding the full potential of optical processes in this potent family of nanomaterials.",Ragazzon G.; Cadranel A.; Ushakova E.; Wang Y.; Guldi D.; Rogach A.; Kotov N.; Prato M.,Journal,Chem,2021-03-11,"CIC biomaGUNE;Ikerbasque, Basque Foundation for Science;Saint Petersburg National Research University of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics University ITMO;University of Michigan, Ann Arbor;Università degli Studi di Trieste;City University of Hong Kong;Instituto de Química Física de los Materiales, Medio Ambiente y Energía;Universidad de Buenos Aires;Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg","carbon dots ;  carbon nanocolloids ;  carbon nanoparticles ;  charge transfer ;  energy transfer ;  fluorescence ;  SDG7: Affordable and clean energy ;  SDG9: Industry, innovation, and infrastructure"
Research Progress of Bentonite Modified Cementitious Materials,"There are many deficiencies in production, construction and performance of cement, lime and other traditional cementitious materials. Large energy consumption and high cost of production cause environmental pressure. It is easy to bleed and segregate during the construction, cracks are easy to occur after hardening, and the moisture absorption and thermal insulation are poor. Bentonite is a kind of common industrial clay, which belongs to natural pozzolanic material. Due to its unique mineral structure and crystalline chemical properties, it has cation exchange, expansibility, thixotropy, stability, plasticity, cohesiveness, adsorption, and dispersion. Bentonite is widely used in civil engineering, geotechnical engineering, water conservancy engineering, mine filling and other fields as modified cement, lime and other cementitious materials. However, due to bentonite has a variety of superior properties, the existing research only focuses on one kind of properties of bentonite. The research scope is wide and the results vary widely, and its regularity has not been summarized. At present, the research on bentonite modified cementitious materials at home and abroad mainly focuses on: (1) modifying natural bentonite itself to expand the use of bentonite; (2) using bentonite as supplementary cementitious material after heat treatment mix in the production of cement; (3) mixing bentonite into various cementitious materials mortar and concrete. In the condensate, the working performance, durable performance, and mechanical properties of mortar and concrete are improved; (4) mixing bentonite with related cementitious materials to prepare functional building materials with good properties, such as ceramsite and other sintering materials, phase change heat preservation materials, adsorption and solidification of heavy metal materials. In order to clarify the research status of bentonite modified cementitious materials. This review offers a retrospection of the research efforts concerning the bentonite modified cementitious materials, and provides elaborate descriptions about the pozzolanic activity of bentonite, the properties and mechanism of bentonite modified cementitious materials, and the application of bentonite modified cementitious materials. We then pay attention to the problems confronting the current state-of-the-art bentonite modified cementitious materials and look forward to its future. We have confidence that the bentonite has a bright future in the development and innovation of excellent properties and environmental-friendly cementitious materials.",Liu Y.; Su Y.; Yin Y.; Zhao J.; Wang S.; Mo Z.,Journal,Cailiao Daobao/Materials Reports,2021-03-10,North China University of Science and Technology;North China Institute of Aerospace Engineering;Xi'an Jiaotong University,Bentonite ;  Cementitious materials ;  Phase change material ;  Plastic concrete ;  Pozzolanic activity

Research on the Innovation Radiation of Shanghai Science and Technology Innovation Center to the Yangtze River Delta,"By constructing a regional innovation capability evaluation index system, comprehensively measuring the innovation capabilities of cities in the Yangtze River Delta region, and using the modified gravity model to construct the basic spatial radiation framework for innovation in the Yangtze River Delta region, it is important for Shanghai Science and Technology Innovation Center and 26 core cities in the Yangtze River Delta region. The innovative radiation intensity was measured and analyzed, and further visualized analysis was made with the help of ArcGIS10.5 software. The results show that Shanghai Science and Technology Innovation Center is at the core of the innovation spatial structure of the Yangtze River Delta, but the scope of innovation radiation is relatively small; the spatial distribution of urban innovation in the Yangtze River Delta region is obviously unbalanced; the innovation environment is in the development of urban innovation. The role is increasingly obvious.

Intelligent Energy - Cognitive AI to Augment the Human Knowledge,"Andrew Grove (founder CEO Intel) defines strategic inflection points as what happens to a business when a major event alters its fundamentals. The Covid-19 pandemic is one such historic event that is changing fundamental business assumptions in the Oil industry. Companies with a hunter-gatherer mindset will ride this wave with the help of technologies that make their operations lean and efficient. Current developments in AI, specifically around Cognitive Sciences is one such area that will empower the early adopters to a many-fold improvement in engineering and research productivity. This paper explores 'how to augment the human intelligence with insights from engineering literature, leveraging Cognitive AI techniques?'. The key challenge of acquiring knowledge from engineering literature (patents, books, journals, articles, papers etc.) is the sheer volume at which it grows annually (100s of millions existing and new papers growing at 40% year-on-year as per IDC). 6 million+ patents are filed every year, of which a mere 20-40% are relevant to any technology domain. It is humanely impossible to scour, review and take the right decisions by reading them all. This paper describes key cognitive techniques like concept extraction, cause-effect formulation, sentiment analysis, document summarization, topic modeling, automatic metadata extraction etc., that conforms to the analytical methodology used by E&P researchers worldwide. Such techniques can also be applied to legacy internal data of energy companies, empowering digitalization and knowledge management initiatives. Cognitive techniques have been around for a while now (first generic patents from IBM in early 1990s) but have never been applied to the engineering world, until the 2010s when IHS Markit (under entity Invention Machine Corp.) patented and productized this as an engineering research, problem solving and innovation platform. This paper also explores the efficiency gains and values accrued by the researcher community, while using IHS Markit's Cognitive AI platform.",Ghosh A.,Conference Proceeding,SAE Technical Papers,2021-03-08,,

Comparative research of patent citations of patent applicants and patent examiners: A case study in the field of 5G communication technologies,"[Purpose/Significance] The research and application of patent citation data analysis are very extensive, which has important significance to understand the industry evolution and find opportunities for emerging technologies. The research is based on an in-depth understanding of factors such as citation motivation and actual function. [Method/Process] From the subject research perspective, this paper used the highly cited patents in the 5G communication engineering from the patent database (Derwent Innovations Index, DII), as the object, and downloaded the patent datasets of the citations of the patent examiners and the patent applicants. We revealed the attribute characteristics of two types of citations and the hidden value through the comparative analysis of the different citation datasets and observed the certain similarities and differences in two types of citations datasets in the publishing time, quotation of references, and the concentration field of technologies through social network analysis. [Results/Conclusions] The empirical conclusion shows that the examiner dataset tends to cite mature patents published earlier, and the examiner dataset has a higher concentration in both citation type and IPC. The analysis shows that most patents in the 5G field tend to apply the international applications, and the United States, China, and Europe are the important areas for the deployment of 5G technologies. The patentees or institutions of the applicant dataset are mostly small and medium-sized companies or research institutes engaged in the communication industry, while the citation examiners are relatively concentrated in large, established multinational communication equipment companies. Besides, examiners are more likely to refer to patents with a higher number of partners. In terms of the patent technology content, the applicant citations focus on the research and development of communication equipment and devices, as well as the research of communication protocols and technical methods, while the examiner citations focus on the technical research of communication methods and transmission.",Wu Q.; Zhao S.,Journal,Journal of Library and Information Science in Agriculture,2021-03-05,Guangdong University of Finance;Jilin University,5G ;  Citation motivation ;  Patent analysis ;  Patent examiner
Teaching Solar and Wind Energy Conversion Course for Engineering Students: A Novel Approach,"Solar and Wind Energy Conversion (SWEC) course has evolved as an important core course in the curriculum of the B.Tech (Electrical and Electronics Engineering) programme, the evaluation of which is done in a conventional way using written exams. There is a need for better evaluation methods in order to help students develop deeper comprehension of topics and associated practical skills. This paper discusses the implementation of some innovative assessment methods towards this objective. A total of 43 students of final year Electrical and Electronics Engineering registered for the SWEC course whose performance is evaluated through open book test, quiz, research article based evaluation and experiment-based learning besides the sessional examination. The open book test comprised of questions to analyze the real time data/case study, while the quizzes are designed to be not straight forward, requiring critical thinking to answer the fundamental principles of the course. Since wind and solar energy are active research areas and also to inculcate research aptitude in students, the assessment scheme of ""Research Article based Evaluation""has been used. Students were also exposed to specifically designed experiments in this course in order to give hands-on training to appreciate the concepts better. The application of basic principles was tested through the internal assessment exam. The course end survey through student feedback indicates high level of satisfaction. Most of the students gained confidence in practical skills and critical analysis skills through the various assessment methods adopted. By experiment based learning, the students can realize their own level of potential and it increases the capability of the students to face challenges that they normally meet in the real time work environment. It is recommended to explore further innovative assessment methods such as project based learning or involvement of industry personnel to evaluate this course in order to add value to the learning experience of students.",Rajesh K.; Sivapragasam C.; Rajendran S.,Conference Proceeding,"2021 International Conference on Advance Computing and Innovative Technologies in Engineering, ICACITE 2021",2021-03-04,Kalasalingam Academy of Research and Education,Bloom's Taxonomy ;  Course Outcomes ;  Innovations in learning ;  Solar and Wind Energy Conversion ;  Students feedback

Futuristic trends and innovations for examining the performance of course learning outcomes using the rasch analytical model,"The literature on engineering education research highlights the relevance of evaluating course learning outcomes (CLOs). However, generic and reliable mechanisms for evaluating CLOs remain challenges. The purpose of this project was to accurately assess the efficacy of the learning and teaching techniques through analysing the CLOs’ performance by using an advanced analytical model (i.e., the Rasch model) in the context of engineering and business education. This model produced an association pattern between the students and the overall achieved CLO performance. The sample in this project comprised students who are enrolled in some nominated engineering and business courses over one academic year at Prince Sultan University, Saudi Arabia. This sample considered several types of assessment, such as direct assessments (e.g., quizzes, assignments, projects, and examination) and indirect assessments (e.g., surveys). The current research illustrates that the Rasch model for measurement can categorise grades according to course expectations and standards in a more accurate manner, thus differentiating students by their extent of educational knowledge. The results from this project will guide the educator to track and monitor the CLOs’ performance, which is identified in every course to estimate the students’ knowledge, skills, and competence levels, which will be collected from the predefined sample by the end of each semester. The Rasch measurement model’s proposed approach can adequately assess the learning outcomes.",Nasralla M.; Al-Shattarat B.; Almakhles D.; Abdelhadi A.; Abowardah E.,Journal,Electronics (Switzerland),2021-03-02,Prince Sultan University,Assessment ;  Bloom taxonomy ;  Course learning outcomes ;  Data analytics ;  Education and learning ;  Student performance

Criteria that guide the professor's practice to explain mathematics at basic sciences courses in engineering degrees in peru: A case study,"Background: Research on mathematics teaching in basic science classes within Peruvian engineering degrees was required prior to the identification of alternatives to improve the training of future engineers. Objective: To identify the criteria that guide the practice of professors in Peru when explaining mathematics in basic science classes within engineering degrees, with specific reference to derivatives. Design: Qualitative case-study research that seeks to understand current mathematics teaching through an analysis of and reflection on the participants' practices. Setting and participants: Professors who give classes within engineering faculties in Lima. One of these was selected as a case study. Data collection and analysis: The classes taught by these professors were filmed and the criteria they follow in the design and implementation of their classes were inferred by means of the didactic suitability criteria, which were also used to design a questionnaire to interview the teachers; triangulation was then performed between their words and their actions. Results: This professor was guided by ecological criteria (syllabus and profession) and mediational criteria (time available for classes), although he felt that his practice was based primarily on cognitive criteria (previous knowledge) and ecological criteria (future profession). Conclusion: The criteria that guided his practice help explain why basic science classes within engineering degrees are taught with a lecture-based and procedural approach, and why innovations are not included.",Garcés W.; Font V.; Morales-Maure L.,Journal,Acta Scientiae,2021-03-01,Universidad de Panamá;Universitat de Barcelona,Derivatives ;  Didactic suitability criteria ;  Engineering ;  Mathematics teaching ;  Reflection on practice
Deconstruction of idea generation methods into a framework of creativity mechanisms,"Creative ideas are a central part of design thinking, whether solving engineering problems, generating interesting art, as well as developing successful products and innovations. Idea generation methods are a well-researched topic, and there is significant research that focuses on specific idea generation methods and how they perform. Furthermore, several method classifications have been suggested to help understand the cognitive mechanisms involved in creative ideation as well as differences between methods. Yet, the discourse is usually on which ideation method outperforms another or how to improve an ideation method rather than the elements, rules, constraints, and activities that comprise ideation methods. In this study, 88 well-documented idea generation methods are reviewed and analyzed. We find all analyzed methods consist of 25 basic mechanisms. The mechanisms are discussed and classified into idea promoting and implementation mechanisms. We suggest that rather than focusing research only on methods, there should be a parallel track of research on these mechanisms and their interactions to help increase our understanding of creativity methods, add understanding for practitioners on how to get the best advantages out of creativity methods, and finally improve the way that practical creativity is approached in education.",Kirjavainen S.; Holttä-Otto K.,Journal,Journal of Mechanical Design,2021-03-01,Aalto University,Creativity and concept generation ;  Design methodology ;  Design theory ;  Methodology
Challenges and innovations in osteochondral regeneration: Insights from biology and inputs from bioengineering toward the optimization of tissue engineering strategies,"Due to the extremely high incidence of lesions and diseases in aging population, it is critical to put all efforts into developing a successful implant for osteochondral tissue regeneration. Many of the patients undergoing surgery present osteochondral fissure extending until the subchondral bone (corresponding to a IV grade according to the conventional radiographic classification by Berndt and Harty). Therefore, strategies for functional tissue regeneration should also aim at healing the subchondral bone and joint interface, besides hyaline cartilage. With the ambition of contributing to solving this problem, several research groups have been working intensively on the development of tailored implants that could promote that complex osteochondral regeneration. These implants may be manufactured through a wide variety of processes and use a wide variety of (bio)materials. This review aimed to examine the state of the art regarding the challenges, advantages, and drawbacks of the current strategies for osteochondral regeneration. One of the most promising approaches relies on the principles of additive manufacturing, where technologies are used that allow for the production of complex 3D structures with a high level of control, intended and predefined geometry, size, and interconnected pores, in a reproducible way. However, not all materials are suitable for these processes, and their features should be examined, targeting a successful regeneration.",Morouço P.; Fernandes C.; Lattanzi W.,Journal,Journal of Functional Biomaterials,2021-03-01,"Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Campus di Roma;Polytechnic Institute of Leiria",Additive manufacturing ;  Biomate-rials ;  Hyaline cartilage ;  Regenerative medicine ;  Subchondral bone ;  Tissue engineering

Macro patterns and trends of U.S. consumer technological innovation diffusion rates,"Macro-level trends and patterns are commonly used in business, science, finance, and engineering to provide insights and estimates to assist decision-makers. In this research effort, macro-level trends and patterns were explored on the diffusion rates of technological innovations, a component of a sorely under-studied question in technology assessment: When should a technological innovation be abandoned? A quantitative exploratory data analysis (EDA)-based approach was employed to examine diffusion market data of 42 U.S. consumer technological innovations from the early 1900s to the 2010s to extract general macro-level knowledge on technological innovation diffusion rates. A goal of this effort is to grow diffusion rate knowledge to enable the development of general macro-based forecasting tools. Such tools would aid decision-makers in making informed and proactive decisions on when to abandon a technological innovation. This research offers sev-eral significant contributions to the macro-level understanding of the boundaries and likelihood of achieving a range of technological innovation diffusion rates.

The development of efficient contaminated polymer materials shredding in recycling processes,"Recently, a dynamic increase in the number of polymer elements ending their life cycle has been observed. There are three main ways of dealing with polymer waste: reuse in an un-changed form, recycling (both material and energy), and disposal (mainly in the form of landfilling or incineration). The legislation of European countries promotes in particular two forms of waste management: reuse and recycling. Recycling processes are used to recover materials and energy especially from contaminated waste, which are structurally changed by other materials, friction, temperature, machine, process, etc. The recycling of polymers, especially of multi-plastic structural elements, requires the use of special technological installations and a series of preparatory opera-tions, including crushing and separating. Due to the universality and necessity of materials processing in recycling engineering, in particular size reduction, the aim of this study is to organize and systematize knowledge about shredding in the recycling process of end-of-life polymeric materials. This could help properly design these processes in the context of sustainable development and circular economy. Firstly, an overview of the possibilities of end-of-life plastics management was made, and the meaning of shredding in the end-of-life pathways was described. Then, the development of comminution in recycling processes was presented, with special emphasis given to quasi-cutting as the dominant mode of comminution of polymeric materials. The phenomenon of quasi-cutting, as well as factors related to the material, the operation of the shredding machine, and the technological process affecting it were described. Research conducted on quasi-cutting as a phenomenon when cutting single material samples and quasi-cutting as a machine process was char-acterized. Then, issues regarding recycling potentials in the context of shredding were systematized. Considerations included the areas of material, technical, energy, human, and control potentials. Presented bases and models can be used to support the innovation of creative activities, i.e., environmentally friendly actions, that produce specific positive environmental results in the mechanical processing of recycled and reused materials. The literature survey indicates the need to explore the environmental aspect of the shredding process in recycling and connect the shredding process var-iables with environmental consequences. This will help to design and control the processes to get the lowest possible environmental burdens.",Flizikowski J.; Kruszelnicka W.; Macko M.,Journal,Polymers,2021-03-01,Kazimierz Wielki University in Bydgoszcz;Bydgoszcz University of Science and Technology,Contaminated polymeric materials ;  Mechanical recycling ;  Shredding
Research on the evolution of textile technological convergence in china,"Technological convergence (TC) plays a vital role in leading the next generation of technological innovation. Research in this field has practical significance for its ongoing deployment as an innovation-driven strategy in the sustainable development of the textile industry. However, there are few relevant studies, with most of them carried out on only one level, whether from a micro or macro perspective. This study analyses the evolution of TC from both macro (industry) and micro (technical field) levels. A patented co-occurrence method is employed to measure TC and various social network indicators, including density, node strength and the Jaccard coefficient, to measure the evolution of the network and its nodes and edges. The results present that the density of the macro TC network has been increasing and that the industrial technologies that are closely associated with the textile industry include chemical engineering technology, pharmaceutical technology and material technology. Meanwhile, the micro TC network manifests high dependence on proprietary technology, whilst the convergence degree between the core technologies is relatively high. This study proposes that the government should continue to encourage textile enterprises to strengthen TC, particularly their integration with leading technologies, and should strengthen the integration of emerging industrial textiles with national defence, medicine and other related fields to improve innovation speed.",Xu Q.; Cheng H.,Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2021-03-01,Zhejiang Sci-Tech University;China Jiliang University,Co-classification analysis ;  Pattern evolution ;  Technical classification standard ;  Technological convergence
Modeling a logistics hub using the digital footprint method—the implication for open innovation engineering,"Optimizing the cargo flows through the nodes of a digital transport corridor is a crucial problem; solving it allows to introduce modern management methods in logistics. This study examines the optimization of the technology of a distribution center as the base node of a third-party logistics network operator. Our objective consisted in theoretically substantiating the application of mathematical formalisms to describing the passage of stochastic goods flows of a complex structure through a node of a logistics network. To solve the problem, we constructed a mathematical model intended as a decision-making block in the Warehouse Management System software. This paper presents the results of calculations carried out using a computer according to the proposed algorithm. Preliminary results allow to conclude that there is a significant resource for reducing construction and maintenance costs of the distribution center. Quantitatively, the savings will range from 10% to 40%, depending on the terms of delivery of goods and the degree of market uncertainty. An example of a practical calculation using the developed mathematical model is given. The calculations were performed for Huawei, a key global provider of ICT infrastructure and smart terminals. The algorithms were designed to account for uncertainty, which allows to use the results for risk management applications. In practice, this theoretical concept can serve as a basis for digital logistics platforms, increasing the speed of delivery of goods and cargo and the profitability of logistics as a result. The solution to this problem will allow to consider the nodes of logistics networks as smart independent divisions with an information interface for interaction built into a digital logistics platform. The role of these nodes is to make the best decisions in handling cargo flows. As the next stage of research, we plan to develop algorithms for coordinating the information flows reflecting transport activities and forming the material flows entering and leaving the distribution centers.",Shmatko A.; Barykin S.; Sergeev S.; Thirakulwanich A.,Journal,"Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity",2021-03-01,King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang;Russian Academy of Sciences;Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University,Digital logistics ;  Digital supply chains ;  Huawei ;  Production management
Fostering Innovation in Prevention and Treatment of Obesity in Youth: Digitally Mediated Physical Play as an Exemplar,"Novel approaches to obesity prevention among youth are needed. Accordingly, the Office of Women’s Health, Department of Health and Human Services, sponsored a challenge to create an interactive video game for obesity prevention. Our team took a theory-based, evidence-informed approach to increasing physical activity in girls. Our approach—digitally mediated physical play—allowed us to include computing-based strategies that promote activity without keeping players in front of a screen. Our prize-winning prototype app, Frolic, helps girls choose the perfect game to play in any context, engaging parents for support. The app is used to highlight some opportunities and challenges for interdisciplinary collaboration. However, much work remains to be done to deploy innovative digital obesity interventions and fully capture the contributions of these tools. In order to accelerate advances, funding is needed for projects that combine engineering design principles with traditional obesity research paradigms.",Kalarchian M.; Hammer J.; Kapuścińska A.,Journal,Obesity,2021-03-01,School of Computer Science;Carnegie Mellon University;Duquesne University,
Progress of polymer gels for conformance control in oilfield,"For the past decades, long-term water flooding processes have led to water channeling in mature reservoirs, which is a severe problem in oilfields. The development of better plugging ability and cost-effective polymer gel is a key aspect for the control of excess water production. Research on polymer gel applicable in a heterogeneous reservoir to plug high permeable channels has been growing significantly as revealed by numerous published scientific papers. This review intends to discuss the polymer gel techniques from innovations to applications. The related difficulties and future prospects of polymer gels are also covered. Developments of polymer gels to resist temperature, early gel formation, synergistic mechanisms and influence of pH, high salinity are systematically emphasized. The review provides a basis to develop polymer gels for future applications in oilfields to meet harsh reservoir conditions. It will assist the researchers to further develop polymer gels to improve the oil recovery from mature reservoirs under economic conditions to meet the requirements of future oilfields.",Kang W.; Kang X.; Lashari Z.; Li Z.; Zhou B.; Yang H.; Sarsenbekuly B.; Aidarova S.,Journal,Advances in Colloid and Interface Science,2021-03-01,China University of Petroleum (East China);Kazakh-British Technical University,Conformance control ;  Microgels ;  Nanoparticles ;  Organic polymer gel ;  Preformed particle gel ;  Water shut off
Applying quality function deployment in open innovation engineering,"The purpose of the present study was to identify the customer requirements and engineering attribute expectations of an innovative product to which a Kano’s model and quality function deployment (QFD) analysis was applied. In order to accomplish the research, a new water filling machine design was used as the case study. This alternative machine was aimed at making life more convenient and to support people interested in small businesses, since a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) filling machine saved production costs. This research began by classifying the obtained answers from questionnaires into groups. We then conducted a statistical analysis on potential users. The number of elements of the customer requirements was 11 and the number of engineering attributes expected was 5. The customer requirements of the innovated automatic filling machine was quickly identified. The machine, therefore, was designed and evaluated according to the considerations and relationships between customer requirements and engineering characteristics, where the cost and the machining capacity were considered important factors in the analysis.",Rianmora S.; Werawatganon S.,Journal,"Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity",2021-03-01,Thammasat University,Customer requirement ;  Engineering attributes ;  Innovative design ;  Kano’s model ;  Quality function de-ployment ;  Water filling machine
Nexus on climate change: agriculture and possible solution to cope future climate change stresses,"The changing climate scenarios harshen the biotic stresses including boosting up the population of insect/pest and disease, uplifting weed growth, declining soil beneficial microbes, threaten pollinator, and boosting up abiotic stresses including harsh drought/waterlogging, extremisms in temperature, salinity/alkalinity, abrupt rainfall pattern)) and ulitamtely affect the plant in multiple ways. This nexus review paper will cover four significant points viz (1) the possible impacts of climate change; as the world already facing the problem of food security, in such crucial period, climatic change severely affects all four dimensions of food security (from production to consumption) and will lead to malnutrition/malnourishment faced by low-income peoples. (2) How some major crops (wheat, cotton, rice, maize, and sugarcane) are affected by stress and their consequent loss. (3) How to develop a strategic work to limit crucial factors, like their significant role in climate-smart breeding, developing resilience to stresses, and idiotypic breeding. Additionally, there is an essence of improving food security, as much of our food is wasted before consumption for instance post-harvest losses. (4) Role of biotechnology and genetic engineering in adaptive introgression of the gene or developing plant transgenic against pests. As millions of dollars are invested in innovation and research to cope with future climate change stresses on a plant, hence community base adaptation of innovation is also considered an important factor in crop improvements. Because of such crucial predictions about the future impacts of climate change on agriculture, we must adopt measures to evolve crop.",Shahzad A.; Ullah S.; Dar A.; Sardar M.; Mehmood T.; Tufail M.; Shakoor A.; Haris M.,Journal,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,2021-03-01,"University of Agriculture, Faisalabad;Shaanxi University of Science and Technology;Universitat de Lleida;Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences;Università di Trento;Hohai University",Biotic/abiotic stresses on agriculture ;  CFF ;  Climate change ;  Climate-smart breeding ;  Food security ;  Ideotype breeding ;  Resilience in agriculture ;  Threat and impact of climate change on agriculture ;  Use of biotechnology and genetic engineering in crop improvement
The moderating effect of absorptive capacity on transnational knowledge spillover and the innovation quality of high-tech industries in host countries: Evidence from the Chinese manufacturing industry,"A considerable literature has grown up around the theme of the impact of knowledge spillover on the firm's innovation performance. Nevertheless, few literatures draw on any research into the impact of transnational knowledge spillover on innovation quality, especially from conscious and unconscious perspectives. What's more, it has been proven that absorptive capacity plays a crucial role on innovation quality, while the relationship between knowledge spillover and absorptive capacity and its impact on innovation quality have yet to be identified. This study therefore defines the transnational knowledge spillover and distinguishes it from involuntary to voluntary, analyzes their impact on the innovation quality of high-tech industries in host countries, and builds a theoretical model that involves absorptive capacity as the moderating variable. Meanwhile, this study collects data on China's high-tech manufacturing industries from 2010 to 2017 to conduct an empirical analysis and the main results were described as following: with an increase in unconscious transnational knowledge spillover, the innovation quality of high-tech manufacturing industries firstly decreases and then increases. Conversely, with an increase in conscious transnational knowledge spillover, the innovation quality of high-tech manufacturing industries firstly increases and then decreases. Impressively, absorptive capacity has a significant positive moderating effect on the relationship between transnational knowledge spillover and the innovation quality of high-tech industries in host countries.",Duan Y.; Liu S.; Cheng H.; Chin T.; Luo X.,Journal,International Journal of Production Economics,2021-03-01,Yunnan University of Finance and Economics;Zhejiang University of Technology,Absorptive capacity ;  High-tech industries ;  Host countries ;  Innovation quality ;  Transnational knowledge spillover
Comparative Analysis of Manual and Robotic Concrete Drilling for Installation Hangers,"Robots have increased the safety, productivity, and quality of manufacturing. Recently, sensing, computing, and mapping technologies have started to enable the use of robots in unstructured environments like construction. As robotic construction methods are being prototyped and adopted on site, innovation leaders in construction must analyze the safety, productivity, quality, and cost impacts of the deployment of robots. The researchers gained access to engineering, planning, and production data for the first use of a concrete drilling robot on site. This paper compares the traditional way of drilling holes with the robotic way. Compared to manual drilling for installation hangers, the robot achieved a 10% time reduction, increased task ergonomics by cutting 98% of muscle strain work hours, and reduced rework from 5% to 3%. Our comparison pays particular attention to the three levers a project team has to influence project outcomes - the product, the organization, and the process - and found that decisions like implementing a building information model (BIM) at Level of Development (LOD) 400 facilitated the robot use. This study makes two contributions to the fields of construction robotics and project management: First, this research shares a careful analysis of the application of a drilling robot to offer insights into the applicability of robots on site. Second, this analysis suggests key elements and procedures of a framework to compare robotic and traditional construction methods. Future research should establish the generality of this analysis framework.",Brosque C.; Skeie G.; Fischer M.,Journal,Journal of Construction Engineering and Management,2021-03-01,Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering;Kruse Smith Entreprenør AS,
Industry 4.0 and the human factor – A systems framework and analysis methodology for successful development,"The fourth industrial revolution we currently witness changes the role of humans in operations systems. Although automation and assistance technologies are becoming more prevalent in production and logistics, there is consensus that humans will remain an essential part of operations systems. Nevertheless, human factors are still underrepresented in this research stream resulting in an important research and application gap. This article first exposes this gap by presenting the results of a focused content analysis of earlier research on Industry 4.0. To contribute to closing this gap, it then develops a conceptual framework that integrates several key concepts from the human factors engineering discipline that are important in the context of Industry 4.0 and that should thus be considered in future research in this area. The framework can be used in research and development to systematically consider human factors in Industry 4.0 designs and implementations. This enables the analysis of changing demands for humans in Industry 4.0 environments and contributes towards a successful digital transformation that avoid the pitfalls of innovation performed without attention to human factors. The paper concludes with highlighting future research directions on human factors in Industry 4.0 as well as managerial implications for successful applications in practice.",Neumann W.; Winkelhaus S.; Grosse E.; Glock C.,Journal,International Journal of Production Economics,2021-03-01,Universität des Saarlandes;Toronto Metropolitan University;Technische Universität Darmstadt,Content analysis ;  Digital transformation ;  Ergonomics ;  Human factors ;  Industry 4.0 ;  System design
Dielectrophoresis: Developments and applications from 2010 to 2020,"The 20th century has seen tremendous innovation of dielectrophoresis (DEP) technologies, with applications being developed in areas ranging from industrial processing to micro- and nanoscale biotechnology. From 2010 to present day, there have been 981 publications about DEP. Of over 2600 DEP patents held by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, 106 were filed in 2019 alone. This review focuses on DEP-based technologies and application developments between 2010 and 2020, with an aim to highlight the progress and to identify potential areas for future research. A major trend over the last 10 years has been the use of DEP techniques for biological and clinical applications. It has been used in various forms on a diverse array of biologically derived molecules and particles to manipulate and study them including proteins, exosomes, bacteria, yeast, stem cells, cancer cells, and blood cells. DEP has also been used to manipulate nano- and micron-sized particles in order to fabricate different structures. The next 10 years are likely to see the increase in DEP-related patent applications begin to result in a greater level of technology commercialization. Also during this time, innovations in DEP technology will likely be leveraged to continue the existing trend to further biological and medical-focused applications as well as applications in microfabrication. As a tool leveraged by engineering and imaginative scientific design, DEP offers unique capabilities to manipulate small particles in precise ways that can help solve problems and enable scientific inquiry that cannot be addressed using conventional methods.",Sarno B.; Heineck D.; Heller M.; Ibsen S.,Journal,Electrophoresis,2021-03-01,Department of NanoEngineering;Oregon Health & Science University,Biotechnology ;  Cell separation ;  Dielectrophoresis ;  Nanofabrication ;  Nanotechnology
Evaluating the NSF broader impacts with the Inclusion-Immediacy Criterion: A retrospective analysis of nanotechnology grants,"A major goal of government and non-profit scientific funding agencies is to support research and development (R&D) that has broad impacts. This study proposes a new framework, called the Inclusion-Immediacy Criterion (IIC), to determine whether research benefits marginalized communities, reduces inequality, and encourages inclusive innovation. To test the framework, the study analyzes NSF sponsored nanotechnology grant abstracts from 2013 to 2017. We find that 109 out of the 300 grants feature research and grant activities that are inclusive, while 235 out of the 300 grants have research and grant activities that either maintain the status quo or predominately target advantaged groups. Of the 109 grants with inclusive broader impacts, 9 of them involve inclusive research that is intrinsic to the underlying work. In comparison there are 102 grants that feature inclusive research that is directly related to the research. Of those 102 direct-inclusive grants, 99 of them relate to broadening participation of women and underrepresented minority populations is science fields.",Woodson T.; Hoffmann E.; Boutilier S.,Journal,Technovation,2021-03-01,College of Engineering and Applied Sciences;Stony Brook University;Johns Hopkins University,Broader impacts ;  Inclusion-immediacy criterion ;  Inequality ;  Nanotechnology ;  National science foundation
Economic crisis and innovation capacity of Japan: Evidence from cross-country patent citations,"By comparing the cross-country citation performance of patents registered in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), this paper investigates how the economic crisis that Japan faced in the early 1990s altered the innovation capacity of the nation once regarded as a technological powerhouse. The following main findings are reported based on a difference-in-differences framework. First, overall, Japan performed poorly in terms of citations received for its patents compared to control patents in the post-crisis period. This corroborates with the common finding that Japan suffered a marked decline in research performance compared to international standards in the 1990s and 2000s. Second, the crisis exerted prolonged adverse effects on the citation performance of Japanese patents, even 10 years after the crisis. In particular, it caused a permanent drop in non–US citations of Japanese patents. This reduction in citations offset the superior performance of Japanese patents in the pre-crisis period.",Yamashita N.,Journal,Technovation,2021-03-01,College of Business and Law;Keio University;The Australian National University,Citations ;  Economic crisis ;  Innovation ;  Innovation capacity ;  Japan ;  Patents
Forty years of World Patent Information: A bibliometric overview,"World Patent Information (WPI) is the leading international academic peer reviewed journal in the field of patent information.

Impacts of innovation on renewable energy technology cost reductions,"Energy technology cost reductions are the result of many innovation trends in the energy system. The energy technology innovation system is increasingly well understood at an aggregate level and using qualitative concepts. However, the quantification of the multiple drivers of energy technology cost reduction trends remains poorly understood. This paper addresses this knowledge gap by presenting a systematic review of current practices. Despite their simplifications, one-factor learning curves (i.e. using a single driver) remain the most popular method for quantitative modelling of energy technology innovation. The role of multiple drivers on cost reductions has been cited in previous studies. This review enriches our understanding of these multiple drivers by examining their impact along different stages of technology development. The review quantifies the variation in these drivers and shows that the development of multi-factor learning curve models and bottom-up cost models are still in their infancy. With a focus on onshore wind and solar PV technologies, the review finds that most of the published multi-factor learning curve analyses are focused on addressing the impact of drivers related to i) manufacturing process improvements (i.e. learning by-doing) and ii) technology feature improvements (i.e. learning by-researching). This means that the other learning drivers such as market dynamics and learning by-interacting across different stakeholders and geographical areas are still poorly quantified, despite their impact on cost reduction being recognised in the innovation literature. There is a danger that misinformed policies are currently being developed in the absence of a good understanding of these multiple drivers.",Elia A.; Kamidelivand M.; Rogan F.; Ó Gallachóir B.,Journal,Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,2021-03-01,University College Cork,Bottom-up cost model ;  Energy technology innovation ;  Multi factor learning curves ;  Onshore wind ;  Solar photovoltaic
Review of current and future bio-based stabilisation products (enzymatic and polymeric) for road construction materials,"In situ soil modification is required in order to improve the primary engineering properties of the material to meet a road construction standard. Bio-stabilised soil is an environmentally friendly, cost-effective alternative to imported granular fills, concrete, costly hauling of materials or export to a landfill. In-service soil performance and required maintenance is highly dependent on methods of stabilisation, ranging from expensive mechanical stabilisation to chemical processes. As such, many alternative materials originating from bio-based sources are being explored as potential stabilising additives to improve weak subgrade soils (i.e., dispersive, erodible and collapsible soil, and soft or expansive clays). Some key solutions include the use of bio-derived enzymes, microbes, and polymeric additives to avert road failure caused by water penetration and/or erosion. The role of microbial substrate specialisation has been largely unexplored, since the level of research done on alternative stabilisers consists mostly of small ad hoc studies. In addition, research has focused on a reduction in permeability and an increase in compressive strength using enzymes and polymers, however, the complexity of these products and their implementation for a wide range of soil types and structural applications remain limited. Currently there is a need for more supporting research methodologies and systematic approaches on the implementation of bio-based materials for infrastructure development. This also includes the simplification of bio-based products for potential construction applications. This review provides (a) an overview of soil stabilisation techniques, (b) the primary challenges that lay ahead for future research in bio-based stabilisation products application in the road sector and (c) innovations to address the challenges of using modernised techniques in the road construction industry (i.e., weak subgrade and the required maintenance thereof, as well as the development of potential bio-based additives for unpaved road construction application).",Ramdas V.; Mandree P.; Mgangira M.; Mukaratirwa S.; Lalloo R.; Ramchuran S.,Journal,Transportation Geotechnics,2021-03-01,The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research;University of KwaZulu-Natal,Bacillus species ;  Bio-additives ;  Biopolymers ;  Road construction ;  Soil stabilisation ;  Soil stabiliser
"A survey of multiscale modeling: Foundations, historical milestones, current status, and future prospects","Research problems in the domains of physical, engineering, biological sciences often span multiple time and length scales, owing to the complexity of information transfer underlying mechanisms. Multiscale modeling (MSM) and high-performance computing (HPC) have emerged as indispensable tools for tackling such complex problems. We review the foundations, historical developments, and current paradigms in MSM. A paradigm shift in MSM implementations is being fueled by the rapid advances and emerging paradigms in HPC at the dawn of exascale computing. Moreover, amidst the explosion of data science, engineering, and medicine, machine learning (ML) integrated with MSM is poised to enhance the capabilities of standard MSM approaches significantly, particularly in the face of increasing problem complexity. The potential to blend MSM, HPC, and ML presents opportunities for unbound innovation and promises to represent the future of MSM and explainable ML that will likely define the fields in the 21st century.",Radhakrishnan R.,Journal,AIChE Journal,2021-03-01,School of Engineering and Applied Science,high-performance computing ;  machine learning ;  multiphysics modeling ;  multiscale modeling
Engaging citizens to boost climate neutrality and greater circularity: opportunities and challenges for research and innovation,"The article argues that citizen engagement can reconnect science with society and improve related policymaking. This matters most for the challenges that defy purely technocratic solutions and call for changes in lifestyles and behaviour, the transition to climate neutrality and greater circularity being a prime example. To be effective, citizen engagement has to be inclusive, deliberative and influential; other forms of societal outreach fail this triple test. Participatory action research and citizen science can provide inspiration, as well as tools and techniques. Citizen engagement requires specific entry points—such as research and innovation “missions” or transition “super-labs”—which are most likely to emerge at the intersection between science on the one hand and markets and societies on the other. Policymakers need to design clear, predictable and enduring mechanisms but otherwise not interfere, to ensure that citizen engagement remains authentic and legitimate.",Schönwälder G.,Journal,Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy,2021-03-01,European Commission,
Heterogeneous impact of CO<inf>2</inf> emissions on renewable energy technology innovation between oil importers and exporters,"With the depletion of fossil energy and the rise of global temperature, it is urgent to use renewable energy to solve environmental problems. By studying the heterogeneous relationship between CO2 emissions and renewable energy technology innovation in different countries, we can find out the gap and something helpful to energy development. In the empirical test, we use the negative binomial regression model with fixed effects to study the impact of CO2 emissions on renewable energy technology innovation from 1997 to 2016. The research shows that impact is positive in oil-importing countries, but this relationship is not established in oil-exporting countries. In both oil importers and oil exporters, CO2 emissions have a positive effect on the solar energy technological innovation, however, the influence on the technology innovation of solar energy in oil exporters is more significant than that of renewable energy. Whether for oil importers or oil exporters, it can be more reasonable and effective to develop renewable energy by clarifying the impact of CO2 emissions on domestic renewable energy technology innovation.",Liu B.; Liu Y.; Zhang A.,Journal,Energy and Environment,2021-03-01,Jilin University,CO  emissions 2 ;  oil countries ;  renewable energy ;  solar energy ;  technology innovation

A Report on the Second International Workshop on Software Engineering for Artificial Intelligence (SE4AI 2021),"Computers control increasing numbers of objects in our daily life: phones, aircraft, cars, buildings, manufacturing machines, musical instruments, etc. In these so-called cyber-physical systems (CPSs), computers interact directly with the physical world through sensors and actuators. Those systems are becoming the key infrastructure and backbone of our society and are at the heart of revolutionary changes in our daily lives and economy. The sophistication and complexity of CPSs keep increasing since they must realize more functions with limited resources, which makes them increasingly difficult to build and manage. In particular, the cyber (software) part of these systems is growing rapidly and has become a key part of CPS, as they are the basis of operation for these systems. Artificial intelligence (AI) has a fundamental influence on the economy, administration, and society. AI is now also affecting software engineering, providing robust approaches for software development to analyze and evaluate complex software and its development processes.

Valuing the option to prototype: A case study with Generation Integrated Energy Storage,"New energy generation and storage systems are continuously being developed due to climate change, resource scarcity, and environmental laws. Some systems are incremental innovations of existing systems while others are radical innovations. Radical innovation systems are risky investments due to their relevant technical and economic uncertainties. Prototyping can hedge these risks by spending a fraction of the cost of a full-scale system and in return receiving economic and technical information regarding the system. In economic terms, prototyping is an option to hedge risk coming at a cost that needs to be properly assessed. Real options analysis is the project appraisal approach for these assessments. This paper aims to introduce and test an algorithm based on real options analysis to quantitatively assess the “option to prototype” in the energy sector. First, the interrelated research areas of prototyping, energy systems, and real options analysis are reviewed. Then, a novel algorithm is presented and applied to an innovative Generation Integrated Energy Storage system: Wind-driven Thermal Pumping to demonstrate the effectiveness of option to prototype and the main parameters influencing this decision.

"Socio-technical analysis of a sanitation innovation in a peri-urban household in Durban, South Africa","The provision of water and sanitation for all that is safe, dignified, reliable, affordable and sustainable is a major global challenge. While centralized sewer-based sanitation systems remain the dominant approach to providing sanitation, the benefits of non-sewered onsite sanitation systems are increasingly being recognised. This paper presents the outcomes of the testing of the Blue Diversion Autarky Toilet (BDAT), a sanitation system providing hygiene and dignity without relying on water and wastewater infrastructure, in a peri-urban household in Durban, South Africa. The BDAT was used by a single household as their only form of sanitation during three months of technical and social testing. An analysis based on technical data in combination with interpretive, qualitative research methods revealed that the BDAT functioned well and achieved high levels of social acceptance in the test household. The flushing, cleanliness and odour-free nature of the sanitation technology, its functionality, the household's previous sanitation experience, and their experience with and understanding of water scarcity, were the main factors underpinning their positive response to this innovation in sanitation. The testing process resulted in broader developmental benefits for the household, including improved basic services due to the upgrading of the electrical and existing sanitation system, social learning, and improved relationships between household members and the local state. A transdisciplinary research process, which emerged through the assessment, enabled the integration of different forms of knowledge from multiple actors to address the complexity of problems related to the development of socially just sanitation. The benefit of engaging with societal actors in sanitation innovation and assessing its outcomes using both the technical and social sciences is evident in this paper.",Sutherland C.; Reynaert E.; Dhlamini S.; Magwaza F.; Lienert J.; Riechmann M.; Buthelezi S.; Khumalo D.; Morgenroth E.; Udert K.; Sindall R.,Journal,Science of the Total Environment,2021-02-10,"ETH Zürich;University of KwaZulu-Natal;Eawag - Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology;Fraunhofer Institute for High-Speed Dynamics, Ernst-Mach-Institut EMI",Field test ;  Service delivery ;  Social acceptance ;  Source separation ;  Transdisciplinary research ;  Water reuse

Printable Organic Electronic Materials for Precisely Positioned Cell Attachment,"Over the past 3 decades, there has been a vast expansion of research in both tissue engineering and organic electronics. Although the two fields have interacted little, the materials and fabrication technologies which have accompanied the rise of organic electronics offer the potential for innovation and translation if appropriately adapted to pattern biological materials for tissue engineering. In this work, we use two organic electronic materials as adhesion points on a biocompatible poly(p-xylylene) surface. The organic electronic materials are precisely deposited via vacuum thermal evaporation and organic vapor jet printing, the proven, scalable processes used in the manufacture of organic electronic devices. The small molecular-weight organics prevent the subsequent growth of antifouling polyethylene glycol methacrylate polymer brushes that grow within the interstices between the molecular patches, rendering these background areas both protein and cell resistant. Last, fibronectin attaches to the molecular patches, allowing for the selective adhesion of fibroblasts. The process is simple, reproducible, and promotes a high yield of cell attachment to the targeted sites, demonstrating that biocompatible organic small-molecule materials can pattern cells at the microscale, utilizing techniques widely used in electronic device fabrication.",Horowitz J.; Zhong X.; Depalma S.; Ward Rashidi M.; Baker B.; Lahann J.; Forrest S.,Journal,Langmuir,2021-02-09,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",

New product idea selection in the fuzzy front end of innovation: A fuzzy best-worst method and group decision-making process,"New product development (NPD) is essential to most business organizations to create new values and protect existing values for maintaining high profitability and sustainability. However, the success of NPD projects is deemed to be difficult and challenging owing to high organizational complexity, uncertain business environment, and time-critical innovation. Under the smart manufacturing paradigm, NPD is an active research area to establish effective measures through the adoption of systematic approaches so as to facilitate idea management in the fuzzy front end for the product innovation. In this paper, the domain of new product idea selection is focused on and enhanced by means of the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach, in which multiple criteria and sub-criteria can be considered in the selection process. Among a number of MCDM approaches, the fuzzy set theory and best-worst method (BWM) are integrated as the fuzzy BWM in this study to structure the new product idea selection process under a group decision-making process. The hierarchy structure for the new product idea selection is also established to consider the perspectives of finance, marketing, engineering, manufacturing, and sustainability. Overall speaking, this study contributes to the field of NPD through overcoming the new product idea selection problem, while the group decision-making process is incorporated into the fuzzy BWM.",Li S.; Chan F.; Tsang Y.; Lam H.,Journal,Mathematics,2021-02-02,The Hang Seng University of Hong Kong;The Hong Kong Polytechnic University,Best worst method ;  Fuzzy set ;  Group decision-making ;  Idea selection ;  Multi-criteria decision-making ;  New product development
Lithium-Air Batteries: Air-Electrochemistry and Anode Stabilization,"ConspectusIt is a permanent issue for modern society to develop high-energy-density, low-cost, and safe batteries to promote technological innovation and revolutionize the human lifestyle. However, the current popular Li-ion batteries are approaching their ceiling in energy density, and thus other battery systems with more power need to be proposed and studied to guide this revolution. Lithium-air batteries are among the candidates for next-generation batteries because of their high energy density (3500 Wh/kg). The past 20 years have witnessed rapid developments of lithium-air batteries in electrochemistry and material engineering with scientists' collaboration from all over the world. Despite these advances, the investigation on Li-air batteries is still in its infancy, and many bottleneck problems, including fundamental and application difficulties, are waiting to be resolved. For the electrolyte, it is prone to be attacked by intermediates (LiO2, O2-, 1O2, O22-) and decomposed at high voltage, accompanying side reactions that will induce cathode passivation. For the lithium anode, it can be corroded severely by H2O and the side products, thus protection methods are urgently needed. As an integrated system, the realization of high-performance Li-air batteries requires the three components to be optimized simultaneously.In this Account, we are going to summarize our progress for optimizing Li-air batteries in the past decade, including air-electrochemistry and anode optimization. Air-electrochemistry involves the interactions among electrolytes, cathodes, and air, which is a complex issue to understand. The search for stable electrolytes is first introduced because at the early age of its development, the use of incompatible Li-ion battery electrolytes leads to some misunderstandings and troubles in the advances of Li-air batteries. After finding suitable electrolytes for Li-air batteries, the fundamental research in the reaction mechanism starts to boom, and the performance has achieved great improvement. Then, air electrode engineering is introduced to give a general design principle. Examples of carbon-based cathodes and all-metal cathodes are discussed. In addition, to understand the influence of air components on Li-air batteries, the electro-activity of N2 has been tested and the role of CO2 in Li-O2/CO2 has been refreshed. Following this, the strategies for anode optimization, including constructing artificial films, introducing hydrophobic polymer electrolytes, adding electrolyte additives, and designing alloy anodes, have been discussed. Finally, we advocate researchers in this field to conduct cell level optimizations and consider their application scenarios to promote the commercialization of Li-air batteries in the near future.",Chen K.; Yang D.; Huang G.; Zhang X.,Journal,Accounts of Chemical Research,2021-02-02,"University of Science and Technology of China;Changchun Institute Of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy Of Sciences",
Chitosan-based membranes preparation and applications: Challenges and opportunities,"Chitosan is an abundant natural biopolymer which finds a variety of applications due to its functionalization extending to pharmacology, controlled drug delivery, healing materials, biomedical engineering, food industry, agriculture, catalysis, biosorbents, wastewater treatment, etc. Chitosan can be transformed to distinct derivatives and composites and be modified and grafted for specific use. Many products like flakes, fine powders, beads, membranes, sponges, fibers, and gels can be formed from chitosan. Degradable membranes made of chitosan in conjunction with other materials have increased their scope and include adsorptive membranes for heavy metal and dyes, biomedical applications of chitosan electrospun nanofibers, metal complexation, polymer and modified chitosan-based nanocomposites, cellulose and chitosan composites in wastewater treatment, fuel cells and catalysis. The review has focused on a number of issues related to the said areas. Application of these composite membranes with real industrial effluents should be done with reference to the commercial adsorbents and then their application for removal of aromatics, oils, surfactants, etc. will become practical.

Design of a didactical activity for the analysis of uncertainties in thermography through the use of robust statistics as teacher-oriented approach,"The thermography as a methodology to quantitative data acquisition is not usually addressed in the degrees of university programs. The present manuscript proposes a novel approach for the acquisition of advanced competences in engineering courses associated with the use of thermographic images via free/open-source software solutions. This strategy is established from a research based on the statistical and three-dimensional visualization techniques over thermographic imagery to improve the interpretation and comprehension of the different sources of error affecting the measurements and, thereby, the conclusions and analysis arising from them. The novelty is focused on the detection of non-normalities in thermographic images, which is illustrates in the experimental section. Additionally, the specific workflow for the generation of learning material related with this aim is raised for asynchronous and e-learning programs. These virtual materials can be easily deployed in an institutional learning management system, allowing the students to work with the models by means of free/open-source solutions easily. Subsequently, the present approach will give new tools to improve the application of professional techniques, will improve the students’ critical sense to know how to interpret the uncertainties in thermography using a single thermographic image, therefore they will be better prepared to face future challenges with more critical thinking.",Rodríguez-Gonzálvez P.; Rodríguez-Martín M.,Journal,Remote Sensing,2021-02-01,Universidad de Salamanca;Universidad de León,3D imaging ;  E-learning ;  Education and training ;  Engineering ;  Innovation ;  Thermography ;  Virtual laboratory

"Accumulation conditions and key exploration and development technologies of marine shale gas field in Changning-Weiyuan block, Sichuan Basin","Shale gas resource is abundant and has a broad development prospects in China, but the quality of shale gas resources in China is different from that in the United States. China must develop its own development techniques. For this purpose, based on independent innovation, China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC)has carried out systematic theoretical and technical research on the geological and engineering characteristics of Longmaxi Formation shale gas in the southern Sichuan Basin. Guided by ""three-factor controlling"" theory, i.e., ""reservoir controlled by sedimentation and diagenesis, reservoir forming controlled by preservation condition, and production controlled by continuous thickness of reservoir"", for marine shale gas enrichment and high yield, six key exploration and development technologies suitable for marine shale gas suffered from multi-stage tectonic evolution in South China have been established, including comprehensive geological evaluation, developmental optimization, horizontal-well optimal fast drilling, horizontal-well volume fracturing, industrial operation, and efficient and clean production, to industrialize the large-scale exploitation of shale gas. By the end of 2019, the proved geological reserves of shale gas in the southern Sichuan Basin submitted by CNPC had exceeded over 1.06×1012m3, the production capacity had reached 100×108m3, with the cumulative gas production capacity of 200×108m3. It has made remarkable achievements and accumulated valuable experience. It is of great significance for developing shale gas industry, reducing the dependence on foreign resources, ensuring national energy security, and realizing the ""ecological priority and green development"" strategy.",He X.; Wu J.; Yong R.; Zhao S.; Zhou X.; Zhang D.; Zhang D.; Zhong C.,Journal,Shiyou Xuebao/Acta Petrolei Sinica,2021-02-01,China National Petroleum Corporation,Changning-Weiyuan block ;  Efficiently development ;  Exploration and development ;  Hydrofracture ;  Shale gas
Exploring disruptive thinking possibilities in construction and engineering,"Innovation adoption in construction and engineering projects is often claimed to be problematic and slow. Traditional analysis of innovation adoption is grounded in evidence-based practice and financial risk analysis. This has the effect of making innovation development in construction rarely able to disrupt industry. Innovation tends to occur in a drip feed like manner resulting in incremental and slower adoption. This is perceived as a problem for the construction industry. This paper uses the concept of Disruptive Thinking to examine a potential frame of reference for construction practitioners in their work and how they approach innovation adoption. The research uses interviews producing personal stories with professionals working on construction and engineering projects. The research shows that there is some evidence of use of disruptive mindsets by construction and engineering professionals, resulting in disruptive practice in certain sectors, not in the construction industry as a whole. The paper concludes that Disruptive Thinking is a starting point, and vehicle that can lead practitioners to more readily adopt innovation. Disruptive thinking can be a means to adoption when the mindset of evidence-based practice can be infiltrated.",Kanjanabootra S.,Journal,Engineering Project Organization Journal,2021-02-01,"The University of Newcastle, Australia",Construction ;  Disruption Theory ;  Disruptive Thinking ;  Innovation
Mechanical properties of hardened 3D printed concretes and mortars-development of a consistent experimental characterization strategy,"Today, it is already foreseeable that additive manufacturing of mortar and concrete has groundbreaking potential and will revolutionize or at least fundamentally change the way we build. In recent years, 3D concrete printing (3DCP) with extrusion-based deposition methods has been pushed forward by a growing research community. Albeit being regarded one of the most promising innovations in construction industry, a consistent characterization methodology for assessing the constitutive behavior of 3D printed, hardened cementitious materials is missing, so far, which hinders its widespread use in engineering practice. The major objective of this paper is to fill this gap by developing a new experimental framework that can thoroughly describe the mechanical properties of 3D printed cementitious materials. Based on both a review of state-of-the-art test setups and a comprehensive experimental campaign, the present paper proposes a set of easy-to-use experimental methods that allow us to assess flexural, tensile, shear and compressive strength as well as fracture energy of 3D printed concretes and mortars in a reliable and reproducible manner. The experimental results revealed anisotropic material behavior for flexural, tensile, shear and compressive loading. Furthermore, they confirm that interval time (time gap between deposition of subsequent layers) has a crucial effect on investigated material properties leading to a severe reduction in strength and fracture energy for longer interval times.",Meurer M.; Classen M.,Journal,Materials,2021-02-01,KU Leuven;Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen,3D-printing concrete (3DPC) ;  Additive manufacturing ;  Compressive strength ;  Digital production with concrete ;  Fracture energy ;  Shear strength ;  Tensile strength ;  Test setups
Future FANET with application and enabling techniques: Anatomization and sustainability issues,"Rapid expansion and technological advancement of Wireless communication lead by researchers in different fields of engineering have achieved various milestones. Its efficient use has proven that days are not too far when even we think of anything flying sensors, actuators of multiple types surrounded by us process it, and try to bring down or show the best possible result. One of the most talked-about innovations in drones the day it was invented. Group of Drones working in a collectively and Ad hoc manner form a Flying Ad hoc network (FANET). The Mobility of UAVs makes it more accessible, which helps in the mobile revolution that the present world is going through. The use of such a network in different applications across the globe is highly demanding. Most of the traditional study compares it with other Ad hoc networks and coupling, relating to them. However, FANET has its considerations relating to the same class of system. This paper presents a comprehensive survey relating FANET and critical points regarding it, ranging from the categorization of FANET, the architecture of FANET, types of possible communication in FANET, numerous Mobility Models, constraints in FANET, characteristics, and design of FANET, routing protocol, and routing topology. We further present open issues and challenges in FANET relating to essential parameters and research.

Peer learning as a key component of an integrated teaching method: Overcoming the complexities of physics teaching in large size classes,"Over the last decade, policy makers have urged universities to innovate their teaching methodologies. Although educational research has shown that active methods lead to improvements in learners’ performance more than traditional lectures in small classes, some factors impede active methods from spreading in large size classes. In this paper we aim at fostering these methodological innovations by showing the effectiveness of an integrated teaching methodology that employs peer learning, technology, and traditional lectures in large size classes. In the academic years 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 a quasi-experiment involved more than 600 engineering students per year attending an introductory physics course at Politecnico di Milano. These learners were assigned to two sections and their outcomes in a pretest and a post-test were analyzed through descriptive and inferential statistics. The learning results of the experimental group were always better than the outcomes of the control group, regardless of the difficulty of the physics topics addressed. Furthermore, a very low threshold for the exposure to peer learning has been highlighted in order for it to be effective. These promising results may thus foster ongoing changes in university policy towards the renewal of the teaching methodology.",Bozzi M.; Raffaghelli J.; Zani M.,Journal,Education Sciences,2021-02-01,Politecnico di Milano;Universitat Oberta de Catalunya,Active learning ;  Higher education ;  Large size classes ;  Peer learning ;  Physics teaching ;  Traditional lectures

A biobjective home health care logistics considering the working time and route balancing: A self-adaptive social engineering optimizer,"Home health care (HHC) logistics have become a hot research topic in recent years due to the importance of HHC services for the care of ageing population. The logistics of HHC services as a routing and scheduling problem can be defined as the HHC problem (HHCP) academically including a set of service centers and a large number of patients distributed in a specific geographic environment to provide various HHC services. The main challenge is to provide a valid plan for the caregivers, who include nurses, therapists, and doctors, with regard to different difficulties, such as the time windows of availability for patients, scheduling of the caregivers, working time balancing, the time and cost of the services, routing of the caregivers, and route balancing for their routes. This study establishes a biobjective optimization model that minimizes (i) the total service time and (ii) the total costs of HHC services to meet the aforementioned limitations for the first time. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this research is the first of its kind to optimize the time and cost of HHC services by considering the route balancing. Since the model of the developed HHCP is complex and classified as NP-hard, efficient metaheuristic algorithms are applied to solve the problem. Another innovation is the development of a new self-adaptive metaheuristic as an improvement to the social engineering optimizer (SEO), so-called ISEO. An extensive analysis is done to show the high performance of ISEO in comparison with itself and two well-known metaheuristics, i.e. FireFly algorithm and Artificial Bee Colony algorithm. Finally, the results confirm the applicability of new suppositions of the model and further development and investigation of the ISEO more broadly.",Goodarzian F.; Abraham A.; Fathollahi-Fard A.,Journal,Journal of Computational Design and Engineering,2021-02-01,Machine Intelligence Research Labs (MIR Labs) - Scientific Network for Innovation and Research Excellence;École de Technologie Supérieure,HHC problem ;  HHC services ;  home health care (HHC) ;  metaheuristic algorithms ;  route balancing ;  service time

Towards future BIM technology innovations: A bibliometric analysis of the literature,"The evolution of the construction industry is associated with the continuous implementation of new technologies. Building Information Modelling (BIM) has revolutionised the collaboration and data sharing processes in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. However, it needs to be supported by new technologies that can embrace digital construction by transforming the construction industry into a dynamic environment. There is a lack of understanding of the cutting-edge technologies that have emerged to help with the digital transformation of the construction industry. There is a need to understand all these technologies and how they can be leveraged holistically towards future BIM innovations. Therefore, this article conducts a literature review to evaluate how targeted cutting-edge technologies can be utilised to release the full potential of BIM from a technical perspective. A bibliometric analysis focusing on the co-occurrence of keywords related to various technologies, their links with BIM, and their related research themes was conducted based on the Web of Science (WoS) database holdings from 2010 to 2019. The findings demonstrate that one type of technology can help with solving a specific issue. However, using one technology alone does not solve an issue entirely. The current technology has been utilised independently and not as a coherent system. Thus, a weak information integration and management approach can restrict the leveraging of a smart BIM environment. This paper is not meant to be exclusive. Many new technologies, concepts, and ideas can be added to help realise BIM potentials that are not covered in this study. Furthermore, the analysis was based on the dataset retrieved from WoS and only included the literature in English. Based on those findings, the authors indicated a technology fusion to support BIM development.",Khudhair A.; Li H.; Ren G.; Liu S.,Journal,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),2021-02-01,"Cardiff University;CCCC Second Harbor Consultants Co., Ltd",Bibliometric analysis ;  Building Information Modelling (BIM) ;  Technologies
A new face of mining engineer—international curricula to sustainable development and green deal (A case study of the Wrocław university of science and technology),"The mining industry in the world has undergone a major metamorphosis in recent years.

Robust resource allocation strategy for technology innovation ecosystems: state and control constraints,"This paper considers a robust resource allocation strategy design problem in technology innovation ecosystem. The purpose is for both healthy competition and symbiosis between populations. We formulated this as a control design problem. There are three salient features of this problem. First, the control, since it means the resource and should always be positive, is constrained. Second, the state, since it means the population and should always be positive, is constrained. Third, the system, since it represents the interactions between the societal biomass and the resources, is highly uncertain. We endeavor to propose two separate transformations on the state and the control to convert the system to an equivalent and unconstrained system. In a sense, we embed the constraints into the (nonlinear) intrinsic system structure. Following this, the control design has to address two issues. First, the control is to render desirable performance of this (constraint-embedded) system regardless of the uncertainty. Second, the performance of the original system, which is the primary concern, should be equally within the threshold. This paper should be the first effort that addresses the resource allocation strategy of technology innovation ecosystem from the control perspective.",Chen X.; Sun Q.; Xia F.; Chen Y.,Journal,Nonlinear Dynamics,2021-02-01,The George W.

Tissue adhesives: From research to clinical translation,"Sutures, staples, clips, and skin closure strips are used as the gold standard to close wounds after an injury. In spite of being the present standard of care, the utilization of these conventional methods is precarious amid complicated and sensitive surgeries such as vascular anastomosis, ocular surgeries, nerve repair, or due to the high-risk components included. Tissue adhesives function as an interface to connect the surfaces of wound edges and prevent them from separation. They are fluid or semi-fluid mixtures that can be easily used to seal any wound of any morphology-uniform or irregular. As such, they provide alternatives to new and novel platforms for wound closure methods. In this review, we offer a background on the improvement of distinctive tissue adhesives focusing on the chemistry of some of these products that have been a commercial success from the clinical application perspective.

The global competitive situation of cardiac tissue engineering based on patent analysis,"BACKGROUND: Tissue engineering is the best way to repair or replace organ failure or tissue defects. From the theoretical point of view to the research in many fields, tissue engineering has developed very rapidly. As cardiovascular disease has become one of the most dangerous factors that endanger human health, research on cardiac tissue engineering has made tremendous progress. OBJECTIVE: To provide advices and references for the development and innovation of cardiac tissue engineering based on patent analysis in the field of cardiac tissue engineering that reveals the global competitive situation of cardiac tissue engineering. METHODS: We qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the number and development tendency, technology birthplaces, target markets, applicants, inventors and technical fields of patents in the field of liver tissue engineering in nearly 20 years. The data visualization method is used to present the current status and tendency of global cardiac tissue engineering technology development and China's development status. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The technology for cardiac tissue engineering has been evolved rapidly and highly innovative, with invention patents accounting for 93.91%. The scale of technological development in the field of cardiac tissue engineering in China is not expanded as large as that in the United States, but the growth rate is far faster than that in the United States, and it has accumulated a certain number of high-quality technological achievements, becoming the second largest source of technology in the world. The United States is the most concerned target market in the field of cardiac tissue engineering, and the Chinese market currently ranks fourth. Chinese cardiac tissue engineering has developed rapidly in recent years, growing much faster than that in the United States. There are three institutions in China that has mounted to the front of the world in terms of technology development. Due to a lack of technological achievements with high potential market value, there is still a certain gap between China and the United States. Chinese inventors have achieved certain results in this field, mainly in enterprises. The main fields of technological innovation in this field are heart valve covering materials and cell scaffolds. Through an in-depth and comprehensive analysis of patents in the field of cardiac tissue engineering, it can be found that the global development of cardiac tissue engineering is active and innovative, but generally lacks high-quality results. The United States is the most concerned target market in this field and the most important technology birthplace, whereas China is at a stage of rapid development in this field. In order to improve technological competitiveness, enterprises and universities should strengthen cooperation and focus on research hot spots.",Xu D.; Zhang T.; Ouyang Z.,Journal,Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research,2021-02-01,"Institute of Medical Information & Library, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College",Cardiac tissue engineering ;  Competitive situation ;  Patent analysis ;  Patentometrics
Understanding the impact of environmental regulations on green technology innovation efficiency in the construction industry,"In the current environmentally constrained context, deploying effective environmental regulations (ERs) to promote greener technologies is necessary. Green technology innovation efficiency (GTIE) reflects the efficiency of an industry's use of resources in the green technology innovation process. However, previous research has considered innovation as a black box regarding the potential contribution and diversity of ERs. In order to analyze the differential impacts of ERs on GTIE, this study classifies ERs into command-and-control, market-based and voluntary. By adopting China's 2000–2017 construction industry as a case study, this study analyzes GTIE evolution based on a network Epsilon Based Measure (EBM) model and analyze the impacts of ERs by Tobit Regression. Findings suggest that: (1) There is a significant disconnection between the Research & Development (R&D) and commercial application stages of green technology in construction industry. The construction industry is able to turn most R&D achievements into profits at the commercialization stage, but a large amount of R&D investment does not produce R&D achievements. (2) Different types of ERs have different impacts on GTIE, but their intended outcomes can only be achieved by a suitable combination of them.",Zhang J.; Ouyang Y.; Ballesteros-Pérez P.; Li H.; Philbin S.; Li Z.; Skitmore M.,Journal,Sustainable Cities and Society,2021-02-01,London South Bank University;National Institute for Environmental Studies of Japan;Chang'an University;Universidad de Cádiz;Queensland University of Technology,Environment regulations ;  Green technology innovation ;  Network DEA model ;  Sustainable development ;  Tobit regression model
A process modelling approach to assess the impact of teledermatology deployment onto the skin tumor care pathway,"Background: Teledermatology was raised as a potential answer to increase access and decrease delay for skin cancer management. However, its influence on non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) care pathway has never been studied. Objectives: To compare conventional care pathway to teledermatology (TD) in NMSC care pathways using a process modelling approach. Patients and methods: A period study including three groups was conducted in a department of dermatology. During the first period from January till February 2013 a NMSC care pathway was mapped for a group a prior TD integration. During the second period from September 2016 till October 2018, the NMSC care pathway was determined for patients managed by a conventional care process and after TD diagnosis. Patients characteristics, type of tumors and processes were compared using time as a key performance indicator. Mean were reported with their ± SD. Linear regression was performed using time between multidisciplinary consultation and surgery as outcome adjusted on sex, age and cancer type. Results: During the first period (prior to TD) 89 NMSC patients were managed (mean age = 76 yr old ± 13) during the second period, 36 patients NMSC were managed after TD, mean age of 89 years old ± 6 and 954 patients in a conventional process, mean age of 78 years old ±12. In comparison between the two periods patient's age, sex and cancer distribution significantly differed while the rate of surgery was not significantly different (p = 0.967). Linear multivariate regression using time between multidisciplinary consultation and surgery as outcome adjusted on sex age and cancer type displayed that during the second period patients in the TD group spent 17.6 days more [0.98,34.25] while patient in the conventional care process group had 9.8 days [1.85,17.74] more than patient in the study period 1, (p = 0.04, p = 0.02) without significant difference for age and sex (p = 0.29, p = 0.51). Patients with a SCC had a decreased time between multidisciplinary consultation and surgery of −12.97 days [−17.43, −8.5], p < 10−3. Conclusion: Interestingly, patients managed by TD were significantly older than those managed using a conventional care pathway. Unexpectedly their total time spent in the process was not shorter. The results of this analysis illustrated the interest of using process modelling approach to assess the impact of a healthcare innovation integration and to further rethink coordination and care pathways for NSMC post TD.",Duong T.; Lamé G.; Zehou O.; Skayem C.; Monnet P.; El Khemiri M.; Boudjemil S.; Hirsch G.; Wolkenstein P.; Jankovic M.,Journal,International Journal of Medical Informatics,2021-02-01,Epidemiology in Dermatology and Evaluation of therapeutics (EpiDermE);Université Paris Cité;Université Paris-Saclay;Université Paris-Est Créteil Val de Marne;Hôpital Henri Mondor,Access to care ;  Care pathway ;  Evaluation ;  Non-melanoma skin cancer ;  Process modelling ;  Teledermatology ;  Telehealth ;  Telemedicine
The effect of global value chain position on green technology innovation efficiency: From the perspective of environmental regulation,"Under the open economy, whereas the manufacturing industry has realized transformation and upgrading by the embedding global value chain (GVC) division system, the problems of energy consumption and environmental damage caused by the industry have attracted increasing attention from society. In this paper, the industry classification standard of Trade in Value Added (TiVA) database is used to integrate China's manufacturing industry during 2006–2015. Based on the indicator measurement, corresponding panel data models are constructed to study the impacts of the GVC position on green technology innovation efficiency (GTIE) in the context of environmental regulation. The empirical results show that: (1) The rise of the GVC embedding position significantly promotes the GTIE, and there is industry heterogeneity characterized by pollution intensity and factor density. (2) There is a positive moderating effect and a double threshold effect of environmental regulation on the relationship between the GVC position and the GTIE. The above research findings offer a certain managerial enlightenment for the manufacturing industry of developing countries to guide adjustment of environmental regulation policies, alleviate the pressure on resources and the environment, and even cultivate a new momentum of sustainable economic growth.",Hu D.; Jiao J.; Tang Y.; Han X.; Sun H.,Journal,Ecological Indicators,2021-02-01,Yuxi Normal University;Jiangsu University;Hefei University of Technology,China's manufacturing industry ;  Environmental regulation ;  Global value chain embedding position ;  Green technology innovation efficiency
Methodological framework for analyzing peace engineering: Focusing on Kaesong Industrial Complex and North Korean innovators in South Korea,"This study explores two hypotheses, inspired by peace tourism, to study innovation for peace: “innovation brings peace” and “peace brings innovation.” With respect to the first, the event history analysis of Kaesong Industrial Complex reveals that innovation helps maintain peace by slowing the pace of confrontation. As regards the second, a survey on North Korean innovators in the South unveils the importance of innovator's self-esteem. Causal relationship analysis has shown that the loop structures of innovation in the two cases is involved in sustaining peace. This implies that the problems between the two Koreas can be classified as an “interactive problem.” Our findings suggest that the research on peace engineering can benefit from the existing studies on peace tourism, that problem-oriented innovation systems (PIS) can present a methodological breakthrough, and that the divided Korean peninsula can provide excellent data for case studies. In addition, a methodological framework for analyzing peace engineering was proposed through discussions with peace tourism, PIS, and the theory of socio-technical system. Although this study does not offer the final answer on which is a bigger priority: innovation or peace, our findings will be a good reference for future study of innovation for peace.",Ahn S.; Yi S.,Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2021-02-01,Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology;Seoul National University;Korea Institute of S&T Evaluation and Planning;designated by Ministry of Science and ICT;Science,Conflict management ;  Innovation ;  Korea ;  Peace ;  Resilience ;  Sustainability

Nanoscale engineering of catalytic materials for sustainable technologies,"Nanostructured materials of diverse architecture are ubiquitous in industrial catalysis. They offer exciting prospects to tackle various sustainability challenges faced by society. Since the introduction of the concept a century ago, researchers aspire to control the chemical identity, local environment and electronic properties of active sites on catalytic surfaces to optimize their reactivity in given applications. Nowadays, numerous strategies exist to tailor these characteristics with varying levels of atomic precision. Making headway relies upon the existence of analytical approaches able to resolve relevant structural features and remains challenging due to the inherent complexity even of the simplest heterogeneous catalysts, and to dynamic effects often occurring under reaction conditions. Computational methods play a complementary and ever-increasing role in pushing forward the design. Here, we examine how nanoscale engineering can enhance the selectivity and stability of catalysts. We highlight breakthroughs towards their commercialization and identify directions to guide future research and innovation.",Mitchell S.; Qin R.; Zheng N.; Pérez-Ramírez J.,Journal,Nature Nanotechnology,2021-02-01,ETH Zürich;Xiamen University;Innovation Laboratory for Sciences and Technologies of Energy Materials of Fujian Province (IKKEM),
Biochemical Production with Purified Cell-Free Systems,"Bioprocesses offer a powerful set of opportunities for current chemical process innovation. Such conversions provide opportunities to employ process intensification strategies and the right characteristics to scale down and harness the power of modular process design, but strain engineering and the use of microbial systems for industrial biochemicals production remain unpredictable and expensive. Purified cell-free technologies, in which complex enzyme reaction cascades are used to catalyze bioconversions of interest, can be designed to mitigate these limitations. Such systems allow predictive kinetic modeling and full control of reaction conductions, enabling a dramatically increased design-built-test cycle iteration rate. When sufficiently robust engineered enzymes are used, opportunities to leverage harsh reaction conditions, long-term recycling strategies, and hybridization with chemical catalysis can be used to dramatically improve the value proposition of biochemicals production. Further research is required to realize the potential of these approaches and to address the current platform-limiting challenges around cofactor cost and reuse.",Rollin J.; Bomble Y.; St. John P.; Stark A.,Journal,Biochemical Engineering Journal,2021-02-01,Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy;National Renewable Energy Laboratory,Cell-Free ;  Cofactor Engineering ;  Enzyme Recycling ;  Pathway Optimization ;  Synthetic Biology
"Enablers, Equippers, Shapers and Movers: A typology of innovation intermediaries' interventions and the development of an emergent innovation system","Innovation intermediaries are seen as crucial and critical players in the development of emergent high-tech sectors, though the understanding of their activities is not yet holistic and depends on geographical and sectoral specificities. This paper empirically deploys a recently developed classification within a case study of the New Space sector in Scotland, a previously peripheral region within Space Industry, now emerging as a global leader. Based on secondary document analysis and mixed-method empirical research using primary data from surveys, interviews and social network analysis, this study examines: the positioning of the innovation intermediation organisations in Scottish Space sector's innovation network and the interventions they deploy and effects they expect to have on the sectoral actors. Based on this analysis, a new typology of innovation intermediaries' interventions is proposed, to link them with their identified systemic roles of enablers, equippers, shapers and movers.",Vidmar M.,Journal,Acta Astronautica,2021-02-01,The University of Edinburgh,Innovation intermediaries ;  Intervention typology ;  New Space ;  SMEs
Distance matters: Investigating how geographic proximity to ENGOs triggers green innovation of heavy-polluting firms in China,"Along with the growing concern over resource depletion and environmental damage, an increasing number of firms, especially heavy-polluting firms, have confronted with intense pressure imposed by various stakeholders like government, media and Environmental Non-Governmental Organizations (ENGOs). Specifically, ENGOs, as a classic informal institution, has gradually become as important as governments in stimulating polluting firms to reduce pollutant emissions and implement green innovation. At the same time, due to the imbalances of ENGOs' resource endowments and geographic distributions in various regions, the normative pressure from ENGOs on polluting firms may also differ by geographic distance. Given that, building on economic geography and institutional theory, the current study developed a theoretical framework to illustrate the relationship between geographic proximity to ENGOs and firms' green innovation. The roles of ownership types and regional pollution level are then examined. For a sample of Chinese heavy-polluting firms from 2009 to 2015 and employing multiple linear regression, the study found that a firm's geographic proximity to ENGOs affects green technology innovation positively and significantly. However, the effect of geographic proximity on green management innovation varies as the radius changes. In addition, the regression results also indicated that the positive relation between geographic proximity and green technology innovation is stronger in SOEs than in NSOEs. In turn, the positive relation between geographic distance beyond a 100 km radius and green management innovation is stronger in NSOEs than in SOEs. Moreover, the results further demonstrated that regional pollution level weakens the impact of geographic proximity to ENGOs on green management innovation. The study not only provides an enhanced understanding about the literature on corporate environmental responsibility but also has important practical implications for prompting heavy-polluting firms' green innovation with the aid of ENGOs.",Hu C.; Mao J.; Tian M.; Wei Y.; Guo L.; Wang Z.,Journal,Journal of Environmental Management,2021-02-01,Zhongnan University of Economics and Law,Geographic proximity to ENGOs ;  Green innovation ;  Heavy-polluting firms ;  Ownership types ;  Regional pollution level
Ecosystem-as-structure and ecosystem-as-coevolution: A constructive examination,"As a response to the call for cumulative knowledge in ecosystem research, this paper focuses on ecosystem literature from the perspective of a focal firm. Through an in-depth analysis of modern and classic ecosystem conceptual works, this paper clarifies the theoretical underpinnings of the structure view and the coevolution view of ecosystems. Whereas according to the structure view an ecosystem features a modular structure of multilateral interdependences, coevolutionists envisage it as a community of affiliated and interacting actors which keeps open exchange with environments. To deal with this tension, instead of proposing an integrative or overarching ecosystem definition, this research offers an integrative framework which can accommodate the merits of both views. We do so by suggesting that 1) the coevolution view helps understand where value proposition and complementarities come from and how they come about; 2) the structure view infuses granularity into the coevolution view to specify the ecosystem affiliation as a premise on which coevolution can be orchestrated; 3) affiliation plays the role as a linking concept between the two views, allowing for the focal firm's continuous innovation to be explained.",Hou H.; Shi Y.,Journal,Technovation,2021-02-01,University of Cambridge,
Do lead users cooperate with manufacturers in innovation? Investigating the missing link between lead userness and cooperation initiation with manufacturers,"Past lead user research has provided strong empirical support for the claim that lead users tend to innovate independently. While the innovation activity itself is well documented, little is known about whether users' ideas and solutions also reach manufacturers' organizations. Recent research indicates that the majority of user discoveries remain limited only to local use and are rarely presented to a wider circle of other users, business angels, or manufacturers. This limitation presents a problem because if manufacturers do not have access to users’ needs, ideas, and solutions, they might fail to recognize essential opportunities for innovation. Therefore, this research studies the question of whether lead userness and expected recognition from manufacturers and peers explain the user's inclination to cooperate with manufacturers. We study cooperation initiated from two different ends: users pro-actively approaching manufacturers with problems and ideas and users participating in manufacturer-hosted innovation workshops. Drawing on lead user theory, we develop hypotheses and test them with two empirical studies with nurses and pharmaceutical technical assistants. The results provide support for the argument that a superior trend position and high expected benefits are strong and reliable predictors for both investigated forms of cooperation. The results on the effect of recognition from the manufacturer and peers are mixed, indicating that expected process benefits are less important.",Globocnik D.; Faullant R.,Journal,Technovation,2021-02-01,Universität Klagenfurt;Syddansk Universitet,Cooperation ;  Front end ;  Lead user ;  User innovation ;  User-manufacturer interaction
To explore or exploit: The influence of inter-firm R&D network diversity and structural holes on innovation outcomes,"The degree to which inter-firm research and development (R&D) networks benefit a firm's exploitative and exploratory innovation depends on two factors: (1) the kind of knowledge that the firm can access from networks and (2) how the firm acquire these knowledge resources through its connections. Utilizing a knowledge-based view of the firm, we argue that related and unrelated network knowledge diversity differ in their effect on a company's innovation outcomes and that the existence of structural holes in an inter-firm R&D network has a discrepant, moderating effect on performance. Empirical analyses based on archival data from 158 Chinese automobile companies from 1996 to 2010 indicate that the inter-firm R&D network that emphasizes diversified unrelated knowledge is more beneficial for enhancing a firm's exploratory innovation outcomes. Conversely, the inter-firm R&D network that relies on diversified related knowledge can be more helpful for companies that engage in exploitative innovation. Further, structural holes are expected to be complementary to unrelated network knowledge diversity while a dense neighborhood is complementary to related network knowledge diversity in improving firm exploitative and exploratory innovation outcomes.",Wen J.; Qualls W.; Zeng D.,Journal,Technovation,2021-02-01,Gies College of Business;Hunan University of Technology and Business;Hunan University,Exploitative innovation ;  Exploratory innovation ;  Inter-firm R&D network ;  Network knowledge diversity ;  Structural holes
Integrating Financial Literacy into Introductory Programming,"Contribution: An approach of integrating financial literacy into an introductory programming course is introduced. New learning materials are developed and the impact of the approach on motivating students and improving learning outcomes are evaluated using mixed methods. Background: More than two-thirds of college students in the U.S. graduate with a student loan, but they are not necessarily equipped with essential financial knowledge to manage their debts and make intelligent financial decisions. This issue must be addressed to alleviate any potential negative impact on college education. Since personal finance requires data processing and quantitative analyses, it is a great application context for computing education. The integration of the two can potentially improve students' learning experience and outcome. Research Questions: What learning materials are needed to integrate financial literacy into introductory programming? Does the integration help students improve learning outcomes? Methodology: Learning materials are developed following a set of guiding principles. Both quantitative and qualitative methods are used to evaluate the impact of the approach. Findings: Evaluation indicated that the learning materials and the overall approach are effective in helping students learn programming. Students are also more aware of personal finance.",Zhu H.; Shen Y.,Journal,IEEE Transactions on Education,2021-02-01,Batten College of Engineering & Technology;University of Massachusetts Lowell,Computing education ;  curriculum innovation ;  financial literacy ;  learning materials ;  programming
Government-Controlled Enterprises in Standardization in the Catching-Up Context: Case of TD-SCDMA in China,"In this article we analyze the case of TD-SCDMA system standardization in China. Specifically, we focus on the leading role that government-controlled enterprises (GCEs) played in the standardization, and how the Chinese government supported GCEs. The case study findings advance current knowledge on how governments support standardization efforts in a catching-up context. We found that, under strong government support and with GCEs' leadership, a latecomer country such as China, with certain technological capabilities and in economic, social, and institutional contexts that favor indigenous innovation, can pursue path-breaking innovation with complex technological systems. Governments should engage in various tactics to support GCEs that lead the standardization process. Most importantly, governments should intervene in scoping decisions on technological systems and research and development forces in the standard development stage, and offer moral suasion in the standard diffusion stage. We provide practical implications for governments that support GCEs in technology catching-up.",Gao P.; Gao X.; Liu G.,Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2021-02-01,Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management;Capital University of EcoNomics and Business;The University of Manchester,China ;  government-controlled enterprises (GCEs) ;  government-sponsored standardization ;  standard ;  technology catching-up ;  third generation (3G) ;  time-division synchronous CDMA (TD-SCDMA)

Nanomedicine for Acute Brain Injuries: Insight from Decades of Cancer Nanomedicine,"Acute brain injuries such as traumatic brain injury and stroke affect 85 million people a year worldwide, and many survivors suffer from long-term physical, cognitive, or psychosocial impairments. There are few FDA-approved therapies that are effective at preventing, halting, or ameliorating the state of disease in the brain after acute brain injury. To address this unmet need, one potential strategy is to leverage the unique physical and biological properties of nanomaterials. Decades of cancer nanomedicine research can serve as a blueprint for innovation in brain injury nanomedicines, both to emulate the successes and also to avoid potential pitfalls. In this review, we discuss how shared disease physiology between cancer and acute brain injuries can inform the design of novel nanomedicines for acute brain injuries. These disease hallmarks include dysregulated vasculature, an altered microenvironment, and changes in the immune system. We discuss several nanomaterial strategies that can be engineered to exploit these disease hallmarks, for example, passive accumulation, active targeting of disease-associated signals, bioresponsive designs that are ""smart"", and immune interactions.",Kandell R.; Waggoner L.; Kwon E.,Journal,Molecular Pharmaceutics,2021-02-01,Department of Bioengineering;Department of NanoEngineering,engineering design ;  Nanomedicine ;  stroke ;  traumatic brain injury

Managing Open Innovation: A Project-Level Perspective,"Open innovation has become a mainstream phenomenon in the current business landscape. However, despite the fact that innovation projects generally have different attributes (e.g., complexity and uncertainty), most studies on open innovation have only considered firm-level characteristics (e.g., firm size and firm openness) to determine how to manage open innovation successfully. Project-level studies on open innovation management are still scant - There are only a few conceptual and qualitative articles on the topic, and there is a lack of quantitative insights. Based on a survey designed to collect detailed data from 201 innovation projects undertaken by American firms, this article provides a quantitative cross-project analysis of how two, key innovation project attributes (i.e., complexity and uncertainty) are related to five factors for successful open innovation management: 1) openness level, 2) external partner choice, 3) open innovation mechanism choice, 4) collaboration process formalization, and 5) internal firm practices. This exploratory study contributes to the open innovation literature by highlighting the importance of microfoundations (i.e., innovation project attributes) in successful open innovation management. This article concludes by suggesting a number of relevant project-level future research opportunities in the field of open innovation management, and some methodological recommendations on how to address such opportunities.",Bagherzadeh M.; Markovic S.; Bogers M.,Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2021-02-01,NEOMA Business School;Københavns Universitet;Copenhagen Business School,Open innovation (OI) ;  project attributes ;  project complexity ;  project uncertainty ;  project-level variables

The impact of risk-taking level on green technology innovation: Evidence from energy-intensive listed companies in China,"The impact of company risk on green technology innovation (GTI) has seldom been explored in previous studies. In this study, the relationship between level of risk taking and GTI is empirically investigated and green biased technological progress is examined by dividing the process of GTI into GTI intention and GTI performance: energy-intensive listed companies operating in China from 2011 to 2017 are taken as the research objects. The results show that the level of risk taking negatively affects GTI performance and green biased technological progress. The most important factor acting is the intensity of industrial competition. Various external factors, e.g. environmental regulation, government R&D subsidy, and region are found to significantly influence the GTI intention of the companies. Moreover, these factors determine the GTI performance together with the level of risk taking and R&D input. Finally, suggestions are proposed from a risk perspective to promote the GTI of companies.",Yan X.; Zhang Y.; Pei L.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2021-01-25,Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics;Taiyuan University of Technology,China ;  Energy-intensive listed company ;  Green technology innovation ;  Level of risk taking ;  Sustainable development
Knowledge spillover driven by institutions: evidence from the big science project in China,"Purpose: This study aims to explore the knowledge spillover mechanism in big science projects (BSP) from an institutional perspective by elaborating on the dynamic relationship between institutional dualism and legitimacy. Design/methodology/approach: The study conducts an exploratory research and adopts the grounded theory methodology in the context of BSP. Data draw mainly upon nine semi-structured interviews. Findings: The knowledge spillovers in BSP are driven by institutions, which work through mechanisms of legitimacy perception. Formal and informal institutions influence organizational and individual behavior through legitimacy pressure and support. Formal institutions impose legitimacy pressure on organizations and individuals, forcing them to cooperate closely to solve problems; informal institutions enable them to adopt innovative strategies and positive attitudes through legitimacy support; all these promote knowledge spillovers in research and development (R&D) activities, engineering practice and regional interaction. Knowledge spillovers enable stakeholders to realize their R&D advancement, manufacturing promotion and management sophistication. Further, regional knowledge diffusion and culture transmission promote regional innovation and social capital accumulation. Research limitations/implications: The study develops a theoretical model that shows how knowledge spillover mechanisms happen in BSP from an institutional perspective (the trigger, the channels/process and the impacts). More specifically, this explanation is provided by explaining how formal and informal institutions influence organizational and individual behavior through legitimacy perceptions. Practical implications: First, policymakers should recognize and value the guiding, supporting and coordinating role of formal institutions and enrich capital forms to release the legitimacy pressure of stakeholders. Second, management of BSP needs to be capable of coordinating stakeholder relationships and interactions, while management should focus their attention on fostering good organizational routines and shared group value. Third, the local culture and customs should be taken into consideration since it can be an enabling or constraining of BSP. Finally, industries can take advantage of the opportunity to coordinate their R&D efforts to gain competitiveness. Originality/value: First, the authors introduce the institutional perspective to analyze the construction process of BSP, which helps to better understand the interactions of stakeholders under the influence of institutions, the dynamic process and impacts of knowledge spillovers. Second, the authors are committed to contributing to the development of knowledge spillover theories by adopting an institutional perspective. The authors furthermore explore and propose the presence of a dynamic mechanism between institutional dualism and knowledge spillovers. In consequence, the authors introduce the concept of legitimacy perceptions, which is a bridge to understanding the interaction between them. Third, by explicitly discussing the actual meaning of our framework, the authors explore the unique potential of institutional arrangement in promoting the knowledge management of complex cross-border cooperation, while seeking to promote its management and administrative practices.",Zhang L.; Gao C.; Nakamori Y.,Journal,Journal of Knowledge Management,2021-01-23,University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;Chinese Academy of Sciences;Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology,Big science project ;  Grounded theory ;  Institutions ;  Knowledge spillover ;  Legitimacy ;  University-industry-government (UIG)
Living Materials for Life Healthcare,"Conspectus Living material is a type of composite material with living elements integrated into nonliving components. It combines the advantages of both living cells and nonliving substances and takes advantage of advanced fabrication techniques. Living materials is an emerging new paradigm at the frontiers of materials research. It addresses an intriguing question of how to let materials show life-like capabilities and function in an integrative and programmable way. Of all of the capability and application aspects of living materials, the one related to human health is the most intriguing since it implies that that materials could be made by life and used for life. Specifically, living materials exploit the merits of cells in that they can respond to environmental variables, synthesize functional molecules, and span multiple length scales. At the same time, the abundant coordination between live and nonliving elements opens infinite possibilities for diverse structural and functional features. The resultant biohybrid materials are thus endowed with novel functions that recapitulate or even surpass their natural candidates and ultimately shed new light on biodiagnostics and biotherapeutics to address human health concerns.In this Account, we present a concise summary and analysis of living materials and bring it into the context of addressing life healthcare concerns. We start with the fabrication of living materials, including the engineering of living elements and the manufacturing of biohybrid composites through advanced technologies, particularly micropatterning, microfluidics, and three-dimensional (3D) printing. We then shift to the properties and capacities of living materials, such as autonomous motion, sensing and actuation, and highly sensitive detection. On the basis of these, we show, by representative examples, the healthcare-oriented applications of living materials in both diagnostic and biotherapeutic aspects, including biohybrid sensors and actuators, cell-powered robotics, organ-on-a-chip platforms, wearable devices, smart delivery vehicles, cell therapy, and tissue engineering.Despite the exciting achievements of living materials, challenges remain in the precise manipulation of the properties of living materials; therefore, we provide our insight for future directions in this burgeoning field with respect to both fundamental research and technical innovation. The former concerns a comprehensive understanding of spatiotemporal coordination between living and nonliving components as well as the heterogeneous properties of the biohybrid materials. The latter looks at precise gene editing of living elements, multiscale manufacturing of cell-involved entities, and the incorporation of signal-transducing units for creating advanced living devices. With extensive multidisciplinary cooperation in the aforementioned areas, we expect living materials to stand out at the forefront of material science and engineering and take a giant leap forward to improve human health.",Shang L.; Shao C.; Chi J.; Zhao Y.,Journal,Accounts of Materials Research,2021-01-22,Nanjing University;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;Fudan University;Southeast University,

Information Behavior of Online Academic Social Platform:Case Study of ESI Highly Cited Researchers of ResearchGate,"Academic social networks are profoundly influencing and changing the way researchers connect with each other, share information and collaborate during innovation. Their value is becoming more and more obvious. However, research on academic social networks in general is still very limited, and in particular, there is still a lack of in-depth understanding of users' behavior. This paper aims to investigate the characteristics usage behaviors of ESI highly cited researchers on ResearchGate, and analyzes their specific information behaviors such as registration, information sharing and academic social networking by using the methods of network survey and comparative study. The results showed that 45.21% of ESI researchers have registered with ResearchGate while there are great differences among different disciplines. ESI researchers tend to sharing public information such as projects and research items. Meanwhile, ESI researchers tend to displaying personal information and obtaining academic information but make relatively little use of Q&A service. The spearman correlation tests show that information sharing behaviors have a strong correlation with researchers' influence while social interaction behaviors do not.

Optimization of the discipline layout of geophysics and space physics sciences in the National Natural Science Foundation of China,"In 2020, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) has conducted a systematic and comprehensive reorganization for upgrading the discipline layout and funding system. Correspondingly, the application code system of thediscipline of geophysics and space physics (DGSP, application code: D04) has been reviewed and carefully reorganized with forming a new application code system, according to the general regulation and proposal of the Department of Earth Sciences in NSFC. In the new system, the research directions are grouped into three major subjects, i.e., basic research, appliedresearch, as well as the frontier and interdisciplinary research. The basic research includes the general and traditional geodesy, solid geophysics and space physics; the applied research is mainly composed of the multiple directions of applied geophysics; and the planetary physics is highlighted as a frontier and interdisciplinary subject. On the other hand, the experimental techniques and instruments provide technical support for the scientific research of the whole DGSP. According to all these subjects and targets, the new application code system (D04) is subdivided into 14 secondary application codes. D0401 to D0403 cover the scope of geodesy, with three branches of physical geodesy, satellite geodesy and applied geodesy. D0404 to D0407 cover the solid geophysics, with four branches of seismology, geomagnetism and geo-electromagnetics, gravity, as well as physics of the Earth's interior and geodynamics (including geothermal science). Compared to the old version, the branches of magnetism and electricity studies are integrated into a new code of D0405, which will highlight the origin and evolution of the magnetic field of the Earth and other planets, the early nebulae of the solar system and other planets. Similarly, the new code of D0407 also combines several research branches in the old version, in order to integrate the relevant studies of the Earth's internal processes and their dynamic mechanism, as well as the geothermal condition and evolution. For the applied research, the new codes cover the three major fields of geophysical application, which are oil and gas (D0408), mineral resources (D0409), and engineering and environment (D0410), highlighting the contributions of geophysical research to the national economy. There is no significant adjustment in space physics, which still contains two secondary application codes (D0411 and D0412), covering all kinds of physical processes in solar terrestrial space and solar system space, as well as the influence of the sun and solar wind, magnetosphere, ionosphere and upper atmosphere on the human society. As a new research branch, planetary physics (D0413) is an independent secondary code, which focuses on the formation and evolution history of planets, including the inner layer structure, material state, composition, planetary space environment, middle and upper atmosphere environment, and surface environment. Finally, the research direction of experimental techniques and instruments (D0414) is still set as an independent secondary code, which focuses on all kinds of physical exploration instruments and experimental equipment, so as to provide technical support for the scientific research and development of DGSP. The new application code system firstly emphasizes the leading role played by the basic research disciplines, such as geophysics and space physics, in the innovation and frontiers of modern science and technology. Secondly, it highlights the applied research disciplines, i.e., applied geophysics, which should meet the general and major national demand, and strongly support the national economic development. Thirdly, it selects planetary physics as a key frontier and interdisciplinary research direction of Earth and Planetary sciences. The new application code system is configured with a clear position and goal for each discipline of DGSP. It covers more research areas and emphasizes both the interdisciplinary fields and the key fields in the future. The new system will contribute to the international competitiveness of geophysics and space physics of China, and further promote the development of planetary physics.

Trends and opportunities of tertiary education in safety engineering moving towards safety 4.0,"Industry and related work and workplaces are constantly changing as a result of the implementation of new technologies, substances and work processes, changes in the composition of the workforce and the labor market, and new forms of employment and work organization. The implementation of new technologies represents certain ambivalence. Next to the positive impact on workers’ health, new risks and challenges can arise in the area of process and occupational safety and health of people at work. On these bases, it follows the need for predicting and handling the new risks, in order to ensure safe and healthy workplaces in the future. The aim of most forecasting studies is not only to identify new emerging risks, but also to foresee changes that could affect occupational safety and health. However, a number of questions still require proper investigation, i.e., “What impact do new emerging risks have on tertiary education in the area of Safety engineering? Has tertiary education already reacted to progress in science and research and does it have these innovations in its syllabus? How are tertiary graduates prepared for the real world of new technologies?” This paper represents a first attempt in the literature to provide answers to the raised questions, by a survey approach involving academics, Health Safety and Environment (HSE) industrial experts and university students in the Czech Republic. Even if statistical evaluation is limited to a single Country and to a small sample size, the obtained results allow suggesting practical recommendations that can contribute to ensuring new challenges in the area of education by addressing relevant culture issues needed to support new workplace realities according to the newly defined Safety 4.0.",Laciok V.; Sikorova K.; Fabiano B.; Bernatik A.,Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2021-01-02,Università degli Studi di Genova;VSB – Technical University of Ostrava,Digital technologies and risk ;  Occupational safety and health ;  Process safety engineering ;  Safety 4.0 ;  Sustainable education

Bridging the gap between technology and culture: is CCS going to be part of our future?,"The slow development of CCS - Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage towards implementation can be seen from multiple perspectives, technological, economical, industrial, communication etc. With this contribution we have explored psychosocial aspects to get insights on how the relationships among stakeholders could improve, to overcome the conflicts that presently make it difficult to find wide societal support for the technology. Building on the outcomes of two studies, one for disseminating CCS to schoolchildren and a multi-stakeholder dialogue performed in ten European countries to develop a common vision for a low carbon society, we highlight the potential value of social environments that facilitate the need for Achievement and thus encourage mutual learning about energy technologies, including CCS, and constructive attitudes for the solution of environmental problems. We also illustrate how these experiences could change the way we look at apparently unsolvable issues and open new pathways for the energy transition and CCS future, through inclusive social processes which take into account the different perspectives to address issues such as competition of CCS with renewables or the bias in CCS evaluation, due to its association with fossil fuels.",Vercelli S.,Conference Proceeding,"15th Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies Conference 2021, GHGT 2021",2021-01-01,Sapienza Università di Roma,Achievement motive ;  CCS ;  CO2 storage ;  energy transition ;  just transition ;  Responsible Research and Innovation ;  stakeholder dialogue
"ETHICS in DESIGN EDUCATION, but DIFFERENT; PRACTICING the PRACTICAL TURN","Design education has looked for different approaches to teaching ethics and ethical behaviour. In this paper I want to add an approach that is coming from the collaboration between design research and philosophy of technology. Philosophy of Technology has produced a substantive number of theories and reflections about the impacts of technology and innovations on our daily lives and social behaviours. To make the reflections from philosophy of technology more tangible for design engineering students we experimented over the years with different tools and practical approaches in order to integrate these perspectives directly in the design process. In analogy with the empirical turn before, we named this closer integration with design ‘the Practical Turn in Philosophy of Technology’. My argument now is that by using these insights, one can cultivate ethical reflection with design engineering students by directly informing their design process in what I call ‘practicing the practical turn’. In this paper I will show this approach alongside the results of a one week workshop with a group of students from the University of Antwerp in the context of responsible design for public space.",Eggink W.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education, E and PDE 2021",2021-01-01,Universiteit Twente,Ethical reflection ;  Philosophy of technology ;  Practical turn ;  Responsible design ;  Social design
Additive technologies in military affairs,"In order to determine the features and main ways of using additive technologies within the framework of the scientific and business program of the International Military-Technical Forum “Army-2020”, a round table was held. In recent years, additive technologies have made a significant leap forward thanks to the improvement of electronic computing technology and software (software), the creation of a wide range of 3D printers that print using various modern methods and materials. The following industries are leading in the development of 3D printing as consumers: aircraft construction (33%), nuclear industry (30%), military-industrial complex (13%), as well as medicine (11%), education, etc. The summary contains part of the speeches of the speakers of the scientific event on the use of additive technologies in education and medicine. To achieve Russia’s position as one of the leaders in the global technology market, a network of educational institutions is developing and the provision of educational institutions with 3D printers. The country’s universities and, in particular, Bauman Moscow State Technical University began to develop professional competencies among graduates in the field of additive technologies, materials and equipment. Other universities use reverse engineering for research and development, the launch of new production. In medicine, models of complex elements of the human skeleton are created, in particular, individual bones and various projections of the skull, bones of the spine, hand and foot, as well as some models of organs from hard and semi-soft plastics to improve the educational process. The capabilities of 3D printing of mock-ups of organ pathologies are used for preoperative planning and rehearsal of an operation in thoracic and cardiovascular surgery, as well as for training students and doctors, modeling hemodynamics and testing medical devices. Alternative materials and methods for making splints and splints for fixing injuries and diseases of the upper limb are considered. To create ceramic products in dentistry, instead of injection molding and pressing, the technology of Lithography-based Ceramics Manufacturing printing with a suspension on foreign equipment was proposed. Three-dimension-al printing has partially filled the need for personal protective equipment against the new coronavirus infection, in particular through the creation of reusable masks, various adapters, holders of face masks, linings on door handles, etc. The participants of the round table agreed that the results of scientific and innovative activities in the field of additive technologies should be tested, implemented and used in the educational process, practical activities, including military medicine (bibl.: 6 refs).",Peleshok S.; Fisun A.; Morozov A.; Kalinin S.; Eliseeva M.,Journal,Russian Military Medical Academy Reports,2021-01-01,"Military Medical Academy, Saint Petersburg;Military Innovative Technopolis “ERA”",3D printing in medicine ;  additive technologies ;  education ;  innovations ;  medical devices ;  preoperative planning ;  software

The role of the sponsor to support the requirements engineering process in the search for external ideas in open innovation projects,"Presently, globalization is causing companies to be more competitive, and one of the ways this can be achieved is through the use of Open Innovation Projects (OIPs). Although considerable research has been devoted to Open Innovation (OI), rather less attention has been paid to how the OIP sponsor deals with limited resources to implement the requirements of the OIP. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the concerns and challenges that the sponsor has in supporting the requirements engineering (RE) process to meet the OIP requirements. A qualitative study was conducted to investigate five companies in the automotive, steel, oil, health and electric power industries. The findings show that there are differences between activities of the sponsor and the OIP team that help to characterize the problems that must be addressed by participants in an OIP. There is an evolving role for the sponsor to carry out the RE which is different from the OIP when the OIP first started. This is because the analysis of the requirements in OIP is constantly evolving during the project, and thinking about the requirements in the management phase of the OIP also needs to evolve to reach an innovative solution. The experiences shared here can help future OIP participants to better set requirements for their OIPs as well as to proactively address problems of inadequate collaboration, motivation, and empathy of the participants in OIPs.",Farias F.; da Gama K.; de Moura H.,Conference Proceeding,"Anais do Workshop em Engenharia de Requisitos 2021 - Proceedings of 24th Workshop on Requirements Engineering, WER 2021",2021-01-01,Universidade Federal de Pernambuco,Open innovation project ;  qualitative study ;  Requirements engineering

CO2 and H2S removal and gas sweetening in remote offshore locations is for the most part non-existent and CO2 is either being released into the atmosphere, within the acceptable operation limit of the platform, or being captured using conventional techniques with physical solvents such as in the selexol, rectisol, or sulfinol processes. Approximately 429.61 kg of CO2 exists in a 42-gallon barrel of distillate fuel oil and a CO2 coefficient of 0.0549 kg exists in 1 cubic foot of gas thereby emphasizing the need for an engineering solution on floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) units [1]. With strict regulation on greenhouse gases, it is increasingly paramount to utilize engineering measures to provide a contingency plan in mitigating carbon footprint with emerging novel technologies. The purpose of this study is to retrofit an existing FPSO with a CO2 capture plant; the efficiency of the capture plant, its capture capacity, and energy requirement based on experimental data will be thoroughly investigated during the scale up procedure. The research proceedings will require the use of a plethora of simulation suites which include Autodesk Fusion 360 for plant design. Further simulation will be carried out with numerical suites using Mathcad Prime 3.0 to study the scale up procedure from experimental to industrial sized adsorption unit complete with dimensions, energy requirement, capture capacity, and thermal values.Figure presented The FPSO in figure 1 above presented by (Araujo et al., 2016) indicates the availability of a capture plant as part of the process train on an FPSO. Efficiency loss contribution to the system may be deduced but also it is relevant to note the custom nature of the FPSO design being independent in its operation mode compared to other profiles. The availability of the stage compressors, dehydration units, and steam generation plant as part of the FPSO operation aid in minimising the need for additional equipment for the adsorption plant, however investigation has to be made on the redirecting of processes to serve the additional components highlighted above. Primary results have shown a low tendency for dual adsorption from the initial kinetic stoichiometric balance which could also be due to the force field parameters and charges affecting the active sites. For the current concept the fixed bed experimental model from the Research and Innovation Centre on CO2 and H2 is scaled up numerically to a fixed bed height of 6.56 feet, and filled with precipitated silica impregnated with PEI solution pressurized with CO2 inflow rated at 13 lb/hr at a fixed 1.2 Bar 60°C. The operational nature of the FPSO will be modified to account for the changes requested in gas sweetening and capture programs or enhanced oil recovery. Results from the simulation will also assist in providing a tangible and relatable understanding to the complexity of solid sorption technology integration within existing processing plants. The findings of this study will help comprehend the viability of an integrated adsorption plant within an existing process train. The efficiency of the plant operation for an oil production offshore facility with associated gas or for a standalone gas field will be addressed using a feasibility study conducted for the purpose of sustainable offshore operations.",Al Hajeri T.; Quang D.; Al Hajaj A.; Abu Zhara M.,Conference Proceeding,"15th Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies Conference 2021, GHGT 2021",2021-01-01,Phenikaa University;Khalifa University of Science and Technology,Adsorption ;  carbon capture ;  FPSO ;  natural gas sweetening ;  process simulation ;  sustainable operation ;  thermal analysis
Wyoming CarbonSAFE: advancing commercialization of low-carbon energy technologies in fossil-rich Wyoming,"Wyoming's Powder River Basin (PRB) is the most prolific coal producer and exporter in the United States and the State of Wyoming's largest oil-producing basin. In addition to being a leading energy producer, the PRB is the site of research programs whose aim is to develop and integrate low-carbon technologies into existing fossil fuel energy industries. Much of the PRB's low-carbon research is focused around Dry Fork Station (DFS), which is the newest coal-fired power station in the western US. Currently, DFS hosts five carbon capture projects, including pilot-scale capture projects that utilize different capture technologies and a full front-end engineering and design (FEED) study, a commercial CO2 pipeline for nearby CO2-enhanced oil recovery industry, and is also co-located with the Wyoming Integrated Test Center, which is a host facility for unconventional carbon utilization research (i.e. flue gas carbon-to-products innovations). DFS is also the host site for the Wyoming CarbonSAFE project. Wyoming CarbonSAFE, funded by the Department of Energy/National Energy Technology Laboratory, is a multi-phased program (currently in Phase II) whose core objective is developing and validating storage sites within a complex capable of storing 50 million metric tonnes of CO2 over a 30 year project period using carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS). This paper will provide an overview of the project to-date, showing that CarbonSAFE goals are achievable with respect to geologic, environmental, regulatory, CO2 source and economic conditions, and why the State of Wyoming offers one of the more favorable environments to advance the commercialization studies. In 2019, the project team designed and completed a ~10,000 foot stratigraphic test well just south of DFS. From this well, the team collected over 600 feet of core, fluid samples from target injection zones, and a full petrophysical log suite. In addition, legacy 2D seismic lines were acquired and a 3D seismic survey was acquired in the fall of 2020. The objective of these field activities has been to identify and characterize target storage reservoirs and associated caprock. This complex has several reservoirs that could meet commercial injection goals, and over 4000 feet of associated caprock. Simulations of site performance suggest that stacked injection provides the most effective storage strategy, and would necessitate several sites within the greater complex to meet final project injection goals. Other work within this project includes the development of a business-case around proximal fields with CO2-enhanced oil recovery potential and existing tax credits, assessment of regulatory conditions, including pore space ownership and Class VI injection well permitting requirements, implementation of a robust public outreach program, and surface site characterization activities that have focused on environmental factors. In the PRB and at DFS, the State of Wyoming and other entities have made carbon management a priority of its future energy industry by providing a regulatory and business framework that is favorable to advancing these technologies. These endeavors will become more realistic with the successful implementation of Wyoming CarbonSAFE, and its ability to secure and validate commercial-scale CCUS at the center of Wyoming's premier low-carbon research efforts.",McLaughlin J.; Quillinan S.; Coddington K.; Ganshin Y.; Phillips E.; Jiao Z.; Wang H.; Johnson M.; Bagdonas D.; Nye C.; Bosshart N.; Oster B.,Conference Proceeding,"15th Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies Conference 2021, GHGT 2021",2021-01-01,University of North Dakota;University of Wyoming,Carbon Capture ;  CCUS ;  Class VI wells ;  CO2-EOR ;  Geologic Storage ;  Wyoming

IDENTIFYING INDUSTRY NEEDS FOR INNOVATION SKILLS IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION: A THEMATIC ANALYSIS OF CASES FROM DANISH INDUSTRY,"Providing students with knowledge, skills, and competencies in innovation has become a central focus in engineering education. However, there is limited knowledge on which innovation skills need to be supported and how well engineering education meets current knowledge gaps in the industry. As a first step towards addressing this research question, our paper presents findings from examining 49 innovation cases provided by Danish industries for the Applied Innovation in Engineering (AIE) course at Aarhus University. A thematic analysis was conducted to identify dominant trends from the case descriptions and to assess areas of interest and demands from different industry sectors. Results identify areas of interest from the cases that correspond to desired innovation skills in three primary aspects (i) technology/product, (ii) digitalization, and (ii) sustainability, and five secondary aspects: (a) future trends, (b) customer behaviour, (c) business, (d) regulations, and (e) training. This study provides valuable insights on needs from the Danish industry and the areas of interest to which innovation skills are required, therefore supporting EE in integrating industry-oriented competencies for engineering students.",Kunrath K.; Leka S.; Abu-Ghaida H.; Ramanujan D.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the SEFI 49th Annual Conference: Blended Learning in Engineering Education: Challenging, Enlightening - and Lasting?",2021-01-01,Aarhus Universitet,Engineering education ;  Industry ;  Innovation ;  Sustainability
INTEGRATED CLASSROOM LEARNING: HOW TO CREATE AN ACTIVATING AND SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR ONLINE LEARNING IN KNOWLEDGE EXCHANGE AND INNOVATION EDUCATION FOR ENGINEERING STUDENTS,"The Covid-19 pandemic posed significant challenges for educators in higher education institutions to develop and implement online teaching formats at very short notice. Those challenges were felt especially in small courses such as tutorials or seminars that strongly rely on the close interaction and lively discussions among participants. In small courses students effectively develop future-oriented competencies. In order to foster learning, educators need to create an environment in which students can acquire the necessary knowledge exchange skills, innovation methods, and an entrepreneurial mindset. That requires new approaches to online teaching/learning. Educators need to use interactive learning formats to achieve those learning outcomes, yet they often lack the relevant tools or guidance. Drawing on the experience of the past three 'creative semesters' (State Secretary for Science and Research in Berlin Krach), my paper develops four steps that educators can take to establish digital classrooms as safer spaces for students and teaching staff alike. The concept of safer spaces (Schutzraum) originated from gender-aware youth work in the 1970s. I adapt this concept to higher education didactics to address challenges for online teaching/learning by creating an activating and encouraging learning environment. Safer spaces can provide a framework in which students and educators interact openly. As the result of mutual respect and trust, the online classroom environment becomes a key factor in fostering deep learning.",Johannsen T.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the SEFI 49th Annual Conference: Blended Learning in Engineering Education: Challenging, Enlightening - and Lasting?",2021-01-01,Technische Universität Berlin,Activating teaching and learning ;  blended learning ;  Covid-19 ;  integrated classroom learning ;  knowledge exchange training ;  online learning ;  pandemic ;  pedagogy ;  safer space ;  transfer skills

ANALYSIS OF THE EVOLUTION OF A STEAM LECTURER-TRAINING PROGRAM BASED ON COMPETENCIES IN AN HYBRID CONTEXT,"The objective of this work is to present an innovative lecturer's training program developed at UPC-BarcelonaTech while transitioning to a semi-presential hybrid scenario due to the pandemic. This “Postgraduate Degree in University Teaching in STEAM” was designed based on the teaching competencies that a lecturer should possess in Engineering-related subjects. Focus was placed on a final project to help lecturers implement innovations in class with their students. When the confinement due to the pandemic started, it was evident that many lecturers had a clear deficit on digital competencies to conduct their teaching on-line. This paper presents an analysis on the changes undertaken in the program after a year of hybrid teaching, their impact on the teachers and on the participants of the program. A more flexible syllabus, the addition of digital education courses for lecturers, and a more research-oriented program are important factors that have improved the quality of the program. Results show that participation in the courses offered during this exceptional period radically increased for some areas such as digital on-line technologies for education, while the egressed number of participants did not change significantly from previous editions. Specific recommendations are provided for Engineering Education programs, as the perception of the importance of some of these competences by the instructors are found to be significantly different among different STEAM fields of knowledge. Valuable lessons have been learned in this process, with some of the changes undertaken having a good prospect to stay in the near future.",Perez-Poch A.; Alcober J.; Alier M.; Prat J.; Llorens A.; López D.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the SEFI 49th Annual Conference: Blended Learning in Engineering Education: Challenging, Enlightening - and Lasting?",2021-01-01,Universitat Politécnica de Catalunya,digital education ;  soft skills ;  STEAM education ;  teacher training
DEVELOPMENT OF ONLINE LEARNING PRACTICES IN A JAPANESE UNIVERSITY BASED ON THE QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEYS,"This study aims to clarify the development of online learning practice of engineering education in a Japanese university under the pandemic of the COVID-19. The research question is how online learning, especially blended learning, was practiced. By 2020, advances in Internet technology and its widespread use had already formed the basis for online classes. However, face-to-face classes were the mainstream, and there were few online classes for undergraduate education. We will present the development of online learning at a Japanese university, which is a private technical university in the bay area of Tokyo, Japan, as an example. This university had conducted all classes online in the first semester of 2020. The transition to online classes was unexpected, and classes started in May, a month late. In the second semester, some classes were face-to-face, while many classes were online. We will present: 1. how progressed the teaching style to blended learning, 2. how changed the students' understanding of classes, 3. how changed the students' satisfaction level of classes. The significant difference is that blended learning started in the second semester. The understanding and satisfaction of the students have improved in the second semester. The background of this development is also that the faculty, administrators, and students collaborated to work on education innovation.",Aihara S.; Suzuki H.; Tsunoda K.; Hoshi Y.; Inoue M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the SEFI 49th Annual Conference: Blended Learning in Engineering Education: Challenging, Enlightening - and Lasting?",2021-01-01,Shibaura Institute of Technology,COVID-19 ;  Faculty survey ;  Online/blended learning ;  Student survey
Adding Necessary Rigor to Engineering Pedagogical Change: Instructional Innovation Versus Research-Informed Counter-Resistance,"In this study, we explore the teaching of an acclaimed engineering education professor and his struggles to transform his classroom in light of the National Academy of Engineering standards. We argue that pedagogical changes, particularly in contexts where students have been highly successful, may be preemptively abandoned in response to students’ floundering. We offer three instances in which direct counterresistance to students’ responses to pedagogical innovation allowed this expert instructor to achieve his long-term goal of students’ higherlevel thinking.

Spatial Planning and Design for Resilience: The Case of Pearl River Delta,"Pearl River Delta (abbreviated as the PRD) has become a pioneer region in China since the Reform and Open-door policy in 1978. After more than 40 years of rapid urbanization, the PRD has made remarkable improvements in its economic development. The PRD is one of three urban agglomerations, and it has the characteristics of the largest population concentration, the strongest innovation and the strongest comprehensive strength in China. At the same time, we should also be aware that the rapid economic development makes the land resources in the PRD scarce, and the role of the natural base layer has been ignored during the process of urbanization. Issues such as the extensive use of land resources, the fragmentation of the blue-green networks, the disorderly reclamation of sea areas, and the shrinkage of tidal flats alongside estuaries, etc. make the natural base layer of the PRD vulnerable. In recent decades, natural disasters, such as flooding, land subsidence, typhoon, and storm surges which occurred in the PRD have become more varied, frequent and destructive than those in other regions. The future spatial development of the PRD is highly uncertain. Faced with the highly overlapping factors of the external disturbances - natural disasters caused by extreme climate change, and internal interactions - the contradiction between natural conditions and rapid urbanization, traditional spatial planning and design used to pursue economic development could not be flexible enough to respond to the dynamic and uncertain future of the PRD. In the future, spatial planning and design should pay great attention to the fragile natural base layer and unexpected external disturbances that will negatively impact the PRD caused by natural disasters, such as flooding and land subsidence situation. Therefore, it is of great theoretical and practical significance to research for a possible alternative approach to maintain the health of the natural base layer and to better adapt to the condition of climate change through spatial planning and design for resilience. On the basis of an extensive study of current literatures, this doctoral dissertation deeply analyzes the current spatial system, previous planning and design practices of the PRD, as well as the case studies of the relevant spatial planning and design practices in other deltas in America and the Netherlands. Based on the idea of spatial resilience, the combination of ‘theoretical research and empirical validation’ is applied as the streamline of this research. The main theoretical attributes are researched, including the core capacities pursued by spatial planning and design for resilience, the fundamental thinking characteristics of spatial planning and design for resilience, and the main spatial characteristics of resilience presented by planning and design. The knowledge obtained from the theory and the method is applied to the further empirical research of spatial planning and design for a resilient PRD. The research question of this doctoral dissertation is ‘What are the theories and methods of spatial planning and design for resilience? How is it possible to apply the theory and method of spatial planning and design for resilience to the PRD?’. Based on that, this doctoral dissertation carries out a systematic research from four parts: theory, method, application and conclusion. The main research contents of this doctoral dissertation are as followings. 1 In order to understand the background of the PRD, literatures on exploring the physical context, the crucial stages of spatial transformation, as well as spatial planning and design practices of the PRD are reviewed. Spatial planning and design of typical deltas in America and the Netherlands are also studied from the perspective of both theory and practices, which can be applied as case reference. 2 The theory of spatial planning and design for resilience is systematically researched. Based on the analysis of the development of the concept of resilience, the meaning of resilience in this doctoral dissertation is explained. The core capacities pursued by spatial planning and design for resilience, the fundamental thinking characteristics of spatial planning and design for resilience, the main spatial characteristics of resilience presented by planning and design, and the internal thinking logic of the approach of spatial planning and design for resilience are systematically researched. The reasons why these characteristics can help to improve the capacity of resilience of a spatial system is explained in details. This doctoral dissertation systematically puts forward that the ‘robustness and adaptability’ are two core capacities pursued by spatial planning and design for resilience, the ‘systematic, collaborative, bottom-line and foresight thinking’ are four fundamental thinking characteristics of spatial planning and design for resilience, the ‘regionality, connectivity, diversity, multifunctionality, redundancy and modularization’ are six spatial characteristics of resilience presented by planning and design. It points out that the approach of spatial planning and design for resilience need to pay more attention to expound the understanding of driving forces such as nature, ecology, society and economy, and to emphasize that spatial development of the PRD must be built on basis that enough land carrying capacity can be provided and harmonious human-nature relationships can be established, based on a comprehensive grasp of the natural base layer and socio-economic development trends. 3 Implementation method for spatial planning and design for resilience is provided. Guided by the theory of spatial planning and design for resilience, this doctoral dissertation focuses on the way to transform the theoretical knowledge into the implementation method that can be conducted by spatial planning and design. The dissertation proposes a guiding ideology of spatial planning and design (process based) for resilience and explains its implementation principle, organization, and technical route. The key phases such as target determination, system interpretation, system projection, planning and design for resilience, evaluation and feedback are established. The operational guidelines of spatial planning and design for resilience are put forward. 4 The empirical research of the theory and method of spatial planning and design for resilient PRD is conducted and possible new schemes are produced. This doctoral dissertation takes the situation of huge precipitation and sea level rise caused by extreme climate change as external disturbances, and systematically analyses spatial status, spatial evolution and existing main problems in the PRD. Based on the projection of the future scenario under the condition of extreme climate change, the corresponding principles and strategies of spatial planning and design for the resilient PRD are researched in terms of land use, blue-green networks and coastline. From the perspective of land use, it proposes that future resilient land-uses distribution needs to combine the results of land-use suitability assessment. The possible new scheme of land use that consists of the spatial characteristics of ‘three-circle coordinated space, four categories of land use’ is put forward. From the perspective of blue-green networks, the possible new scheme is suggested by integrating regional natural environmental resources and creating cross-regional hydrological-ecological corridors, based on the technical assistance of minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model. From the perspective of the coastline, the possible new scheme of coastline is provided with the contents of arranging the coastline function and creating coastline buffering belt, based on the technical assistance of coastline development suitability assessment. 5 The corresponding principles and strategies of resilient flood control and drainage on Hengli Island are proposed. Hengli Island is the most important core area of the Pearl Bay in the PRD. With the continuous urbanization on the island, the coordination between urbanization and water environment is very prominent. According to the theory and method of spatial planning and design for resilience, a new approach that can better lead the site to adapt to future climate change condition is proposed by widely applying the spatial characteristics of resilience that can be presented by planning and design, such as regionality, connectivity, diversity, multifunctionality, redundancy and modularization. Principles and strategies with modularized water collective units, improved water networks, classified inner-river functions, diversified and multifunctional water storage spots, appropriate dykes’ height, appropriate distance between dyke and shoreline, and multifunctional shorelines, etc. are proposed. Water level management measurements in different scenarios including regulation, self-drainage and artificial-extraction with the combination of nature-based work and civil engineering are proposed. The new scheme of resilient flood control and drainage can integrate the function of both flood control and drainage and landscape-viewing together.",Dai W.,Book Series,A+BE Architecture and the Built Environment,2021-01-01,South China University of Technology,Climate change ;  Pearl River Delta ;  Principle and Strategy ;  Resilience ;  Spatial planning and design

New Opportunities with Paper Mill Pulpers,"This presentation will highlight new innovations aimed at simplifying process solutions and eliminating the need for many traditional unit processes such as secondary pulper, coarse screening, HC cleaners and reject drums in recycled fiber lines. This leads to lower total investments, less energy consumption, less operating costs and reduced climate emissions together with higher fiber yield. Recycled paper contains various impurities which have to be removed from pulp. Hard and heavy particles cause wearing of the process equipment and the most economical way is to remove these impurities as soon as possible. Light rejects tend to rotate above the vortex made by rotor and they have to be continuously removed. Traditionally there are several equipment needed to remove all these different rejects, but it can also be done in a simpler way. Usually there are easily degradable material and material which is difficult to disintegrate in the recycled paper. It is known many cases where the disintegration time is too short for the material with higher wet-strength and this material ends up in reject. New process innovation makes it possible to extend the disintegration time for the most difficult fibers meanwhile the energy consumption can be kept lower than traditionally. These new innovations presented at this paper are result of long-term research and engineering work. They make possible to improve efficiency of old pulpers and also building whole new pulping lines where coarse screening of pulp happens inside the pulper are possible.",Antila G.,Journal,IPPTA: Quarterly Journal of Indian Pulp and Paper Technical Association,2021-01-01,PR-Pulping Oy,Cleaning ;  Pulping ;  Recycled paper ;  Reject handling ;  Screening

New Large-Scale 750-Bar Oxygen Pressure Surge Test Facility,"The oxygen pressure surge test (OPST) is considered to be best practice for evaluating the burnout safety of plant components and testing the compatibility of nonmetallic materials for oxygen service. Nevertheless, there are only a few laboratories worldwide performing the OPST. The Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing (BAM) already operates oxygen pressure surge test facilities with maximum OPST pressures of 450 bars. However, to ensure technical innovation and to enhance research and development, the decision was made to develop a new and large-scale oxygen pressure surge test facility. Because of its size and the high potential impact energies, the test facility is located outside of Berlin at the BAM Test Site for Technical Safety, where large-scale testing is carried out. In addition to an intended maximum OPST pressure of 750 bars, there is the possibility of testing industrial equipment with large inner volumes and diameters. The new quick opening valve constitutes the core of the system and was developed by BAM. It allows performing tests with the standardized pressure rise times of 15-20 ms or with adjustable pressure rise times at higher or lower values. As a result, it is possible to provide customized test parameters for specific practical applications as well as research projects. This paper shows the status quo of this unique test facility, its performance, its technical specifications, and its new possibilities for research and development for a long-term enhancement of burnout safety in oxygen applications.",Woitzek A.; Kittler-Packmor K.; Kasch T.,Conference Proceeding,ASTM Special Technical Publication,2021-01-01,Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -Prüfung,adiabatic compression ;  adjustable pressure rise time ;  burnout safety ;  innovation in OPST facility ;  oxygen pressure surge test

On Corporate Innovation,"The dominant consensus among all generations, ethnicities, geographies and professions is that it is desirable to have more innovation not less. McKinsey says executives don’t want more of science, research, operation, engineering or clever business models but more innovation, as it is critical for their business growth (McKinsey, Growth and innovation. Strategy and corporate finance, 2020). Can it be perhaps that the innovation we are after is a placeholder for unexpected, positive, surprising new improvements of how we operate today? This chapter demystifies innovation and anchors it’s core in ubiquitous business concepts accessible to everyone. It then shows how leading companies in their field apply these concepts in their daily product reality.",Paraschiv V.,Book Series,Management for Professionals,2021-01-01,,
Improving Crop Physio-Biochemical Efficiency and Abiotic Resilient Crops for Alleviating Food Insecurity in Africa,"The current food security situation in Africa is in a precarious situation that demands urgent need to prioritise innovative and adaptive crop research efforts towards producing sufficient food need comparable with 0.73% population growth rate. We review the causes, manifestation and possible scientific approaches to improving crop efficiencies towards improving African food insecurity situation. This review focuses on the need to improve physio-biochemical aspects of important cereal and legume crops by optimising their agronomic efficiencies predicated by unpredictable climatic variables. The relevance of introgression of selected abiotic tolerant traits for sustainable crop growth under climate change phenomenon into economic crops via modern genetic techniques was discussed. Equally, we discussed how breeding varieties that are efficient in utilizing nutrient on marginal soils typical of African farmlands, application of genetically modified crops and nanofertilizers technologies could address increasing Africa’s food deficit. Understanding how crop physiological parameters relevant to improving yield and its components and how these could be manipulated to increase food security were elucidated. The importance of hybridizing early maturity traits and excellent root system for improving drought tolerance and crop yield was expatiated. The value of improving conversion efficiency through leaf chlorophyll and canopy architecture engineering was elaborated.",Dada O.; Kutu F.; Mavengahama S.,Book,Food Security and Safety: African Perspectives,2021-01-01,University of Mpumalanga;North-West University;University of Ibadan,Agricultural innovations ;  Canopy architecture ;  Climatic variables ;  Conversion efficiency ;  Physio-biochemical efficiency

Carbon Emission Characteristics of Inclined Shaft Construction in Highway Tunnel,"Although the existing studies have conducted a lot of analysis on the carbon emission characteristics of the main tube of the tunnel (Ahn et al. in Construction research congress 2010: innovation for reshaping construction practice proceedings of the 2010 construction research congress, 2010; Li et al. in Mod Tunn Technol 52:17, 2015; Li et al. in ISWREP 2011 Proceedings of 2011 international symposium on water resource and environmental protection, 2011), there are few literature reports on the carbon emission characteristics of the inclined shaft of the tunnel. The inclined shaft is an important auxiliary tunnel for the construction of a long tunnel, which plays an important role in shortening the construction period of the project and speeding up the construction progress. Relying on engineering cases, this project analyzes the carbon emission characteristics during the construction of inclined shafts of highway tunnels, clarifies the carbon emission levels during the different construction processes, and explores the influence law of inclined shaft slope and length on the carbon emissions during excavation and slagging.",,Book,Carbon Emission Calculation Methods for Highway Tunnel Construction,2021-01-01,,
A Pilot Epidemiological Exploration of Regenerative Dentistry From the Perspective of Active Clinicians Working in the UK,"Innovation has always been part of dentistry and with that comes thinking outside the box to produce guidelines for implementation of new approaches. Regenerative dentistry (RD) is a young specialty within the profession, which gathers knowledge from stem cells, molecular biology, and tissue and material engineering to produce and apply novel biologically based therapies. Since RD is an emerging branch of dentistry, it is not yet understood whether active clinicians are aware of this field and know exactly what it does. The aim of this study is to explore the awareness, understanding, and beliefs about RD of active dentists. A random selection of active dentists in the UK was approached via e-mail and face-to-face and asked to fill in a questionnaire. A total of 45 responses were received and analyzed. The results showed that active dentists in the UK are aware of the field but are not prepared to apply personalized biologically based therapies and feel a desire to educate themselves about RD further. Also, the results shine a light on the opportunities for regulatory and educational bodies to work together to prepare the clinicians for this novel field. Our research suggests that active dentists are ill-prepared for an era of personalized biologically based dental treatments. Further thinking of how to implement basic and more advanced biological knowledge and their application in dentistry is needed, and suggestions are made here.",Neves V.; Jamal H.,Journal,Frontiers in Dental Medicine,2021-01-01,University College London;King's College London,dental education ;  education ;  policymaking ;  regenerative dentistry ;  stem cells ;  translation
I know it – I like it – I buy it! The role of knowledge for the adoption of battery-electric and hydrogen vehicles,"Although research in different disciplines has demonstrated that education and information can lead to more sustainable attitudes and related behaviour, supporting the assumptions of Roger’s Diffusion of Innovation Theory, other research points to a knowledge-behaviour gap. Thus, we shed light on the question of whether knowledge can help to accelerate the adoption of transport innovations and under which conditions. Specifically, this research paper extends the current findings regarding the knowledge-attitude-behaviour process in the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) by focusing on different types of knowledge and including the adoption of hydrogen-powered fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEVs).We present two empirical studies from Germany – one on the adoption of electric vehicles by employees (n = 1,174) assessing potential differences in subjective and objective knowledge and one on the adoption of EVs and FCEVs in the general population (n = 1,344) assessing differences in knowledge regarding the innovation’s diffusion phase. Using mediation analyses, the results of both studies support the theoretical assumption and the expected process: Knowledge has a positive impact on the adoption intention of EVs and FCEVs; this effect is mediated by individuals’ attitudes toward the technological innovation. Regardless of the innovation’s diffusion phase, greater knowledge leads to a more positive attitude towards the innovation, and a more positive attitude leads to a higher adoption intention of the technological innovations. The effect appears stable: It remains for subjective and objective knowledge (Study 1), for different measures of adoption intention (Study 1 and Study 2) as well as for different technological innovations in the transport sector which are in different diffusion phases (Study 2). Details of the results, their impact for implementing new technologies in other areas as well as the role of the media will be discussed.",Preuß S.; Scherrer A.,Conference Proceeding,Eceee Summer Study Proceedings,2021-01-01,Rheinland-Pfälzische Technische Universität Kaiserslautern-Landau;Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research ISI,adoption ;  alternative vehicles ;  behavioural change ;  electric vehicles ;  hydrogen ;  knowledge ;  technological innovations

TOMORROW'S CHALLENGES FOR TODAY'S STUDENTS: CHALLENGE-BASED LEARNING AND INTERDISCIPLINARITY,"TU/e innovation Space offers an environment for students to work in interdisciplinary teams on societal problems. These problems ask for development of a shared language for interdisciplinary collaboration and to facilitate learning processes. Little is known about design characteristics for these problems, and what is needed to support interdisciplinarity in student teams. The educational concept Challenge-based learning (CBL) uses authentic societal problems ('challenges') to urge student learning. The main research question for this case study is: What design characteristics of innovation Space challenges support interdisciplinary student collaboration? Data collection consisted of analysis of learning materials, interviews with teachers and students, student surveys about motivation and collaborative learning in four courses and two honour's tracks. The results show how teachers ask for competence development in supporting students, especially in assessing and integrating discipline knowledge. Students reported high motivation combined with anxiety for open and complex challenges. Over time this anxiety decreases, as students develop knowledge to solve the challenge. Students also reported a need for a clear mapping of learning goals to activities and assessment. For students it appeared often unclear how and on what criteria they are assessed. Yet, students also reported support in developing ownership, self-directed learning, and collaborative learning. This study confirms existing literature that emphasises difficulties in students developing rigorous discipline knowledge in CBL and interdisciplinary assessment. This study increases our understanding of challenge design and how interdisciplinarity can be situated in this design. It offers starting points for research on motivation and collaborative learning in CBL.",van den Beemt A.; MacLeod M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the SEFI 49th Annual Conference: Blended Learning in Engineering Education: Challenging, Enlightening - and Lasting?",2021-01-01,Technische Universiteit Eindhoven;Universiteit Twente,
VARIETY IN CHALLENGE-BASED LEARNING IN HIGHER EDUCATION,"Increasingly higher education programs are made open and flexible to face challenges demanded by societal changes. Challenge-based learning (CBL) is perceived as an educational concept shaping these open and flexible programs. However, CBL as a field of research is still in its infancy. The present study searches for all-embracing commonalities of CBL in engineering education. We propose an evaluative framework that both includes commonalities and allows for variety in CBL characteristics between study components. This framework, labelled CBL-compass, serves as a methodological approach for educational staff and researchers to visualise the local colour of CBL in higher education institutions. With this study we aim to advance the field by contributing to a conceptual basis in flexibility in CBL. Our research question was: How can we assess the variety of CBL implementations in engineering education experiments? This question was answered by an evaluative case study. First, existing literature on CBL was scoped. The characteristics following from this review were perceived as dimensions, each with associated indicators. Empirical data were collected from an evaluation of six CBL experiments. The variety of scores on the CBL-compass gave an impression of how teachers implemented CBL in their course or project and can thus be used as an evaluation mechanism to improve this implementation. Filling in the CBL-compass triggered reflection among teachers about their course and CBL. The added value of the CBL-compass is the attention for, amongst others assessment or teacher skills and support, which are important for the overall quality of study components.",van den Beemt A.; van den Watering G.; Bots M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the SEFI 49th Annual Conference: Blended Learning in Engineering Education: Challenging, Enlightening - and Lasting?",2021-01-01,Technische Universiteit Eindhoven,challenge-based learning ;  educational innovation ;  evaluative case study ;  higher education

CDIO APPROACH IN DEVELOPING SOLUTION MINDED LEARNERS,"From its early days as the first polytechnic in Singapore, Singapore Polytechnic (SP) has been working closely with the government to train and arm the workforce with the skills needed for the country’s economic growth. As the pace of globalisation accelerated in the 80s to 90s, the strategic policy was implemented to strengthen and drive towards becoming an innovation economy. This strategy led to the setting up of research and innovation centres in the local Institutes of Higher Learning (IHL) such as SP. In SP, the Civil Engineering course is one of the first engineering courses that offers a broad-based engineering discipline. The School of Architecture and the Built Environment (ABE) is the first school to offer built environment related courses, including the civil engineering course, before being a coordinator of training for the Building and Construction sector among the five local polytechnics. As an applied learning institution, ABE Civil Engineering has adopted the CDIO approach allowing staff and students to engage in real-life and industry relevant research projects to enable the application of knowledge and the use of CDIO skills to conceptualize, design and develop industry relevant solutions. Such engagement in real-life and industry research project settings enable students in their final year projects (FYP) to directly contribute to real-life such industry projects, while building their proficiency to become solution-minded learners who are both innovative and have a curious mindset.This paper describes the integrated learning process of how the adoption of CDIO approach can be realised with staff in close collaboration with the industry to pursue industry relevant solutions. This integrated learning experience (CDIO Standard 7) can foster the learning of disciplinary knowledge simultaneously with solution-minded strategies.This collaboration with the industry explores the journey that ABE has taken from concept, design to development of its green masterplan, to its evolution and establishment of focus on green technology research that expose students to such research areas through their (FYP) involvement. Two research projects of recycling of palm frond into bioplastic, and also of incinerator ash to aerogel materials, will be utilised to show how these FYP student activities help students to be solution-minded in their approaches. Feedbacks were collected through face-to-face interviews with the two groups of students to identify challenges and propose improvements to facilitate the integrated learning experiences.

"Exploring the Potential of Below Ground Microbiome: Mechanism of Action, Applications, and Commercial Challenges","Rhizospheric microorganisms affect the plant community and their composition in a particular niche in a larger way. The population density of below ground microbes acts as an indicator for above ground richness of flora and fauna. These PGPR affect the plants in a positive way through their direct and indirect plant growth promoting actions. Plant communicates with their associated microbial community through chemical signaling with the help of various signaling molecules. The knowledge of plant microbe interaction and communication has been greatly increased over the year. Due to the functional potential of these microorganisms and depleting crop production, it is utmost necessary to convert laboratory innovation into the potential commercial products. A huge amount of work has been done and still going on pertaining to microbial research using single microbes or the combination of two or more microbes, known as consortia. But the problem with these products lies with their efficacy in varying ecological conditions and the product shelf life in adverse environmental conditions. It is a high time when focus must be shifted towards the knowledge driven selection of suitable strains as well as development of suitable carrier and robust formulations. The current chapter signifies the importance of PGPR, their mechanism of action, advantage of microbial consortia, aspect of consortia engineering and their various applications.

Bony contouring in head and neck microvascular reconstruction,"Head and neck reconstruction has evolved substantially in the last three decades to rely heavily on microvascular free tissue transfer, including bony composite flaps that improve form and functional outcomes. The technologies available for planning and executing bony reconstruction have undergone concurrent innovation, leaving the modern surgeons with a host of options to consider. In this review, the techniques of external fixation, virtual surgical planning and rapid prototyping are discussed with the aim of familiarizing surgeons and comparing these approaches. External fixation, though not new to head and neck surgery, has seen a revival and has considerable utility in vascularized bony reconstruction with the potential for improved efficiency and cost control. We explore the clinical situations in which virtual surgical planning is best employed, and the varying levels to which it can be applied throughout the reconstructive process. The ever-expanding realm of rapid prototyping, or 3D printing, is also examined to explore potential applications for surgical modeling, tissue engineering and even clinical training. Finally, we present a discussion of the cost-effectiveness of the technologies and future directions for research in the field.",Kain J.; Birkeland A.; Bewley A.,Journal,Plastic and Aesthetic Research,2021-01-01,UC Davis School of Medicine,external fixation ;  Head and neck ;  microvascular reconstruction ;  rapid prototyping ;  virtual surgical planning
Innovation to Reduce Operation Downtime in Sulfate Removal Offshore Applications,"Sulfate removal in injection water is standard practice to prevent scaling and souring in subsea oil reservoirs. Nanofiltration membranes have been used to this purpose since 1987, when FilmTec™ SR90-400 elements were installed in an offshore platform in the North Sea. The most pressing concern in this type of systems is membrane fouling, with the associated reduction in effective plant operation time and shorten element lifespan caused by the standard Clean-in-Place (CIP) protocols. The object of this research has been to test the latest developments in biofouling-resistant sulfate removal membranes to achieve oil and gas (O&G) industry requirements. Improved chemistry and improved module engineering have enabled the production of new membrane elements that represent the next-generation in sulfate removal nanofiltration. Next-generation sulfate removal membranes have been trial-tested. In pilot testing, target performance was validated in terms of productivity, permeate quality and fouling resistance. The results of this testing indicate that improvements in membrane chemistry and module engineering have resulted in a 63% decrease in pressure drop and a much slower fouling trend over the total of 6 elements. This significant improvement should allow an important reduction in the number of cleanings, which the authors have estimated to be of 50%. Moreover, sulfate rejection values are in the range of 99.9% (below 1 ppm of sulfate in the permeate), providing great injection-quality water. Full-scale testing in a production site in the Atlantic Ocean was done to validate pilot testing results, showing a continued operation of 100 days without any need for a clean-in-place (CIP) procedure. The results obtained in the extensive testing carried out on these new antifouling elements, show that the improvements implemented in its design have the ability to improve the operation of Sulfate Removal Units (SRU). These improvements are the results of reducing maintenance costs and downtime on offshore platforms, resulting in increased operation and improved productivity.",Cuenca Y.; Tejero À.; Das S.; Brooke-Peig D.; Martin P.; Bechir F.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the Annual Offshore Technology Conference,2021-01-01,DuPont,

Beyond planned learning objectives: Entrepreneurial education as the source of accidental competencies for engineering students,"CONTEXT A growing number of educational institutions and professional associations are emphasizing the importance of an entrepreneurial mindset and competencies in engineers and other technical professionals. The inclusion of entrepreneurship education components in engineering activities contributes to the development of technological innovations, which are aimed at solving essential social and human problems. However, despite the value of entrepreneurship education for engineers, there are limited approaches to evaluation that consider the complexity of the learning process and emerging practices. PURPOSE OR GOAL The purpose of this study is to understand the competencies that engineering students develop through participation in entrepreneurial educational activities. The learning process of engineering students was investigated through the lens of Accidental Competency Formation concept. Additionally, in this study, the authors evaluated how the chosen theoretical lenses provide understanding about the role of specific learning activities in forming students' competences. APPROACH OR METHODOLOGY/METHODS The authors followed the interpretive methodology and used in-depth semi-structured interviews as the data collection method. This research is qualitative and serves as a reminder of importance of students' perceptions and beliefs in understanding the effect of educational interventions on students' formation. Data was collected from 11 engineering students, who participated in the UTS Techcelerator 2020 program, which is a deep tech early-stage accelerator designed to promote prototyping skills for technology students. ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES The main outcome of the study is the elicitation of the three different accidental competencies such as self-regulation, adaptability and empathy, which are formed in the engineering students participating in entrepreneurial activities. Additionally, сertain activities and elements of the Techcelerator program educational process were identified as having a particular impact on the formation of competencies, based on students' accounts. CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS/SUMMARY This study provides a holistic approach that allows evaluating the role of entrepreneurial activities in the formation of engineering students' competencies, considering the complexity of the learning process.

Entrepreneurially-Minded Program Assessment During Emergency Situations: Using Photovoice to Understand Customer (Engineering Student) Needs,"CONTEXT: Innovation, design, and entrepreneurship are economic drivers promoting competition and growth throughout the world, many of which would not exist without well-established continuous improvement and new product development processes. Continuous improvement and new product development processes, such as the lean start-up methodology and design thinking, are well known and thriving in the business world due to the vast amount of empirically-grounded research. Unfortunately, educational institutions and researchers, alike, are lagging when it comes to these processes. Although the quantity of new and transformative degree offerings has increased substantially over the past several decades, limited research has been conducted to document key procedures associated with continuous improvement and the creation of new programs. This problem is only exacerbated when considering the role of innovation during emergency situations. PURPOSE OR GOAL: The purpose of this study is to show one approach (using photovoice) to understand how student voices can be incorporated into the continuous improvement and new program development process, specifically during emergency situations. In contrast to traditional passive data collection methods, such as a survey or focus groups, photovoice is an active data collection method where students engage in the information sharing and interpretation process at a deeper level. Using photovoice, researchers and practitioners, alike, can gain greater insights into the who, what, and how of educational effectiveness. The guiding research question is as follows: What are the factors which can influence the discovery, evaluation, and exploitation of continuous improvement and new program development during emergency situations? APPROACH OR METHODOLOGY/METHODS: This approach uses participatory research, wherein students act as researchers and actively participate in the data collection and analysis process. Under the umbrella of participatory research, the study uses photovoice for collecting qualitative data. The study was implemented in a software engineering course at a university located in the United Kingdom. Students responded to the photovoice prompts by supplying both picture and narrative. The prompts target student perceptions (positive and negative) with respect to blended learning perceptions, technology integration, and career preparedness. The qualitative data was analyzed for themes using NVivo. ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES: Analysis of the qualitative data led the researchers to identify three core themes related to the blended learning approach implemented as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) Institution - macro level, (2) Instruction - mezzo level, and (3) Student - micro level. CONCLUSIONS: The study concludes with recommendations for various higher education benefactors of the user generated data including administration, faculty, marketing, recruitment, advisors, and the students, themselves. It is intended for the overall recommendations to have a direct impact on improving the student experience.",Bosman L.; Naeem U.; Padumadasa E.,Conference Proceeding,"9th Research in Engineering Education Symposium and 32nd Australasian Association for Engineering Education Conference, REES AAEE 2021: Engineering Education Research Capability Development",2021-01-01,Queen Mary University of London;Purdue University,emergency situations ;  Entrepreneurial mindset ;  program assessment
Multistakeholder analysis of a novel STEM intervention using physical activity and play,"CONTEXT Understanding the success of any teaching program often needs to look wider than just metrics. This is particularly true for STEM disciplines where the metrics of unqualified success are clear. However, for students who struggle in class it can remain something of a mystery, or worse, it becomes demotivating resulting in failure to engage. Thus by looking beyond performance metrics towards engagement and mitigating attitudinal changes, barriers to learning may be uncovered. PURPOSE OR GOAL A previously reported successful multidisciplinary STEM program using physical activity was examined to identify statistically relevant indicators for its success. This was to aid in translational opportunities to other STEM areas that are of a national priority. Success to improve student engagement in STEM subjects was the underlying objective, especially for student cohorts that have been identified by various agencies as typical non-engagers. APPROACH OR METHODOLOGY/METHODS This study using a 360 degree stakeholder analysis of technology of a short term STEM intervention to determine measures of its success and failures. It uses semi structured interviews to capture feedback from students, educators and educational system administrators. Traditional hard measures of scholastic of performance was also be used. Measures of academic records is an example of scholastic performance that were used. ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES Based on earlier work, we anticipate that changes in attitudinal experience of STEM and higher engagement with the education system will be a short term outcome. Reflective analysis from the stakeholders (educators) will likely provide longitudinal information about the efficacy of the program. If the anticipated outcomes are shown as accurate, collaborations with key stakeholders will be established to develop novel curricula based on what has been found, while still fitting the established education curriculum requirements. CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS/SUMMARY From the earlier research and what is anticipated to be found in this study, greater student engagement in STEM based learning is possible. This will lead to further collaborations in order to develop novel teaching methods built on each student's own physical and play activities.",Lee J.; Willis C.; Wheeler K.; Parker J.; White P.; James D.,Conference Proceeding,"9th Research in Engineering Education Symposium and 32nd Australasian Association for Engineering Education Conference, REES AAEE 2021: Engineering Education Research Capability Development",2021-01-01,Griffith University;The University of Queensland;Charles Darwin University;Northern Territory Department of Education,STEM education ;  student engagement ;  technology innovation
LENS: A Model for Engineering Faculty Development,"CONTEXT Engineering educators could benefit from a faculty development model that meets them where they are, in both their discipline and their journey as educators. It is often difficult to get academics to talk about their teaching as it relates to educational research, and research shows that those in engineering programs, even with a pandemic-imposed accommodation to delivery, participate in fewer educational development opportunities than their colleagues in other disciplines. This reluctance to develop as educators may help explain why student and faculty surveys of student engagement rank engineering educators lowest in the categories of effective teaching practices and providing a supportive learning environment. PURPOSE OR GOAL This work presents the LENS (Learning Environments Nurture Success) model of engineering faculty development. The six “lenses” represented in the LENS model align with the evidence-based characteristics of an effective learning environment for engineering students: (1) academic rigour, (2) focus on learning, (3) instructional support, (4) quality of teaching, (5) student-faculty relationships, and (6) student engagement. APPROACH OR METHODOLOGY/METHODS The LENS model is based on a conceptual framework that draws on five key areas: (1) student success in engineering programs, (2) change and innovation in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) teaching, (3) threshold concepts associated with post-secondary teaching, (4) an educator's journey from novice to expert teacher, and (5) the findings of myriad studies in research-based instructional strategies (RBIS), discipline-based education research (DBER) in STEM programs, and engineering education research (EER). Each of these research areas shares a social constructivist viewpoint with a vision of students who are engaged, successful, and value their learning. ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES Following a literature review, each lens is defined, identifies commonly used instructional strategies, and suggests evidence-based strategies that can be implemented to enhance one's teaching practice. The breakdown provides level-appropriate recommendations for faculty at three stages of development: first-order change for those wanting to do things better, second-order change for those choosing to do better things, and third-order or epistemic change for those primed to make a transformational shift in their teaching. CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS/SUMMARY The LENS model contributes to the body of scholarly work associated with engineering faculty development by (1) offering a practical framework that supports educational development and planning for all forms of delivery (face-to-face, remote, blended, or hybrid) that can be used independently, in consultation with an Educational Developer, or in collaboration with colleagues, (2) threading educator-related threshold concepts associated with learning, pedagogy, and assessment through each of the six lenses, and (3) linking interdisciplinary research focused on facilitating the success of engineering students.",Nelson N.; Brennan R.,Conference Proceeding,"9th Research in Engineering Education Symposium and 32nd Australasian Association for Engineering Education Conference, REES AAEE 2021: Engineering Education Research Capability Development",2021-01-01,University of Calgary,engineering education ;  Faculty development ;  instructional development
MAXIMISING STUDENT'S LEARNING THROUGH LEARNING ANALYTICS,"This paper documents an innovation that is employing the Conceive-Design-Implement-Operate (CDIO) Engineering Education Framework, with a strong emphasis on utilizing the affordances of technological tools – especially the use of Learning Analytics (LA) to diagnose student learning gaps and enhance instructional interventions. The School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering (EEE) implemented an Assessing Learning in Real Time (ALERT) strategy for a first-year module (Digital Electronics) involving 19 lecturers and 1211 students, during a COVID-19 circuit-breaker, where students were primarily in a home-based learning mode. ALERT is a joint initiative by the 5 Polytechnics and Institute of Technical Education to create a technology driven framework that incorporate the application of educational technology (EdTech) tools and data visualization software to facilitate learning. The research explored how students experienced specific interventions in real time learning (e.g., the use of readiness tests and an exit poll) through the use of learning analytics (LA) which captures, analyses, and presents student’s performance data in a visual dashboard. The findings provided valuable insights into how students experience their online learning in real time, clearly highlighting specific areas of pedagogic focus for enhancing learning effectiveness and efficiency; most notably the importance of well-crafted examples, exercises, and quiz questions to provide opportunities for sufficient practice and feedback. In summary, LA can significantly contribute to the affordances that technology offers teaching professionals in meeting the challenges of today’s rapidly changing educational landscape.",Ming M.; Kee C.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International CDIO Conference,2021-01-01,Singapore Polytechnic,"Evidence-Based Teaching ;  Learning Analytics ;  Standards: 8, 11"
EFFECT OF CRUMB RUBBER ON ASPHALT MIX,"Pavement deformation in roads is a major issue in pavement engineering. Such deformation results from rutting and fatigue induced by fluctuations in temperature, overloading from trucks and fatigueloading from traffic. As Australia experiences hot-climate conditions due to its geographical location, in conjunction with heavy vehicular loading due to the use of road trains, and cyclic loading due to an increasing number of vehicles on the road spurred by population growth, there is no doubt greater innovation is needed to combat the deformation caused by these factors. A novel way of combatting these permanent deformations is represented in the new practice of increasing road performance via modifications to stone mastic asphalt (SMA) using a polymer. This chapter discusses the incorporation and effects of crumb rubber (CR) as a modifying polymer towards improving road performance. The modification of SMA using CR improves both the high- and lowtemperature properties of SMA, significantly improving its elastic recovery. This, therefore, improves the fatigue and rutting capabilities of the asphalt, in turn extending its service life. Currently in Australia, only 8% of tyres are locally recycled; therefore, to curve the environmental effects associated with this innovation, CR modification requires further development. Despite this technology demonstrating superior performance characteristics and greater economic and ecological feasibility, it has not yet materialised. This study makes an important contribution to current understandings in pavement engineering by expanding knowledge on the abovementioned technology and identifying current research gaps pertaining to the influence of CRmodified SMA in rutting and fatigue performance. Further, the study focuses on the effects of this SMA modification under conditions of varying CR particle size. Specifically, the effects of CR sizing on the mechanical properties in both rutting and fatigue were investigated. The study additionally compared the performance of the modified samples with standard non-modified SMA. The laboratory experiment incorporates wheel-tracking and four-point beam-bending testing. The different CR sizes that were subjected to testing in the current study were Mesh #30, Mesh #16 and Mesh #8, where rutting resistance, fatigue life and flexural stiffness figures were obtained to determine the optimal CR particle size.",Madzoski J.; Chegenizadeh A.; Nikraz H.,Book,Pavement Engineering and Waste Materials,2021-01-01,Curtin University,
Planetary Gearbox Prototype Development and Manufacturing,"Goal of this research was to develop and manufacture planetary gearbox prototype using rapid prototyping technology (additive manufacturing). Developed prototype was used to visually analyse the design of the planetary gearbox. Also, it was used to improve and innovate education of students on several courses at Mechanical Design study program at Faculty of Mechanical Engineering. It is shown that low cost rapid prototyping technology can be used to manufacture prototypes of complex machines and machine elements. Prototypes manufactured using this technology have same functionality like the real one. Main limitation is the fact that they cannot sustain real world loads and stresses. This paper shows opportunities which low cost rapid prototyping technology is offering in improvement and innovation of education process at engineering schools and faculties. All complex and heavy machines can be manufactured using this type of technology and on that way more precisely presented to the students.",Smajic J.; Saric I.; Muminovic A.; Delic M.; Muminovic A.,Journal,Tehnicki Glasnik,2021-01-01,Univerzitet u Sarajevu,education ;  mechanical design ;  planetary gearbox ;  rapid prototyping
DEFINING INTENDED LEARNING OUTCOMES (ILO'S) OF INTER-PROGRAM CBL TOWARDS ACHIEVING CONSTRUCTIVE ALIGNMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF ISBEP,"We present a framework that connects identified competence areas with Indented Learning Outcomes (ILO's). Such a framework is likely to be useful for the design of inter-program Challenge-Based Learning (CBL) in engineering education. The framework was developed out of a need to increase the constructive alignment (CA) of ILO's, learning/teaching activities, and assessment of the Innovation Space Bachelor End Project (ISBEP); an inter-program CBL initiative at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). The framework was developed based on a co-creation session, and set up around the definition of ILO's as departing point to reach CA. We contribute a comprehensive framework listing the ILO's associated with inter-program CBL at the third-year, bachelor level, and identify three categories related to design and research processes, professional skills, and professional identity and self-directed learning. Furthermore, we illustrate our findings with practices from ISBEP, highlighting the influence of ILO's on our efforts to reach alignment. Finally, we discuss the implications for CBL design, propose future work, and draw attention to possible limitations in the use of the framework.",Valencia A.; Bruns M.; Reymen I.; Ruijten P.; Pepin B.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the SEFI 49th Annual Conference: Blended Learning in Engineering Education: Challenging, Enlightening - and Lasting?",2021-01-01,Technische Universiteit Eindhoven,Challenge Based Learning ;  Constructive Alignment ;  Inter-Program Education ;  Interdisciplinary Education
Analysis Of Process Models For The Business Model Development Considering Special SME Requirements For Offering PSS,"The continuous testing and redesign of current business models and the associated adaptation of increasingly customized value propositions are nowadays becoming more and more important for companies. Thereby the additional or integrated offering of services as new forms of hybrid value creation are gaining importance. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular are still at the beginning of the challenge of successfully designing the transformation to offer product service systems (PSS), as they often lack time, technical and methodological resources. This paper first describes the derived requirements for a process model of PSS-oriented business model development for SMEs. The requirements result on the one hand from the research of current scientific publications on this topic and on the other hand from the analysis and evaluation of use cases from practice at SMEs. This is followed by an overview of current process models that deal with business model development and innovation. The identified process models are analyzed in terms of the considered phases, the used methods, and the industries of the potential users. Furthermore, they are examined for SME suitability on the basis of the derived requirements. By means of the comparison of the current process models and the requirements from the SMEs the necessity of an adaption and further detailing of the individual phases of the process models is pointed out. SMEs have to be able to apply these models independently. Finally, the article presents an initial approach specifying the development phase of PSS-oriented business models by means of detailed planning with a focus on the mechanical and plant engineering sector to support the users.",Lins D.; Arnold D.; Köhler C.; Mahl T.; Prinz C.; Kuhlenkötter B.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the Conference on Production Systems and Logistics,2021-01-01,Hochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft Saarbrücken;Ruhr-Universitat Bochum,business model development ;  hybrid value creation ;  process planning ;  product service systems ;  SME
INTRODUCTION TO INDUSTRIAL DESIGN AND PRODUCT CASE STUDIES,"This paper describes the practical elements included in the first term of a second-year engineering module which was developed in alignment with CDIO standards. The students were assigned into teams based on their course of study (i.e. electronics, biomedical, and sports engineering). Each team would be free to choose, research, and evaluate three products with some relevance to their field. Aspects such as technology, regulations and user reviews would have to be considered within the analysis. The scientific principles involved in the products would have to be explained in reasonable depth and aspects such as product end-of-life management (sustainability) also mentioned. Multiple sources would have to be used such as scientific articles, product specifications, regulations, and online reviews. The students would have to use available resources without necessarily having the actual physical product at hand. Once the teams had gained insight on the products they would have to either choose one of the products to improve, or decide to design a new product, (relevant to their discipline). The teams would have to produce a report and a demonstrator of their designs by the end of term. The demonstrator would have to be a physical representation with some functionality that can effectively communicate the proposed concept. The students were expected to use the tools and experience gained during previous and prerequisite modules, for designing and prototyping. The report was also expected to contain references to the indicative reading. The module would be an opportunity to build upon previous knowledge obtained through both, core and specialized modules. Additionally, a research element was included both in terms of the students looking into the cutting-edge technologies of their subject but also in trying to push those boundaries. This study aims at describing the module rationale, and reflecting upon inclusivity, and pedagogical effectiveness.",Siegkas P.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International CDIO Conference,2021-01-01,Nottingham Trent University,"Group projects ;  industrial design ;  innovation ;  Standards: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8"
Medical Textiles,"This textbook aims to ensure that advances in medical textiles are addressed and that recent developments are able to be appreciated and understood not only by medical practitioners and healthcare personnel but also by textile scientists and technologists. The idea is to stimulate collaborative research and development in the field of medical textiles and to equip researchers with an understanding of the steps they need to take to ensure that their efforts, be they to develop new devices for implantation or items for external application, are carried out in such a way as to improve their effectiveness and enhance the prospects for their implementation. Attention is drawn to the need to improve outcomes in the practical setting and to guidance on the detailed planning required prior to engaging in experimental work. Standard tests can help researchers to monitor performance, but for some important applications such as those required to demonstrate antimicrobial and fluid-repellent performance in most items of protective wear, standard tests consistently fall seriously short in terms of predicting how well they might work in the practical setting. Guidance is therefore given for their further development. Chapters within the textbook cover: The history of innovation within medical textiles with particular attention given to key concepts of the latter part of the 19th Century and subsequent associated developments. Textile and polymer science underpinning fibres, fabrics, nano-fibre technology and the functional finishes that can be applied to enhance the performance of medical textile products. Woven, knitted, nonwoven and braided fabrics and the key performance characteristics of each fabric type which make them particularly suited to specific medical textile roles such as mesh, grafts, filtration and scaffolds for tissue engineering. Implantable medical textiles, non-implantable medical textiles, health and hygiene products and extracorporeal devices that use textile products. Legislative requirements for medical devices. The design of experiments and suitability for purpose of textile test methods. Case studies to illustrate how medical textiles are applied in practice. The book provides essential reading for textile professionals, biomedical engineers, and others involved in the research, design and engineering of medical and healthcare appliances, and for those employed in the medical profession wishing to gain new insights into the wealth of materials at their disposal.",Morris H.; Murray R.,Book,Medical Textiles,2021-01-01,The Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh;Feng Chia University,

Food engineering innovations across the food supply chain: debrief and learnings from the ICEF13 congress and the future of food engineering,"This chapter reflects on the current state and provides future directions of the growing field of food engineering across the food chain, from on-farm postharvest and sustainable processing to nutrient delivery in the body for sustained or improved health. Key learnings from the International Congress on Engineering and Food, ICEF13, held in Melbourne, Australia, in September 2019, are highlighted. Some of the food systems and innovation trends conveyed in keynote talks, oral presentations, and e-posters summarized here are detailed in the chapters of this book and in special issues of two reference food engineering journals. A global overview of biosystems engineering solutions for developed and developing countries includes alternative protein sources, postharvest engineering for food waste transformation and sustainability. Then, advances in food processing technologies including refrigeration, freezing, thermal and nonthermal processing, and drying are discussed. An update on the innovative use of technologies such as extrusion for alternative ingredient production and innovative texturization, 3D food printing for personalized structuring and nutrition, pulsed electric field or hydrostatic pressure for structuring, as well as precision fermentation and other methods for bioactive incorporation is provided. The chapter also covers advances in ecofriendly antimicrobial and intelligent packaging with in-built micro- and nanosensors. Other sensor technologies integrated into digital manufacturing using Industry 4.0 are presented in the context of the food supply chain. Engineers are increasingly involved in consumer health research by creating more representative in vitro mimetics of human oral processing and digestion devices that are coupled with nutrient delivery models. The chapter concludes with suggestions to modify the food engineering curricula to (a) prepare food engineers of the future for global challenges appearing in both developing and developed countries, and (b) develop broader technical, interpersonal, and integrated regional and global supply chain skills. Food engineering will continue to play an important role in the development of cutting-edge smart processes that transform and personalize foods targeting individual nourishment and improved body function via controlled delivery strategies.

"Concrete Oceans: The Dolos, Apartheid Engineering, and the Intertidal Zone","This article is concerned with an object called the “dolos,” a concrete coastal structure developed by the South African state at the height of apartheid, in 1963. A twisted H-shape with attenuating limbs, it is formally rather beautiful, exhibiting a kind of brutal elegance, and it has been successfully used in hydraulic engineering projects around the globe. It is, nevertheless, a relatively unremarkable invention. Even in its category of “coastal armor,” it was invented 14 years after the first, French-patented Tetrapod. And yet, during apartheid and after, it captured the popular imagination of many white citizens who proudly connected with the narrative of innovation, self-sufficiency and apartheid modernity. The history of the dolos reveals a modernizing state that worked vigorously through its parastatals and research institutions to explore the material, structural and esthetic possibilities of concrete to articulate a convincing and legitimate national identity. This article joins with scholars in the critical oceanic humanities who are arguing for more-than-human, Anthropocene-directed research in the Global South, framed by Kimberley Peters and Philip Steinberg’s call to adopt a more-than-wet ontology addressing the (i) materiality, (ii) motion, and (iii) temporality of the ocean and, indeed, of ocean infrastructure.",Cane J.,Journal,Geohumanities,2021-01-01,University of Pretoria,apartheid ;  concrete ;  infrastructure ;  oceanic humanities

FORMATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF CLUSTERS AS PROVIDING AN INNOVATION AND INVESTMENT MODEL OF ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT: FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC EXPERIENCE,"In the conditions of formation and development of Ukraine as an independent state, the priority is the need to implement economic policy, one of the components of which is cluster policy. It is to support the creation and operation of clusters. In particular, such issues as factors of formation, development and causes of cluster decline. Understanding these reasons, classifying and assessing significance will help enhance public cluster policy measures, which was the aim of this research. The information base of the study consisted of statistical materials, regulations, national cluster development programs in such countries as: Austria, Belarus, Bulgaria, Great Britain, Estonia, Canada, China, Germany, Norway and others. Implementation of regulations will contribute to the creation and development of clusters. A significant achievement is the use of the method of comparison in the analysis of the peculiarities of the functioning of clusters, current regulations on the creation and development of clusters in different countries and in Ukraine. Due to the use of a systematic and structural approach, the factors that hinder the development of clusters in Ukraine have been identified. The study found that in foreign countries there are several main determinants of cluster formation: concentration in the region of competitive enterprises; availability of competitive advantages for development; geographical concentration and proximity to settlements; wide choice of participants and the presence of “critical mass”. In contrast to the rest of the world, Ukraine has factors that hinder the development of clusters (limited functioning of transport and engineering infrastructure; low level of organizational development of the cluster, including lack of experience in strategic planning of cluster development, lack of effective information communication between cluster members; limited access to foreign markets, etc.). In this regard, it is necessary to: develop a regulatory framework for the creation and operation of clusters (define at the legislative level the concepts of “cluster”, “cluster policy”, “clustering”; create and implement government programs to promote cluster development; create a Register of clusters in Ukraine); develop cluster connections and networking; to attract credit funds from international financial organizations on program principles; increase the influence and responsibility of local authorities in the context of decentralization in relation to ensuring the development of clusters; to develop models of using the mechanism of public-private partnership in order to attract non-state investment resources for the development of clusters, etc. The most effective way to provide conditions for the growth of the role of clusters may be the creation of cross-border clusters, as evidenced by international experience. A promising area is cooperation between Chambers of Commerce and clusters.",Boiko O.; Vasiutkina N.; Kondratiuk O.; Stoianenko I.,Journal,Journal of Hygienic Engineering and Design,2021-01-01,Institute for Economics and Forecasting of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine;European University;State University of Trade and Economics,Cluster ;  Cluster initiatives ;  Cluster policy ;  Cross-border cluster ;  Cross-border cooperation ;  Innovation and investment model of enterprise development
"A reliability, durability and safety study of Alkaline and Polymer Electrolyte Membrane electrolyzers","GRTgaz is the French owner and operator of the longest high-pressure natural gas transmission network in Europe. GRTgaz has its own research center, the Research and Innovation Center for Energy, RICE. For several years, RICE has been working to transform gas infrastructures and to accelerate the integration of renewable gases and hydrogen in the gas networks. The current energy infrastructure must evolve towards new competitive large-scale storage solutions. One solution studied by GRTgaz is chemical storage in hydrogen. In this context, project Jupiter 1000 was launched, with the contribution of engineering, technical and research teams from GRTgaz and its partners. The main goal is to conduct an industrial scale experiment on a Power-to-Gas pilot installation with injection into the natural gas transmission network. Jupiter 1000 is the first industrial demonstrator of Power-to-Gas in France with a power rating of 1 MWe for electrolysis and a methanation process with carbon capture. Green hydrogen is produced from 100% renewable energy, using two different technologies of electrolyzers: an alkaline electrolyzer and a Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) electrolyzer. This will allow RICE’s research team to compare the two technologies on an economical, performance, and safety points of view. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the current development status of the reliability study conducted on both types of electrolyzer of Jupiter 1000. The project will be conducted in two phases:-The first one will focus on understanding the reliability of both technologies, meaning their ability to perform as required, without failure, for a given time interval. This part breaks down the mechanisms of both technologies to simple elementary functions and/or components that will then allow to conduct a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA). The FMEA evaluates the severity and probability of occurrence of failures that may occur on these electrolyzers, to prioritize the most critical ones. It also documents current knowledge and actions about the risks of failures, and how to use them to improve the system.-The second phase will focus on the durability, which is their ability to perform as required, under given conditions of use and maintenance, until the end of service life. It will attend to finding the degradation phenomena that affect the durability and safety of alkaline or PEM type electrolyzers.-The last one will focus on safety-related issues on hydrogen production in electrolyzers, in order to point out recommendations on vessel design and operating mode that will allow to meet its particular safety demands. Based on this, it will be possible to identify the critical elements in terms of reliability, safety and durability and examined them thoroughly in order to advance the understanding of phenomena that can reduce the service life or degrade the safety of alkaline and PEM type electrolyzers, and thereby provide recommendations in terms of safety-related functions, monitoring functions, maintenance policy and operational conditions for each technology of electrolyzer.",Soual S.; Brissaud F.; Lazrek R.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 31st European Safety and Reliability Conference, ESREL 2021",2021-01-01,GRTgaz,Alkaline electrolyzer ;  Durability ;  Gas network ;  Gas pipeline ;  Maintenance ;  Operational risks ;  Pem electrolyzer ;  Power-to-Gas ;  Reliability ;  Risk analysis ;  Risk assessment ;  Risk management ;  Safety
Human-Automation Interaction for a Small Autonomous Urban Ferry: A Concept Sketch,"At the NTNU in Trondheim, a new Centre for Research and Innovation started in 2021 with the aim of supporting the Norwegian industry’s attempts to realize autonomous shipping. One of its use cases is AutoFerry, a small autonomous urban passenger ferry crossing the harbour canal in Trondheim. This research area is usually technology cantered and there is a lack of Human Factors (HF) research. This concept paper is presenting some design sketches of Human-Automation Interaction for this ferry. The ferry’s operating concept is simple but includes some difficult problems regarding HF and interaction design implementations. First, the design of interaction between the autonomous ferry and other, manned vessels in the canal: How to signal intentions using different interfaces? Second, the design of the control room: Situation Awareness by different sensors, automation transparency, and how do the operator understand and interact with automation? And thirdly, the interaction between the crew-less ferry and passengers: How to promote trust and safety, and how to handle emergencies?

A prototype pavilion in textile reinforced concrete: A tool for research and pedagogy,"This paper presents a work performed in the last years on a Textile Reinforced Concrete (TRC) Prototype Pavilion, raising questions about research on architecture and engineering within a pedagogical context. The construction of the pavilion explores how a hands-on approach builds up multi-layered knowledge and constitutes a common ground of communication on which architects and engineers meet. Through the act of construction, architects and engineers work together, generating new knowledge and experiencing how tacit knowledge is built-up and transmitted. It also allows for the processes of conception and manufacture to feed and to enrichen each other. This action of making knowledge (τέχνη, techne) constructs a thought or a concept as a tangible physical entity, acting as a communication interface between the work and the mind, spanning over different disciplines. The paper highlights the fact that the act of building is not only an intellectual and technical task. Within an education context, students experience the complete process of observation, analysis, conception, execution and testing. The direct investigation of materiality is thus essentially an invention and innovation process: An iterative cycle building up knowledge through observation on the making. Through their corporal experience, students identify and engage with the research work, leading to collective action and to individual responsibility. Such engagement opens up perspectives on architectural, engineering as well as social, economic and environmental questions for the 21st century: Sustainable and resilient construction, economy of means, adequacy of expression.",Guaita P.; Baur R.; Ruiz M.; Fernández-Ordóñez D.,Conference Proceeding,fib Symposium,2021-01-01,CEU Universities;Universidad Politécnica de Madrid;École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne;International Federation for Structural Concrete,
Designing for innovation: From model-use to thinkingin models,"As typical problem solvers, structural engineers often face new and complex problems, recently for instance due to digitalization or climate change. Often, such problems cannot be approached using established methods. Instead, structural engineers need to rethink existing problem-solving processes and develop new approaches. In this paper, we propose that an inductive approach of thinking in models is essential to address complex new problems in structural engineering and generate innovations. Based on a literature review, we explore the meaning and importance of this approach and illustrates it with two examples of practice. Hereby, we aim to provide an account of the potentials of this approach in structural engineering to design for innovations and seek to contribute to a change of mind-set in engineering practice as well as in research and education.",Ruge J.; Bögle A.,Conference Proceeding,fib Symposium,2021-01-01,HafenCity University Hamburg,
Research on Product Kansei Intention Model based on BP Neural Network,"Facing the design and development of complex products, the traditional design innovation model can not solve the problem of the transformation of consumers' emotional information in the design process. The main reason is that users' emotional information is difficult to capture in the design process, and the traditional design process can not solve complex problems. In this case, it is necessary to establish a product perceptual intention model based on perceptual engineering and neural network. The model is not only a new method of product innovation design, but also a market-oriented process to reduce design risk. This research is an interdisciplinary application research. Taking the electric water heater product as an example, the model is constructed, mainly using the relevant theoretical knowledge of perceptual engineering and neural network. The model transforms emotional information into measurable data, and establishes the corresponding relationship between product shape structure and perceptual evaluation value through BP neural network. The model provides a reliable scientific theoretical basis for the perceptual design of products, can speed up the product development process, reduce the development cost, and make the development results more in line with consumers' expectations. The model is suitable for enterprise application and is an effective supplement to the traditional design method. Similarly, the model can also provide reference for the development and design of other products.",Li Y.; Feng Q.; Wang S.; Han X.; Yang L.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2021 3rd International Symposium on Smart and Healthy Cities, ISHC 2021",2021-01-01,Shandong Jianzhu University;Ltd.,BP Neural Network ;  electric water heater ;  Kansei intention ;  model ;  product design

"Unlocking the Future with Flexible, Wire-Shaped Supercapacitors","Supercapacitors are critical to the mainstream adoption of a variety of technologies enabling applications such as Cleantech, Wearables, and Internet of Things (IoT). While the value added by supercapacitors is known and well documented, finding the physical space to incorporate supercapacitors in those systems is a challenge to overcome. Traditional supercapacitors are physically rigid energy storage components that are available in a cylindrical or rectangular shape that are installed on printed circuit boards (PCBs), where space is highly valuable. This traditional form factor limits an engineer’s placement options making it difficult to utilize supercapacitors in certain applications. This physical restriction forces engineers to make difficult design and performance tradeoffs. Capacitech Energy, Inc. is commercializing research from the University of Central Florida that reimagined the form factor of supercapacitors to be physically flexible and wire-shaped. This innovation leverages its novel form factor to eliminate the need to make painful engineering tradeoffs. Flexible supercapacitors can be routed through areas where space is available on the PCB or alternatively, placed off the PCB and integrated into other parts of the product or system’s infrastructure. This placement advantage and the supercapacitor’s high-power density make this technology well suited to complement modern energy harvesting technologies and batteries used in a variety of applications. Many opportunities exist to complement power sources with this cable-based supercapacitor’s peak-power capability and to build cable-based backup power systems. This innovation helps designers meet their goals by building discrete and distributed networks of supercapacitors, made possible by this innovative form factor helping engineer build next generation smart city electronics, wearables, solar power systems, electric vehicles and more.",Sleppy J.; Silverstein A.; Moser D.,Journal,"Journal of Fluid Flow, Heat and Mass Transfer",2021-01-01,Inc,Energy storage systems ;  flexible electronics ;  internet-of-things ;  supercapacitors ;  wearables
Whole heart engineering: Advances and challenges,"Bioengineering a solid organ for organ replacement is a growing endeavor in regenerative medicine. Our approach - recellularization of a decellularized cadaveric organ scaffold with human cells - is currently the most promising approach to building a complex solid vascularized organ to be utilized in vivo, which remains the major unmet need and a key challenge. The 2008 publication of perfusion-based decellularization and partial recellularization of a rat heart revolutionized the tissue engineering field by showing that it was feasible to rebuild an organ using a decellularized extracellular matrix scaffold. Toward the goal of clinical translation of bioengineered tissues and organs, there is increasing recognition of the underlying need to better integrate basic science domains and industry. From the perspective of a research group focusing on whole heart engineering, we discuss the current approaches and advances in whole organ engineering research as they relate to this multidisciplinary field’s 3 major pillars: organ scaffolds, large numbers of cells, and biomimetic bioreactor systems. The success of whole organ engineering will require optimization of protocols to produce biologically-active scaffolds for multiple organ systems, and further technological innovation both to produce the massive quantities of high-quality cells needed for recellularization and to engineer a bioreactor with physiologic stimuli to recapitulate organ function. Also discussed are the challenges to building an implantable vascularized solid organ.",Morrissey J.; Mesquita F.; Hochman-Mendez C.; Taylor D.,Journal,Cells Tissues Organs,2021-01-01,Texas Heart Institute;RegenMedix Consulting,Bioartificial organ ;  Decellularization ;  Extracellular matrix ;  Organ engineering ;  Scaffold

Metallic Biomaterials in Tissue Engineering: Retrospect and Prospects,"Metallic biomaterials and their use in tissue engineering (TE) have always been the focus of study ever since research in tissue regeneration initiated. With the day-to-day emergence of tissue engineering and its applications in health care and research, development of novel biomaterials became imperative. The importance of metallic biomaterials in tissue engineering is ascribed to their exceptional amalgamation of properties like high mechanical strength, shape memory, controlled degradation, anti-microbial activity, radiopacity and their blending for preparation of different alloys and amalgams. With the advent of modern processing technologies like additive manufacturing, metallic biomaterials with controlled porosity and degradation rates have been fabricated. These fabricated biomaterials exhibited enhanced cytocompatibility and anti-corrosion activity which have been the major drawbacks for their usage in the past. New innovations in fabricating metallic biomaterials paved the way for regeneration of tissues with desired shape and size for their potential use in bone, cartilage, dental and cardiovascular tissue engineering. Our present chapter deals in detail the advent of metallic biomaterials in TE, their evolution, importance and drawbacks, properties, types and applications of metallic biomaterials in TE, along with future prospects.",Chowdhury S.; Nagarjuna V.; Bhaskar B.,Book,Biomaterials in Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine: From Basic Concepts to State of the Art Approaches,2021-01-01,L.V.

Identification of Cyber Security Risks in Subscription-based Business Models for Manufacturing Companies and Derivation of Suitable Measures,"In the age of digitalization, manufacturing companies are under increased pressure to change due to product complexity, growing customer requirements and digital business models. The increasing digitization of processes and products is opening up numerous opportunities for mechanical engineering companies to exploit the resulting potential for value creation. Subscription business is a new form of business model in the mechanical engineering industry, which aims to continuously increase customer benefit to align the interests of both companies and customers. Characterized by a permanent data exchange, databased learning about customer behavior, and the transfer into continuous innovations to increase customer value, subscription business helps to make Industry 4.0 profitable. The fact that machines and plants are connected to the internet and exchange large amounts of data results in critical information security risks. In addition, the loss of knowledge and control, data misuse and espionage, as well as the manipulation of transaction or production data in the context of subscription transactions are particularly high risks. Complementary to direct and obvious consequences such as loss of production, the attacks are increasingly shifting to non-transparent and creeping impairments of production or product quality, which are only apparent at a late stage, or the influencing of payment flows. A transparent presentation of possible risks and their scope, as well as their interrelationships, does not exist. This paper shows a research approach in which the structure of subscription models and their different manifestations based on their risks and vulnerabilities are characterized. This allows suitable cyber security measures to be taken at an early stage. From this basis, companies can secure existing or planned subscription business models and thus strengthen the trust of business partners and customers.",Schuh G.; Stich V.; Hicking J.; Kaminski L.; Engländer J.; Majchrzak A.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the Conference on Production Systems and Logistics,2021-01-01,Aachen University,Cyber Security ;  Digital Transformation ;  Manufacturing Companies ;  Subscription Business
Design Methodologies for Sustainable Mobility Systems,"The balance between the environment, traffic and freedom of mobility is one of the great challenges of our time. During the last decades, vehicles have become significantly more efficient, however, motorized transport still causes severe negative environmental impacts through the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG), air pollutants and noise, as well as land use and resource consumption. Sustainable mobility has been subject to a large number of research projects on the individual technologies and innovations have been carried out and published. However, most studies only consider individual modes of transport and not the entire transport system. Furthermore, the aspect of sustainability is often limited to environmental issues or GHG emissions. We discuss sustainability in a more holistic approach which integrates environmental, economic and social sustainability and we provide design methodologies and exemplary applications to support the transformation towards sustainable mobility in the future. This should be of interest to both, engineering design researchers and practitioners from the automotive industry as well as fleet operators. The applicability of our methodologies is shown with examples which are taken from current research at TU Berlin as well as solutions which have already been validated in operational application.",Göhlich D.; Syré A.; Van der Schoor M.; Jefferies D.; Grahle A.; Heide L.,Book,"Design Methodology for Future Products: Data Driven, Agile and Flexible",2021-01-01,Technische Universität Berlin,
"How do Lawyers Engineer and Develop LegalTech Projects? A Story of Opportunities, Platforms, Creative Rationalities, and Strategies","Over the last 15 years, the working context of lawyers has undergone many changes. Evolving in an increasingly competitive, deregulated, and globalized market, they are subject to higher tax pressure while being exposed to unbridled technological innovation. Indeed, a growing number of entrepreneurs are using digital solutions to provide online legal services that are supposed to be faster and cheaper. If many of them are nonlawyer legal entrepreneurs, many lawyers are also engineering innovative projects and launching their own start-up companies, known as “LegalTech” or “LawTech.” However, few studies—or none to our limited knowledge—provide an empirically grounded analysis of such projects, leaving some questions unanswered. Who are these entrepreneurial lawyers? How and why do they engineer and develop LegalTech projects? How do they challenge the legal profession? To answer these questions, this article draws on a qualitative study of three contrasted start-ups Belgian lawyers have recently developed. The research methodology combines gray and scientific literature reviews, web-document (hereafter “manifestos”) analysis, and semi-directive interviews led with the start-up’s founders (n = 5), the Bar Association’s representatives (n = 3), and some members of the main Belgian LegalTech network (n = 4).",Dubois C.,Journal,"Law, Technology and Humans",2021-01-01,Université de Liège,lawyers ;  LegalTech ;  organization ;  profession ;  projects ;  strategies

Development of production planning system for shipbuilding using component-based development framework,"Production planning is a key part of production management of manufacturing enterprises. Since computerization began, modern production planning has been developed starting with Material Requirement Planning (MRP), and today Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS), Supply Chain Management (SCM) has been spreading and advanced. However, in the shipbuilding field, rather than applying these general-purpose production planning methodologies, in most cases, each shipyard has developed its own production planning system. This is because the applications of general-purpose production planning methods are limited due to the order-taking industry such as shipbuilding with highly complicated construction process consisting of millions of parts per ship. This study introduces the design and development of the production planning system reflecting the production environment of heavy shipyards in Korea. Since Korean shipyards such as Hyundai, Daewoo and Samsung build more than 10 ships per year (50–70 ships in the case of large shipyards), a planning system for the mixed production with complex construction processes is required. This study draws requirements using PI/BPR (process innovation and business process reengineering) methodology to develop a production planning system for shipyards that simultaneously build several ships. Then, CBD software development methodology was applied for the design and implementation of planning system with drawn requirements. It is expected that the systematic development procedure as well as the requirements and functional elements for the development of the shipyard production planning system introduced in this study will be able to present important guidelines in the related research field of shipbuilding management.",Cho S.; Lee J.; Woo J.,Journal,International Journal of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering,2021-01-01,Research Institute of Marine Systems Engineering;Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering;Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co.

Quality Evaluation of Dissertation Based on DBSCAN Clustering,"The quality of dissertations is an important reference for evaluating the quality of graduate degree-awarding. Most of the methods evaluate the quality of the dissertation from four types of dimentions, topic and review, innovation and paper value, scientific research ability and basic knowledge, and the standard expression of the paper. However, the experts' comments often have great value for evaluating the quality of the dissertations. Thus, this paper proposes an innovative method of quality evaluation of the dissertations, which integrates the experts' comments and four types of evaluation criteria mentioned above. The results show that the deviation of the dissertations' score becomes larger. So, it is easier to distinguish between excellent papers and problematic papers, as the score of low-level papers decrease, while the score of high-level papers increase. And, our proposed method has a strong generalization ability for all levels of the paper. Finally, the paper compares the indicators and comments of the eliminated papers and excellent papers in the engineering discipline, analyzes the typical characteristics of the two kinds, and gives corresponding suggestions on how to write high-level dissertations.",Wang Z.; Wang H.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 11th International Conference on Information Technology in Medicine and Education, ITME 2021",2021-01-01,Shandong Normal University,DBSCAN ;  dissertation ;  text analysis ;  thesis quality ;  Word cloud

Cross-border Previous Learning Recognition: Enhancing Lifelong Learning and Social Inclusion,"Regarded as a social advancement tool, Previous Learning Recognition (RPL) processes' development in cross-border regions should enable the transferring of qualified and Higher Education graduated workforce across territories. Within the project LLL-Transversalis, French universities have been establishing RPL assessement events with international participants (Spanish and Andorran) in order to build a cross-border RPL system in the Pyrenees region. This paper exposes the characteristiques of these unique RPL processes and the results obtained. So far, eleven events have been developed, accrediting students in the domains of Engineering, Tourism and Management. Jurys were compounded on average of 7 members from both academic and professional worlds and observers from Spain and Andorra were present. Feedback from international participants is highly positive. Due to the economic and social crisis caused by Covid-19, cross-border and national RPL could turn out to be an effective way to galvanize human capital growth in the following years, hence the value of this project's actions. Taking advantage of mobility restrictions caused by the sanitary crisis, the first online cross-border RPL events will take place later this year, setting a starting point for further research and innovation on these practices in Spain and Andorra with the help of French institutions.",Rius H.; Boumeggoti D.; Areny J.; Bernadó B.,Conference Proceeding,International Conference on Higher Education Advances,2021-01-01,University of Andorra;Université Toulouse - Jean Jaurès,assessment ;  cross-border ;  learning ;  Lifelong learning ;  previous ;  recognition

Undergraduate's Perspective on Being an Effective Online Student During Lockdown due to COVID-19 Pandemic: An Educational Data Mining Study,"The mandatory implementation of online education due to the COVID-19 outbreak has drawn research about this modality - analyzing students' perspectives about course designs, the instructors' performance, and the institution's services. In contrast, little is known about what an undergraduate should do to perform well academically, a factor that can even impact the retention of students who face this modality for the first time, according to self-determination theory and student-centered learning. This work was guided by the question: What are the effective strategies for excellent school performance in online education according to the undergraduates themselves? We performed qualitative data analysis of thirty-four letters written by second-year engineering students, with one semester of experience in online education at a private university in Mexico using an educational data mining methodology. The qualitative analysis used text and sentiment analysis tools. The texts contained academic and wellness recommendations for other learners who would start their education in this modality. The research showed that, in addition to the actions generally valid for academic success in face-to-face courses, participants advised the relevance of taking notes, leveraging digital tools, and defining a specific study space at home when learning in the online modality. In terms of wellness, participants recommended looking at the positive side of things, having a good diet, sleeping well, and resting from the computer. Higher education is a complex system in which different stakeholders participate; however, beyond excellent content, professors, technologies, and learning platforms, students consolidate learning through their actions.",Mondragon-Estrada E.; Camacho-Zuniga C.,Conference Proceeding,Future of Educational Innovation Workshop Series - Machine Learning-Driven Digital Technologies for Educational Innovation Workshop 2021,2021-01-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,educational innovation ;  higher education ;  online education ;  student perspective ;  student strategies ;  wellness

"The Design and Development of an Innovative and Environment Friendly Pilot Unit for the Transformation of Used Cooking Oils into Biodiesel in the City of Ifrane, Morocco","The improper disposal of used cooking oils (UCO) in the environment represents significant health and environmental hazard. This paper presents a viable solution to the improper management of UCOs in the city of Ifrane, Morocco (14000 inhabitants). The solution consists of the collection of the city's UCOs and their transformation into useful biodiesel. The project has been developed over the past four years and included multiple levels of intervention: research, engineering, social engagement, logistics and economics. In this paper, we focus solely on the technical and engineering design aspects of the project. An average of 300 liters of UCOs was collected each week from the various collection points in the city. A pilot unit with a production capacity of 250 liters of biodiesel per batch was developed: schematics, automation, and process flow are discussed. The pilot unit presented several opportunities for innovation beyond what is found in most literature on the subject. Solar energy and biomass are used to fulfill the heat requirement of the chemical reactions. The recycling of methanol and glycerol are performed. The entire transformation process is automated using open-source Arduino microcontrollers and switch relays. The biodiesel yield is estimated to be between 85% and 93% of the transformed UCO in about two hours of reaction.

Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) applied to Ground Segment Development of Space Missions: New Challenges.,"Solutions with optimized financial resources, design with reliability and reduced development time drives the new challenges of space missions. Consequently, ground segment has to be aligned with the requirements defined by space segment to improvement the synergy between these segments. Traditionally, a ground segment is a ready-to-run system; notwithstanding, during the mission development, new requirements can be requested. In this scenario, many questions are raised in order to meet cost and operability requirements and contribute to systemic solutions, such as document-centric designs, adoption of integration and testing procedures aimed at the ground segment, cultural inertia, information sharing policies and new project methods. Ground segment design has to demonstrate the concepts innovations that are required for the increase in data types and volume, and their processes, communications protocols, as well as modern development methods. These concepts are found in the recommendations of the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS), for: a) the standardization of the managerial interfaces of the Tracking, Telemetry, and Command (TT&C) services, b) the Space Link Extension (SLE) Protocol services for the cross support and interoperability. In addition, these concepts collaborate with the goals of the Interagency Operations Advisory Group (IOAG), for achieving full interoperability among member space agencies. The guidelines of the European Cooperation for Space Standardization (ECSS) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) on systems engineering area also cover such concepts for system development, not limited to these major entities. In this paper, we provide an overview from space segment requirements to the ground segment requirements on the point of view of Model-Based System Engineering method and the SysML modeling language to formally describe and specify a space system, notably for the Satellite Control Center and the Telemetry, Tracking and Command (TT&C) ground stations at the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). The aims of this work is to establish a process for optimization, management and implementation of the ground segment designs in a model-based approach, also considering an ontology. In such a way, we intend to improve and standardize the systems engineering practices and concurrent engineering procedures.

"SPACE EDUCATION, SPACE RESEARCH AND SPACE INDUSTRY: CONNECTING A FRAGMENTED CHAIN","The advances of knowledge gained in the last few decades have led to many technologies to benefit our everyday lives. A good part of such development builds on space exploration advances, which are essential to advancing technology, innovation, science and promoting international collaboration among nations. Nowadays, great attention is to the opportunities that space can offer us to sustain the demands of the current and future generations. Here, it is crucial to understand how people, especially young professionals, prepare to advance space exploration in a context of continuous improvement. Whilst universities encourage students to pursue STEM careers (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math), which provide basic skills needed to enter the space industry, they struggle to educate students in the wide variety of options and the specific requirements that are needed to pursue a career in the space sector . In response to this lack of structure, non-profit organizations such as the Space Generation Advisory Council (SGAC) are crucial to match the interests of the young community with those of the space industry. Students and young professionals see such an organization as a reference point for improving knowledge and gaining experience in projects embracing space exploration. Also, non-degree space programs, such as that of the International Institute for Astronautical Sciences, aim to support education in space fields to increase the chances of getting a space career. These organizations and programs bring a broad diversity of backgrounds and professionals who have a passion for space, leading research and communicating science to a more general audience. So, how is the role of educational institutions evolving in this context? This paper speculates on the gaps dividing education, research, and industry with the hypothesis that university programs are having challenges keeping up with the space industry’s requests and students’ expectations. In the long-term, such dissociation may make the university unnecessary for enabling access to specific jobs because it cannot provide the education needed for such a sector. Thus, to improve the space sector that is so viable to our society, there is a clear need to raise awareness about the implications of a fragmented link between education and industry, and bridge the gaps. Please note that the present abstract is submitted under the Space Generation Advisory Council’s auspices as part of the research conducted within the Space Exploration Project Group.",de Winter B.; Gastelum G.; Jamil Z.; Jagadam N.; Cinelli I.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2021-01-01,Manipal University Jaipur;Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam;International Institute for Astronautical Sciences;Space Generation Advisory Council (SGAC),Space education ;  Space Industry ;  STEM careers ;  Young professionals
DreamCoder 2.0: An Example of Digital Transformation for Education,"DreamCoder is a coding-in-space program in which students execute their own Python code on hardware on the International Space Station. The program guides students through team building, formulating research questions, designing code, and ultimately, analyzing and presenting results. This program was designed for small teams of students working collaboratively in the classroom. Specifically, multiple student teams connect via Wi-Fi to one ""Sagan Spacelab,” with the same sensors as the Sagan installed on the ISS. However, due to COVID-19, students began learning remotely, making the execution of programs like DreamCoder challenging or impossible. Recognizing the broad challenge of educating students during the pandemic, the European Space Agency (ESA) announced a funding opportunity entitled, “Space in Response to the COVID-19 Outbreak,” in collaboration with the Italian Minister for Technological Innovation and Digitalization, the Italian Space Agency, and other European Countries. Specifically, this opportunity asked applicants to leverage a space asset to assist Italian students impacted by the pandemic. Nanoracks Space Outpost Europe (Nanoracks-Europe), in collaboration with DreamUp, the developer of DreamCoder, and Rina Consulting, SpA, responded to this call and in July 2020, began development of “DreamCoder 2.0,” an upgraded version of DreamCoder with a virtual classroom to enable its use in remote learning. An initial pilot in Teggiano, Italy in September 2020, helped set the development team’s priorities. Four more schools from Bagheria in Siciliy, Ronciglione in Lazio, Novi Ligure in Liguria, and Brindisi in Puglia tested the first iteration of DreamCoder 2.0 in February and March 2021, and the development team used the schools’ feedback to further update the platform so that it is most useful for students and teachers’ current circumstance. The upgraded platform is more sensitive to the emerging user needs of schools, tech enthusiasts, and space fans. It directly enables an e-learning experience for stand-alone users as well as collaborative groups (i.e., a class, team, etc.).

The Role of the UAE New Space Science Centers in Promoting STEM Education,"Space education is considered the first step to be taken by any country seeking to establish space application capabilities through a basic space science program. For this reason, many developing countries have started running small space science facilities for research and education programs. The United Arab Emirates has seen the creation of several space science research centers. Among them, we can mention (1) Sharjah Academy for Astronomy, Space Sciences, and Technology (SAASST) at the University of Sharjah, (2) National Space Sciences and Technology Center (NSSTC) at the United Arab Emirates University, (3) Center for Space Science (CSS) at NYU Abu Dhabi, and (4) Khalifa University Space Technology Innovation Center (KUSTIC). All of these centers are now promoting space sciences and technology on all fronts through STEM education. STEM education (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) is becoming a primary concern for education and university curriculum policymakers to improve science and technology development. This has a significant impact on the workforce, countries' national security, and immigration policy worldwide. The interest in STEM education at all educational levels (primary, middle, high school, and university) is becoming essential to ensuring that students are well-versed in the necessary STEM knowledge to succeed in their workplace. In addition, students must be inspired to take on more challenging STEM subjects. This paper discusses the new UAE Space Sciences Centers' contribution and their programs to promoting STEM education. We focus on the Sharjah Academy for Astronomy, Space Sciences, and Technology through real-life space applications programs using ground-based and space research programs.",Fernini I.; Al-Naimiy H.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2021-01-01,"Sharjah Academy for Astronomy, Space Sciences & Technology;University of Sharjah",Research Laboratories ;  Space Centers ;  Space Technologies ;  STEM
Student Space Missions – Facilitating Pathways to Success for Next Generation Professionals in Space,"The Undergraduate Student Instrumentation Project (USIP) was a NASA program created to engage undergraduate students in rigorous scientific research for the purposes of innovation and developing the next generation of professionals in space research. It is now run by the University of Houston using local resources. This student-led project, based on the 5E instructional model, is executed by the students from initial ideation of research objectives to the design, testing, and deployment of scientific payloads. The 5E Instructional model places the student at the center of knowledge building, while instructors facilitate interaction with content and guide the inquiry process. Since 2013, this project has been not only an effective vehicle for delivering STEM education but is also effective in increasing classroom engagement and interest in space. Space research is inherently interdisciplinary and crosscuts Geoscience, Engineering, and Technology. The project is designed to integrate engineering, technology, physics, material science, and earth and atmospheric sciences as an important opportunity for the students to gain access to cross-disciplinary experiential research. In addition to classroom engagement, the students build their own payloads and ground instruments. This project increases students’ command of essential skills such as teamwork, collaboration, problem solving, technology, communication, innovation, and leadership. For the faculty, the project was an extended exercise in professional development, learning how to implement project level inquiry-based education on this scale. For the students, this formative experience continues to encourage the development of a much broader range of technical skills than is typically offered within an undergraduate degree. Furthermore, the extensive time and energy that students commit to this project promotes a strong sense of personal and professional responsibility and emphasizes the necessity of coherent teamwork. Not only do students make valuable connections with each other during this process, but also to the broader space science community. They often work with professionals from outside of the USIP structure, and regularly attend and present at conferences and student competitions throughout the project. This paper will present a web-based scaffolding used to simulate the traditional face to face 5E experience during COVID. Student projects have included subjects ranging from atmospheric trace gas chemistry, LiDAR study of snow and sand avalanche dynamics, auroral electron precipitation, gravity wave modulation of the hydroxyl layer, search for stratospheric microplastics, and monitoring auroral radio emissions, among others. This program is a for-credit course of two to three years duration.",Bering E.; Khan S.; Moges M.; Hampton D.; Mölders N.; Thorsen D.; Dunbar B.; Lefer B.; Gamblin R.; Greer M.; Greer P.; Gunawan B.; Hernandez E.; Lehnen J.; Nguyencuu A.; Piña M.; Porat I.; Prince J.; Pessoa A.; Simmons J.; Tovar C.; Ulinski A.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2021-01-01,Department of Computer Science;College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics;Cullen College of Engineering;College of Engineering;UT Southwestern Medical Center;National Aeronautics and Space Administration;University of Alaska Fairbanks;NASA Johnson Space Center;University of Pennsylvania;University of Houston,(curriculum development ;  Project-based learning ;  Spacecraft design)

The Architecture of a Safe Low Cost Earth Based Lunar Landing Test Bed for the Validation of Experimental Flight and new Technologies,"A propulsive landing on the surface of an extraterrestrial body requires a robust vehicle with a guidance, navigation and control (GNC) system that is reliable, efficient and repeatable. Developing algorithms for these systems involves the creation of a mathematical model to simulate reality, and the testing of physical hardware to validate the results produced by the simulations. Unique design considerations for the structures are required for off-nominal flight in 1G to avoid damage yet still allow the vehicle to re-fly quickly. The validation of experimental control algorithms requires the development of necessary infrastructure to iterate through a virtual to physical testing process, which is both time and cost intensive. The University of Southern California’s (USC) Space Engineering Research Center (SERC) in collaboration with the University of California at Berkeley (UCB) and the University of California at San Diego (UCSD) has developed such an infrastructure for an earth-based lunar landing test bed capable of validating experimental GNC algorithms with measures designed into both the hardware and software of the vehicle to mitigate failures in the event of off nominal flight conditions, allowing for innovative landing solutions to be repeatedly tested at a higher rate. The Lunar Entry Approach Platform For Research On the Ground (LEAPFROG) is a flight vehicle funded under a NASA Artemis STEM Competition Pilot award with the goal of supporting a nation-wide competition among universities. Powered by a central 300 N thrust turbine jet engine, the vehicle includes a cold gas attitude control system (ACS) to maintain stability, and a gimbal controlled by linear actuators to achieve thrust vector control (TVC) responsible for translation of the vehicle. Structurally, a number of innovations are built in for safety and reliability, including a composite based chassis and roll cage designed using Ansys Composite PrepPost (ACP) to support and protect the critical hardware, as well as a mechanical fuse allowing the frame and legs to avoid excessive loading in the event of a free fall. Additionally, the software architecture monitors competition teams’ inputs during flight that can override the controls and land the vehicle safely in the event of a policy violation. This paper will expand on the design and analyses of the features implemented in the structural and software designs that ensure a safe validation of innovative GNC algorithms on this lunar landing platform for use worldwide as a low-cost testbed for advanced technology testing.",Smat M.; Barnhart D.; Narain A.; Brieler I.; Gianousopolous D.; Sharad A.; Weingaertner R.; Wang H.; Orozco J.; Tran T.; Nagpal S.; Foster N.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2021-01-01,"University of California, San Diego;University of Southern California;University of California, Berkeley;Wichita State University",Control systems ;  Lander structures ;  Lunar lander ;  NASA Artemis Challenge
Didactic transformations of the distance educational process in universities in engineering in (Post) pandemic times,"As university education and, in particular, initial training of engineers are the priority directions of strategic development at the national and European level, in the current epidemiological conditions it is clear the need to support the digital transformation of the traditional engineering university education system into a valid one to be implemented remotely. In order to solve the problems listed above, within the call ""Offers of research-innovation solutions on combating and mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic"", launched by the National Agency for Research and Development (NARD) of the Republic of Moldova, a team of researchers from the Technical University of Moldova (TUM) initiated a project, called DIGIFORME, which aims to develop solutions of an institutional, informational and methodological nature corresponding to the curricular specificities of engineering and technological specialties within the beneficiary university, such as laboratories remote, simulation laboratories, methods and algorithms for analyzing the interaction between the actors of the teaching process, etc. This research comes with the description of a viable didactic model to be implemented in the educational process in universities in engineering both in a pandemic context and in a postpandemic context. The model design and analyzed by the author provides for the implementation of certain methodological digital transformations, the presence of which is argued both from a theoretical and applied perspective of teaching-learning-evaluation of engineering disciplines in a distance learning format. The solutions presented in the article are meant to reduce the vulnerabilities of a university with a profile in engineering education, such as the lack of a basis for carrying out distance work with students (from all types of studies); insufficient training of teachers for the full conduct of online lessons; the inadequacy of the informational and methodological support for the number of didactic activities specific to the specialties with engineering and technological profile.

How Leaders Can Shape the Oil & Gas Industry - Accelerating Innovations Through Business & Environmental Intelligent Systems,"One of the harms to climate brought about by anthropogenically instigated environmental change is the overabundance creation of CO2 because of industrialization. Research and development endeavors so far have been focused on the improvement of CCS (Carbon Capture and Sequestration), with the fundamental spotlight on the best way to eliminate CO2 from vent gases and how to cover it perpetually in deep aquifers or depleted oil and gas reservoirs to save the environment from the detrimental effects of CO2. At one side, the alarming situation due to excess emission of CO2 from industries has been bulled out and simultaneously, there is higher potential for CO2 in the depleted oil fields which can aid to the Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) through the prolonged CO2 injection in depleted oil fields. It is currently turning out to be certain that CCS technology could advance the utilization of fossil fuels than in any case recently thought. This paper discusses the integration of Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) technology with the progressive strategy of Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). CCS includes various advances that can be utilized to catch CO2 from point sources. Countries that are badly affected by the harmful effects of global warming with depleting oil reserves in the very near future can be the most viable target of the CCS Project. The scope and potential of different techniques of CCS along with the opportunities and challenges and the real case scenarios happening in the world are discussed in detail.

Research on digital collaborative management model of engineering projects based on BIM and IPD,"With the rapid development of the global economy and the continuous improvement of the economic system, engineering projects have become more market-oriented, the costs of engineering materials and construction machinery continue to rise, and the country advocates the concept of green building, which has put forward new requirements for engineering management. How to improve efficiency, the quality of project management and the management of information are all issues that need to be addressed urgently. With the gradual evolution of the delivery model of construction projects, the poor synergy between the various parties involved in the project under the traditional management model has led to poor project construction efficiency, which is increasingly unable to meet the needs of the industry. As a result, the project management concept under the traditional management mode has been backward, the degree of informatization is low and the collaboration and sharing is poor, which brings a lot of inconvenience to the project management. The emergence and rapid development of Building Information Modelling (BIM) can facilitate the work of project decision-makers and participants in information management and collaborative management. BIM technology is a modern information technology platform that enables the creation and use of parametric models for the design, construction and operation management of construction projects. It also allows for collaborative management between the customer, implementation and operation parties to achieve life-cycle management of the project.

PRODUCTIVITY MONITORING OF CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES USING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES: A LITERATURE REVIEW,"Although the engineering and construction sector is one of the largest in the world economy, it has historically been characterized by a low level of productivity and innovation. Traditional methods for productivity assessment at construction sites, despite being effective, are time-consuming and based on manual data collection and direct observation of activities on-site, which hampers the obtaining of reliable and up-to-date information of activities productivity. To contribute to future research in this area, this study aims to identify and analyze the main existing methods for measuring, analyzing, and improving productivity at construction sites using digital technologies, based on a systematic literature review. A total of 35 papers dated from 2010 to 2021 were selected using Scopus, ASCE Library, and Web of Science databases. Results show that technologies based on computer vision and sensors are the most used by researchers, being able to automate data collection for work sampling and activity analysis, measure inputs, outputs, and cycle times, and monitor factors that can influence workers' productivity. These technologies also have the potential to assist in the development of data collection methods for the assessment of productivity, ergonomics, and worker well-being. This integration, despite valuable, has been little explored in the literature.",da Barbosa A.; Costa D.,Conference Proceeding,IGLC 2021 - 29th Annual Conference of the International Group for Lean Construction - Lean Construction in Crisis Times: Responding to the Post-Pandemic AEC Industry Challenges,2021-01-01,Universidade Federal da Bahia,construction productivity ;  digital technologies ;  flow ;  time compression ;  Waste

Key technological advances and industrialization of continuous flow microwave processing for foods and beverages,"For several decades, researchers from the food processing industry, academia, and government institutions have recognized the shortcomings of conventional methods of food preservation for low acid, shelf stable food products. In order to deliver appropriately effective thermal treatments for inactivation of microbial targets (thermo-resistant endo-spores of proteolytic strains of Clostridium botulinum) and sufficient to achieve commercial sterility for low acid foods, these products need to be exposed to temperatures and pressures exceeding levels achievable under atmospheric conditions. These time-temperature treatment levels have been extensively researched and are consequently very well defined, widely known and extensively published in the scientific and professional literature on thermal food preservation. Continuous flow microwave processing is an advanced thermal processing technology used for heating and preservation of foods, beverages and biomaterials. In 1996 this technology became the focus of research and development efforts of the Food Process Engineering team at the Department of Food, Bioprocessing and Nutrition Sciences at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC. This chapter will provide a brief overview of the evolution of continuous flow microwave technologies as initiated by the research, development, and innovations conceptualized and implemented at the Department, start-up businesses, and industrial users of the resulting technologies, rationale for various system designs and the growing list of food, beverage, and biomaterial products introduced by industrial users of the technologies.",Simunovic J.; Sandeep K.,Book,Food Engineering Innovations Across the Food Supply Chain,2021-01-01,NC State University,Advanced thermal processing ;  Continuous flow ;  Food preservation ;  Microwave assisted aseptic processing ;  Microwave processing

MODELLING the KEY ENABLERS of ORGANIZATIONAL BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) IMPLEMENTATION: AN INTERPRETIVE STRUCTURAL MODELLING (ISM) APPROACH,"Building Information Modelling (BIM) implementation is a dynamic process and there are a number of influential variables that may change throughout. There is little research on the dynamics of the change environment and the AEC organizations approaches to BIM adoption and implementation. A considerable number of BIM enablers have been identified and/or developed in the extant literature. However, stipulating BIM implementation enablers per se provides only a static view that is not adequate for describing effective management of BIM implementation in Architectural, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) organizations. This study is the second part of an ongoing research about BIM implementation enablers. In the first paper ""Building Information Modelling (BIM) adoption and implementation enablers in AEC firms: A systematic literature review"" (Abbasnejad et al., 2020) the organizational BIM enablers have been identified. The aim of this second paper is to (1) further review and validate the key BIM implementation enablers using both the existing literature and expert interviews, and (2) develop a structural model of the key enablers using the ISM technique to understand the mutual interaction of these enablers and identify the driving enablers and the dependent enablers. Twenty-eight enablers for BIM implementation were initially identified from the literature and subsequent discussion with experts from academia and industry has been conducted to select most key BIM implementation enablers. Eleven enablers were finally chosen based on the literature review and expert interviews and the Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) technique has been adopted to evaluate the contextual interrelationships among them. MICMAC (Matrix Impacts Cross-reference Multiplication Applied to a Classification) analysis was employed to classify the eleven enablers based on their dependence and driving power. The results indicate that there is no enabler in the autonomous cluster and this therefore signifies that all enablers are required for the implementation of BIM. BIM leadership and top management support have been identified as the enablers with the highest driving power in the initial stages of the BIM adoption and implementation process and for that reason, these enablers demand a greater priority given that there are other dependent enablers that will be impacted.",Abbasnejad B.; Nepal M.; Mirhosseini S.; Moud H.; Ahankoob A.,Journal,Journal of Information Technology in Construction,2021-01-01,"RMIT University, School of Property, Construction and Project Management;Iran University of Science and Technology;Queensland University of Technology;Florida Gulf Coast University",building information modelling ;  business process change management ;  construction management ;  innovation implementation ;  ISM approach

Research on Photovoltaic Cell Models: A Review,"To carry on the theoretical analysis and practice verification to the photovoltaic (PV) power generation system, the accurate model of the PV cell should be established first. Nowadays, a large number of scholars at home and abroad have carried out research on PV systems and PV cells, and have made a lot of breakthroughs and innovations in mathematical and circuit model optimization, maximum power point tracking (MPPT), and parameter extraction methods of PV cells. However, the model used cannot be completely compatible with the required precision, computational complexity, and environmental conditions. In this paper, the circuit models, mathematical models, and parameter extraction method of nine commonly used PV cells are reviewed, and the engineering simplified model and shading model of PV cells are reviewed. The above are the steady-state models of PV cells, but the maximum power point tracking is a dynamic optimization process. Therefore, the dynamic characteristics of PV cells (especially the small-signal output impedance) are summarized in this paper. Then a method is proposed which is different from the traditional PV cell model classification, that is to say, all the above models are nonlinear PV cells, which need complex iteration and calculation to extract parameters and research.

Eco-friendly Metal Matrix Composites,"Metal matrix composites are the class of materials that have received great attention in the past decade owing to their superior specific properties and huge promise of application in various fields like aerospace, automotive, engineering, biomedical, and electronic applications. Suitable structural metal matrix (Mg, Zn, Ti) are reinforced with high-performance reinforcements to improve the mechanical, microstructural, corrosion, and tribological properties of the matrix. The ease of processing at controlled cost is encouraging commercial industries to transition from conventional alloys to metal matrix composites. The need for innovation in this field is gaining widespread acceptance due to the high potential displayed by these materials to serve multifunctional requirements. A special class of metal matrix composites called Eco-friendly metal matrix composites is appropriate for aiding in these efforts. In this technology, materials are developed by using cost-effective processing methodologies, non-toxic and inexpensive reinforcements, or a combination of both to develop high-performance metal matrix composites. This article briefly discusses the efforts made by the research community in this class of environmentally friendly materials.",Parande G.; Manakari V.; Gupta M.,Book,Encyclopedia of Materials: Composites,2021-01-01,National University of Singapore,Corrosion ;  Eco-friendly ;  Economically conscious ;  Environmentally conscious ;  Low cost ;  Magnesium ;  Mechanical properties ;  Metal matrix composites ;  Microstructure ;  Titanium ;  Tribology ;  Zinc
Technological Environmental Education in the Arab World: Case of Kingdom of Bahrain,"Technology's influence on the environment is evident. It is linked to electricity. Visually, environmental issues are filling the World with abandoned equipment situations and rapid obsolescence of electronics goods. Most of the World is buying what they already have. Consumption control systems say it all. However, the recycling idea built on savings concepts can help save the day. Naturally, the technology is in favor of batteries, while diesel is still dominating. Shifting the power to the sun will not be easy. Resorting to the sun as the main source of energy needs diligent work. The road is fraught with difficulties, but there are signs of a transition to solar energy. This is apparent with the adoption of cars and most devices! The 'solar air conditioner' remains a key puzzle in the energy transformation of the earth's recovery. Until the atmosphere returns to the maximum reasonable extent of oxygen, a person will be able to change the status quo by perfecting the charging of batteries through sunlight. Several modern and traditional methods explain this process accurately. The application and innovation remain to extend the traditional means, such as the use of lenses to diffuse light and make fire of palm leaves. We do not call for burning the woods, but rather we demand to prevent cutting to live on it, but we demand to preserve it and live under its shade. We hope to bequeath to the light to our children, so we sow in their life. This can be done by imposing green energy on education. Environmental awareness is very crucial in the process. Schools and universities hold the grounds for the kick-off. This research links technology, environment, and education. A literature review provided centered on environmental change to raise the awareness of youngsters. The finding of this research concludes that there is a lack of environmental change topics in education systems in the Arab World. Seventy universities from the Middle East websites were visited. Bachelor of Science Programs in the environment were looked at. Climate Change is not categorized as a priority in universities' curricula across the Arab World. This can be achieved through opening a wide range of programs in the environmental Sciences. Simply, environmental awareness requires more attention in the region.",Salman N.; Mustafa M.; Al-Shaalan A.; Al-Mannai M.,Conference Proceeding,2021 3rd International Sustainability and Resilience Conference: Climate Change,2021-01-01,University of Technology Bahrain;Ahlia University;University of Bahrain,awareness ;  Climate Change ;  education ;  Kingdom of Bahrain ;  technology
Two-dimensional animation interactive demonstration teaching system based on multimedia technology - -artificial intelligence and information technology,"With the development and innovation of computer technology and the heavy research of media, A multimedia technology that can interact with computers in real-time information has appeared. It is the technology of industrial life and education. On the other hand, this promotes the extent of computer applications and combines multimedia technologies in education. This is new. The development of the world is a way of finding new factors and increasing learning. An animation technology as a product plays an incomplete role in the production of the multimedia cursors. As we all know, the multimedia materials developed by Flash software are known for their exquisite two-dimensional animations. However, it is more difficult to implement interactive two-dimensional molecular model demonstrations in Flash. Combining the current animation technology and database technology, this article has conducted an in-depth study on it, and designed a set of interactive multimedia teaching system based on two-dimensional animation technology. This article first introduces the basic principles of animation technology and the implementation of interactive information platforms. On this basis, the system's hierarchical structure and development process are analyzed, and the main work is divided into two key parts. On the one hand, it uses animation technology to design and t make vivid, feasible and interactive teaching courseware, on the other hand, to build an interactive information management teaching platform combined with database principles.",Zhu X.; Ma F.; Wang Z.,Conference Proceeding,"2021 IEEE Conference on Telecommunications, Optics and Computer Science, TOCS 2021",2021-01-01,Weifang Engineering Vocational College,Interaction ;  Multimedia technology ;  Teaching system ;  Two-dimensional animation
Collaborative decision-making in software research projects: The innovation challenge,"Innovation has the potential to propel organizations to unprecedented levels of performance and to strengthen their competitive advantage. Collaboration plays a significant role in boosting the innovation capabilities and reaching performance goals. Improving collaboration brings substantial overall benefits ranging from faster internal decision making, reduced costs through shared resources, and the development of more innovative products. The COViD-10 outbreak has radically altered traditional collaboration and teamwork patterns, requiring new approaches that would nurture creativity, engagement, and motivation at team level, and that would also streamline decision-making processes. This paper investigates the use of a collaborative platform that can enhance teamwork achievements and decision-making capabilities and presents an analysis of experiments carried out within software research projects. The approach considers key challenges in today's global and fast-changing research and business environments that demand improvements in collaboration among functions ranging from R&D to distribution.

Cryogenic cooling-based sustainable machining,"In parallel with the development of science and technology, usage and requirements of different materials have increased. Engineering materials undergo machining when developing engineered products from them. Machining of some of the typical materials such as titanium, nickel, stainless steel, composites, etc. is challenging due to their inherent properties. High friction, temperature generation, and cutting forces lead to shorter tool life, deterioration in work surface quality, higher consumption of energy and resources, and negative environmental impacts. Hydrocarbon cutting fluid-based conventional flood cooling is not capable enough to overcome the machining challenges such as the aforementioned and adversely affect the environment. It compelled to explore some alternate cooling and lubrication strategies, and hence, minimum quantity lubrication, dry cutting, and cryogenic cooling have been developed. These are the sustainable cooling and lubrication strategies. This chapter presents a detailed insight on cryogenic cooling and its utilization in machining. It also reports the effectiveness of this technique with the help of some literature discussion pertaining to specific materials. The chapter aims to encourage researchers for future research, development, and innovations in this direction to attain sustainability in machining.",Cagan S.; Buldum B.,Book,Sustainable Manufacturing,2021-01-01,Mersin Üniversitesi,Cryogenic cooling ;  Cutting fluid ;  Environment ;  Machinability ;  Sustainability ;  Tool wear

'Engineering for Global Development' in Academic Institutions: An Initial Review of Learning Opportunities Across Four Global Regions,"Engineering for Global Development (EGD) is a growing field in which technology development, design research, and implementation sciences are utilized to support communities worldwide and improve their quality of life. The study area is known by various terminologies worldwide, such as 'global engineering,' 'frugal engineering,' 'sustainable development engineering,' 'humanitarian engineering,' and so on. This report aims to provide an initial overview of the breadth of EGD-related opportunities available at universities through a series of regional reviews in four major global regions: (1) Canada and the United States, (2) Australia and New Zealand, (3) Latin America, and (4) Asia. In addition to documenting the types of EGD programs offered at academic institutions, we aim to analyze the ways in which EGD-related educational opportunities are offered across the specified global regions. Importantly, we review and compare common terminologies used in each region. Across the regions explored, we identified 85 intuitions with various EGD-related learning opportunities, primarily in the form of experiential learning and research opportunities. Some universities offer degrees and certificates, but the quantity of degree-granting programs remains relatively small. Future work should explore this increase in demand and quality of available training, especially relevant to SDG 4: Quality Education. Our findings indicate that a robust EGD academic community exists globally. Notably, institutions use a variety of terminologies, and similarities and differences in their usage exist regionally. Ultimately, this report aims to comprehensively review the many terminologies, programs (e.g., undergraduate courses, masters, postgraduate, and innovation centers), and research groups dedicated to EGD-related academic work across the four regions specified. The findings from this study contribute to the growing literature and efforts to expand EGD endeavors and collaborations in academic institutions globally.",Burleson G.; MacHado M.; Aranda I.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of 2021 World Engineering Education Forum/Global Engineering Deans Council, WEEF/GEDC 2021",2021-01-01,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor;Engineering for Change, LLC",Engineering Education ;  Engineering for Global Development ;  Humanitarian Engineering ;  Social Innovation

MATILDA Latin American Open Chair: An international cooperation initiative to increase women in engineering,"Participation of women in engineering fields has been acquiring a global perspective of primary importance in society. However, women have less presence in STEM areas than in other disciplines, such as education, health, social sciences, and arts. Incorporating women into engineering is a long road, which requires first, unfailingly young women with a deep passion for these careers and a strong will to pursue their university careers and achieve a professional degree. It is precisely with this motivation that the Latin American Open Chair 'Matilda and women in engineering' (CAL Matilda, for its acronym in Spanish) arises, a regional cooperation initiative for increasing women in engineering. CAL Matilda represents a joint effort of three founding governing institutions: the Federal Council of Deans of Engineering of Argentina-CONFEDI, the Colombian Association of Engineering Faculties-ACOFI and the Latin American and Caribbean Consortium of Engineering Institutions-LACCEI. Their objective is to create an academic space for debate, reflection, collective construction of knowledge, teaching, research and carrying out activities that stimulate and promote equal rights, opportunities, and spaces for women in the academic and professional fields, and for the promotion of engineering vocations in girls and young people in Latin America and the Caribbean.",Giordano-Lerena R.; Larrondo-Petrie M.; Paez-Pino A.; Rathmann L.; Romero-Robles L.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of 2021 World Engineering Education Forum/Global Engineering Deans Council, WEEF/GEDC 2021",2021-01-01,FAU College of Engineering and Computer Science;Universidad FASTA de la Fraternidad de Agrupaciones Santo Tomas de Aquino;Tecnológico de Monterrey;Universidad Atlantida Argentina;Gedc Latam,Educational Innovation ;  Higher Education ;  International Cooperation ;  Women in Engineering ;  Women in STEM
The shift to online and blended learning at an engineering school: Feedback and results,"ISAE-Supmeca is a French engineering school located in the north of the great Paris area. It has been engaged since decades in active learning, especially problem-and project-based learning. During the last ten years, ISAE-Supmeca has gained experience in leading or participating in several French and European educational research projects. This led to the set-up of an Educational Innovation Unit, at the interface of teachers and learners. Among other tasks and in collaboration with teachers, this unit coordinates and participates in several educational research projects, maps issues encountered in the learning process, assists teachers and proposes new educational tools. As well as all scientific and technical higher education institutions, ISAE-Supmeca has been impacted by the covid-19 pandemic situation. The experience of problem-and project-based learning helped the institution and its actors to quickly adapt to a full remote education (online), then to a partly remote education (blended for some modules), but it was not without any issues. So, a follow-up with surveys and analysis took place in order to map the main issues, the solutions adopted and the evolution of the situation. The main goal of this data collection and analysis is to formalize feedback, extract results and then have grounds to better implement the mid-or long-term adaptations, i.e. carry out a three-phase work: reaction, analysis and action. All ISAE-Supmeca teachers and learners were asked several times for feedback on their experience during the pandemic period and their participation made this analysis and this paper possible.",Lanthony A.; Kooli-Chaabane H.; Peyret N.; Boukare A.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of 2021 World Engineering Education Forum/Global Engineering Deans Council, WEEF/GEDC 2021",2021-01-01,ISAE-Supméca;Université Paris Nanterre,blended education ;  feedback ;  online ;  remote

Decolonial Ethics in Training in Computational Engineering. A Qualitative Study of Professors' and Students' Perspectives,"We present an exploratory study that aims to diagnose the Engineering in Computational Technologies students' level of awareness with respect to the impact of the accelerated use of technology and the exponential growth that private socio-digital platforms have in everyday life because of the COVID-19 confinement. We research possible deterministic postures in the students' positions that could impede their ethical analysis of the social and environmental effects of the advance of data capitalism, among which racialization, algorithmic sexualization, and discrimination, as well as the erosion of the Commons on the Internet, stand out. The theoretical approach comes from a decolonial ethical framework, and the methodology of this study is qualitative. It consists of, in the first phase of the implementation, two focus groups with engineering students between the ages of 19 and 22 from different semesters and genders. In a second phase, we include eight in-depth interviews with professors from the School of Engineering and the School of Humanities who teach disciplinary and general education subjects in two campuses of a private university in Mexico.",Concepcion Castillo-Gonzalez M.; Luisa Sanchez-Hernandez A.; Lugo N.; Perez-Lezama C.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of 2021 World Engineering Education Forum/Global Engineering Deans Council, WEEF/GEDC 2021",2021-01-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,critical thinking ;  data capitalism ;  decoloniality ;  educational innovation ;  Ethics ;  higher education ;  professional education

Higher Education 4.0: The Digital Transformation of Classroom Lectures to Blended Learning,"This book chronicles a 10-year introduction of blended learning into the delivery at a leading technological university, with a longstanding tradition of technology-enabled teaching and learning, and state-of-the-art infrastructure. Hence, both teachers and students were familiar with the idea of online courses. Despite this, the longitudinal experiment did not proceed as expected. Though few technical problems, it required behavioural changes from teachers and learners, thus unearthing a host of socio-technical issues, challenges, and conundrums. With the undercurrent of design ideals such as “tech for good”, any industrial sector must examine whether digital platforms are credible substitutes or at best complementary. In this era of Industry 4.0, higher education, like any other industry, should not be about the creative destruction of what we value in universities, but their digital transformation. The book concludes with an agenda for large, repeatable Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) to validate digital platforms that could fulfil the aspirations of the key stakeholder groups – students, faculty, and regulators as well as delving into the role of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) as surrogates for “fees-free” higher education and whether the design of such a HiEd 4.0 platform is even a credible proposition. Specifically, the book examines the data-driven evidence within a design-based research methodology to present outcomes of two alternative instructional designs evaluated – traditional lecturing and blended learning. Based on the research findings and statistical analysis, it concludes that the inexorable shift to online delivery of education must be guided by informed educational management and innovation.",Jones K.; Sharma R.,Book,Higher Education 4.0: The Digital Transformation of Classroom Lectures to Blended Learning,2021-01-01,Zayed University;Center for Inclusive Digital Enterprise (CeIDE),Blending learning ;  Classroom management ;  Data collection ;  Data structures ;  Digital enterprise ;  Digital transformation ;  Educational statistics ;  Educational technology ;  Higher Education ;  Innovation ;  Institution management ;  LAMS ;  Learning Activity Management System ;  learning technology ;  School management ;  software engineering ;  Statistical modelling

Accelerating the Development of Complex Systems in Aeronautics via MBSE and MDAO: a Roadmap to Agility,"The ever-increasing complexity of systems under development in aerospace is demanding to streamline and accelerate the development of innovative products, across the diverse disciplines, and throughout the entire life-cycle. The European funded research and innovation AGILE project introduced a novel paradigm to Multidisciplinary Design Analysis and Optimization (MDAO) processes, shortening the setup time of MDAO systems to more than 40%, with respect to conventional MDAO approaches. However, AGILE project scope was limited to the design and the optimization of the aircraft product itself, for a given set of design requirements and for a given architecture. The follow-up European funded project AGILE4.0 expands the scope, including also the upstream systems engineering phases of the development life-cycle, within the trade-off and optimization activities. This work introduces the conceptual framework under development, which leverages digital engineering approaches and in particular Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). The focus of the framework is on accelerating the setup, deployment and operation of MBSE systems, as well as on streamlining the integration with MDAO system, to in turn accelerate the development of aircraft products. The focus of the framework is on the bridge between MDAO and MBSE. The paper also introduces the on-going investigations which make use of the framework and are collaboratively performed by the Consortium consisting of 18 International Organizations.",Ciampa P.; Nagel B.,Conference Proceeding,"AIAA Aviation and Aeronautics Forum and Exposition, AIAA AVIATION Forum 2021",2021-01-01,Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR),
EDUCATING HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES INNOVATORS ABOUT THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF INNOVATION BY THE CUSTOMER DISCOVERY PROCESS,"Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) innovators lag behind their non-HBCU counterparts in the commercialization of innovations as they were originally set up as teaching and blue-collar trade institutions. There exists a strong need for education and training to bridge this gap by promoting the commercialization of innovations in HBCUs and thus transform next-generation HBCU innovators into entrepreneurs. HBCUs are promoting entrepreneurial education and mindset via changes in engineering education programs and curriculums. Several federally funded programs like the National Science Foundation (NSF) Center of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) Center for Nanotechnology Research Excellence (CNRE) are promoting innovation and intellectual property generation a t HBCUs. NSF I-Corps Program supports the education and training of innovators about the commercialization of mature or patented innovations at HBCUs. The NSF I-Corps Introduction to Customer Discovery explores strategies in identifying key customer segments through extensive customer interviews, which is a fundamental step in the commercialization p rocess. This paper discusses our educational experience in the customer discovery process for Pumpless Solar Thermal Air Heater (Patent Number 10775058). To learn about prospective customers’ attitudes and perceptions of the innovation, we conducted 30 interviews with potential customers (end users). Our innovation is focused on providing portable, cost-effective, healthy, and environmentally friendly space heating solutions. We tested several hypotheses about the value proposition of our innovation during interviews to explore the market segments for potential commercialization. During the Customer Discovery process, we came to know about new issues such as health issues caused by the dry air in winter. We also learned that mitigation of problems due to the current heating system required a humidifier to reduce health issues that added additional cost. Based on our interviews our innovation is suitable for customers needing: (i) Heating source mitigating health issues, (ii) add-on technology to reduce their heating bills. Our next step is to pursue market segments for our innovation. We plan to utilize the current experience of commercialization of intellectual property to develop training modules for the MECH 302 Undergraduate Research Experience and MECH 500 Research Methods and Technical Communication courses offered under the mechanical engineering program at the University of the District of Columbia (UDC).",Addo S.; Tyagi P.; Shetty D.,Conference Proceeding,"ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, Proceedings (IMECE)",2021-01-01,University of the District of Columbia,Commercialization of innovations ;  Customer Discovery ;  Engineering Teaching ;  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)
GREENER ATM SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE RESEARCH BASED ON COMPLEX SYSTEM ENGINEERING METHOD,"Greener aviation has gradually become a development trend of global air transportation industry, which is crucial for achieving sustainable development goals. The realization of greener aviation urgently requires innovation at the level of air traffic operation. Traditional air traffic management is mainly based on the premise of ensuring the safety of aircraft operations, with the goal of maximizing the utilization of airport and airspace service capabilities, paying less attention to the environmental impact induced by air traffic management strategy implementation. The future greener ATM system will focus on energy conservation and emission reduction. Through the implementation of new concepts, technologies and methods such as advanced surface management, continuous climb/descend operation, and collaborative decision-making, the airspace structure, flight trajectory and procedures will be optimized to realize the development requirements of greener aviation. The research on greener ATM system architecture is necessary to identify the characteristics of greener air traffic operation and to clarify the stakeholder requirements and system capability requirements for greener ATM system. It is also a prerequisite for the research of key technologies for greener ATM and avionic systems. As a typical complex system, the greener ATM system has the following characteristics: 1) multi-business and multi-node, involving the mutual cooperation and information exchange among multiple subsystems such as aircraft, satellites, and ground stakeholders; 2) each subsystem can play its own role and operate independently of other systems; 3) dynamic system which includes a large number of emergent behaviors; 4) central-radiation or distributed network topology which defines the connection among various nodes. Therefore, the analysis of this system requires the selection of appropriate system engineering methods, frameworks, and modeling processes to clearly and accurately reflect system functions and behaviors. The traditional architecture design approach is a document-centric system engineering method. This method extracts information from multifarious documents, causing divergence in understanding of different designers, and it requires too many iterative processes, which is difficult for information tracking and management. The model-based system engineering (MBSE) method avoids the vagueness and ambiguity caused by document via using the object-oriented, graphical and visualized system modeling language to describe the system, and has good consistency, verifiability and traceability. This paper proposes a greener ATM system architecture design and development process based on MBSE method. According to analysis of new concepts of air traffic operations for green aviation, areas of change and enhancement beyond existing air traffic operations are identified. Typical greener operation scenarios that implement the above concepts are constructed for long-haul and short-haul operations, and new requirements proposed by various stakeholders under these scenarios are analyzed. Based on the operation scenarios and requirements, the procedures of each flight phase and the information exchange pattern among the operational nodes are identified from the operation perspective, to establish the operational view models. The system composition and system functions of the greener ATM system are defined from the system perspective, and the mapping relationship between system functions and operational activities is created, to establish the system view models. These models include high-level operational concept diagrams, sequence diagrams, state-machine diagrams, etc. Through the development of these architecture models, the requirements of the ATM system supporting greener aviation operational concepts are clearly defined, which provides guidance for the subsequent research of key technologies. Compared with the traditional method, the MBSE-based greener air traffic management system development process has the following advantages: 1) the model decomposition process helps to explore more details in the system; 2) the model-based architecture analysis can guarantee the consistency in different views; 3) architecture analysis can predict and analyze the emergent behaviors of the system.",Hu H.; Mao J.; Hu D.,Conference Proceeding,"32nd Congress of the International Council of the Aeronautical Sciences, ICAS 2021",2021-01-01,China Aeronautical Radio Electronics Research Institute;CAAC;National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Avionics System Integration,ATM system architecture ;  Greener aviation ;  Model-based system engineering
Research on Spatial-Temporal Differentiation and Driving Forces of Green Economic Efficiency in the Yangtze River Economic Belt Based on Geographic Detectors,"The research is based on the undesirable super-efficiency EBM model to measure the GEE of 108 cities in the YREB from 2003 to 2018, uses Geographical Information System to characterize the temporal and spatial evolution of the GEE, and applies the geographic detector model to further reveal the spatial heterogeneity of its driving forces. The results show that: (1)The GEE of the YREB took 2013 as the inflection point, showing two phases of volatility decline period and rapid rise period, and reflecting the spatial differentiation characteristics of 'upstream-midstream-downstream' urban agglomeration. (2)The core driving forces for the improvement of GEE in the YREB include urbanization, consumption level, financial industry development, technological innovation and Internet penetration rate.(3)The local scale of the driving forces for GEE improvement is significantly different. The core driving forces of the upstream are education investment, urbanization, Internet penetration rate and transportation infrastructure; and education investment, industrial structure and city scale in the midstream; and industrial structure, consumption, technological innovation, economic development level in the downstream. Therefore, upstream, midstream, and downstream must seek to adapt to the situation and local conditions to improve the GEE.",Liu S.; Song L.; Huang Y.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2021 International Conference on Intelligent Computing, Automation and Applications, ICAA 2021",2021-01-01,Ocean University of China,n/a
SUPPORTING INNOVATIVE BEHAVIOR: AN EVALUATION OF SOCIAL SUPPORT FACTORS RELATED TO INDIVIDUAL INNOVATIVE BEHAVIOR IN SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS,"Individual scientists and engineers are key contributors of innovation in research and development organizations. In today's environment, organizational leaders and managers have an important responsibility to shape the organizational structure and culture in a way that encourages individual innovative behavior. Recent research has investigated the relationship between the social environment within an organization and individual behaviors related to the generation, promotion, and implementation of new ideas. Previous studies have focused on supervisor and co-worker relationship quality or on the characteristics of an individual's social network and how those factors encourage or impede innovative behavior. This prior research confirms the influence of the organizational social environment, but additional research is needed to better understand how innovative behavior is influenced by that social environment. To do this, we operationalize the content of social interactions in an organization as three types of social support: emotional support, informational support, and legitimacy support. We present a review of the innovative behavior literature and present a research methodology to study the relationship between individual innovative behavior and these different types of social support. Finally, we present preliminary results from a pilot study with university engineering students and discuss the implications for the full research study with professional scientists and engineers in a large government funded research and development organization.",Bailey J.; Gholston S.,Conference Proceeding,"2021 ASEM Virtual International Annual Conference ""Engineering Management and The New Normal""",2021-01-01,The University of Alabama in Huntsville,Emotional support ;  Information support ;  Innovation ;  Innovative behavior ;  Legitimacy support ;  Social support
Evaluation System of BIM Application Ability Based on Engineering Information Design,"In order to more intuitively evaluate the application ability of BIM in engineering informatization design, this paper constructs an AHP evaluation model to comprehensively evaluate the informatization application depth of engineering projects. The overall model evaluates the application capability of information design from five dimensions: information management and control, technical operation, organization and management, comprehensive benefits, and potential innovation. The research results show that the two dimensions of information and technology have a more significant impact on the overall evaluation. The evaluation method has good operability and certain scientificity.",Zhou Y.; Cao Y.; Xu J.; Zhang Y.; Zhang W.,Conference Proceeding,"2021 4th International Symposium on Traffic Transportation and Civil Architecture, ISTTCA 2021",2021-01-01,Ltd.,AHP model ;  BIM application ;  Component ;  Engineering project ;  Evaluation system
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC GROWTH: A LITERATURE REVIEW,"Economic growth is a complex topic that consists of many different factors. The effect of research and development (R&D) on economic growth has increased in importance since the shift from a primarily manufacturing based economy that evolved from th e Industrial Revolution to a knowledge-based economy that is characterized by a focus on innovation to achieve increased productivity. A pioneer of endogenous growth theory, Paul Romer's paper “Endogenous Technological Change” directed the conversation of economic growth from a Malthusian perspective focused on population growth to a perspective of inclusivity. This shift occurred due to the expansive nature of ideas by recognizing that, as an input, technology is a nonrival, partially excludable good. This paper reviews the role of R&D, the endogenous characteristics of technological growth, and studies the relationship between R&D and economic growth. In addition, this paper explores the strengths and potential downfalls of the current research trends in this area and the impact this research has on industrial and systems engineering.",Jenkins K.; Beruvides M.,Conference Proceeding,"2021 ASEM Virtual International Annual Conference ""Engineering Management and The New Normal""",2021-01-01,Texas Tech University,Development ;  Economics of Knowledge ;  Endogenous growth ;  Knowledge-oriented ;  Public policy ;  Research
Human perception and neurocognitive development across the lifespan,"Humans interact with the environments through their senses. Since Helmholtz’s classical concept, it is well known in psychology and cognitive neuroscience that human perception and action are influenced by an individual’s prior sensory and learning experiences, as well as by other factors, such as task-specific goals or contexts. Focusing on human perception and action as one of the target primary research fields for the new transdisciplinary research of Tactile Internet with Human-in-the-Loop (TaHiL), this chapter reviews neurocognitive processes for multisensory perception, as well as how these processes are affected by age-related effects across the lifespan and individual differences. Neural information processing in brain circuitries that underlie the different senses not only operate very fast (on the order of <20 ms), but also at very different speeds. Whereas hearing and seeing operate, respectively, in the range of 3 ms or 15 ms, the tactile sense operates in the 1 ms time range. Furthermore, neuronal gain control of neural information processing and uncertainty reduction are key mechanisms of human multisensory perception. Empirical data from lifespan developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience show that the one-size-fits-all assumption, which is commonly adopted in the engineering fields, cannot by default be applied to user populations covering broad age ranges. Empirical evidence indicates that mechanisms of brain development and aging can substantially impact neuronal gain control with consequences for the speed and robustness of human perception and action. Furthermore, prominent age-related differences pertaining to the development and aging of the frontal-parietal brain network affect multiple cognitive functions, such as attention, executive control, and valuation. These effects on cognition would further influence goal-directed multisensory perception and action across the lifespan. Thus the Human-in-the-Loop approach emphasized by the research of TaHiL requires systematic investigations of the effects of development, aging, and skill acquisition on the dynamic interplay between multisensory perception, goal anticipation, and action. Basic experimental research with population-based samples is indispensable for understanding age- and expertise-sensitive psychophysical and neurocognitive factors. Such knowledge can guide theoretical developments of computational models as well as engineering innovations of key technologies (e.g., sensors and actuators, data coding and compression methods, communication networks and human-inspired machine learning) for the advancement of next generation quasi-real-time human-machine interactions in the Tactile Internet.",Li S.; Muschter E.; Limanowski J.; Hatzipanayioti A.,Book,Tactile Internet: with Human-in-the-Loop,2021-01-01,Technische Universität Dresden,Aging ;  Bayesian inference ;  Development ;  Gain control ;  Individual differences ;  Learning ;  Multisensory ;  Neural information processing ;  Neuromodulation ;  Perception
Research on design method of public building entrance,"Structural engineering of entrances for public buildings must not only comply with the requirements of building technologies, but it must also comply with the aesthetical conceptions concerning the manner of location of various building components not only within the building site. In this connection, it is very important to find out the solution concerning the manner, which is to be applied in order to form architectural and space-planning solutions for the building of the public destination. Novelty of the article represents formulation of the mathematical model, which makes it possible to design spaces within the public building in accordance with the principles of free and unobstructed location of visitors. Practical application of this research is to be considered as the category of the innovation architectural forms in the course of structural engineering of buildings. The main direction of the research will be formed at the expense of application of the non-standard forms of the structural engineering in the buildings of the public destination, as well as in the course of reconstruction of any business institutions.

The Application of Flow-Based Programming to the Code Generation of Simulation Models,"The United States (US) Army has created countless models across many simulation systems. These models have varying levels of fidelity and resolution depending on the use case for the simulation. A serious challenge for the US Army is that these models are rarely reused or even reproducible because of the varied simulation technical implementations. This results in models being reimplemented or recreated for each new simulation system required by the US Army. The US Army Combat Capabilities Development Command - Soldier Center (DEVCOM SC) initiated the Generative Programming project to research techniques and technologies for representing US Army models in a simulation agnostic manner that can execute within various simulation environments. The initial work from this effort was presented at last year's Simulation Innovation Workshop (SIW) 2020 where we described: 1) the creation of a canonical format for capturing datatypes and logic of models produced by a graphical development platform; 2) the ingestion process of this format into a code generation system; and, 3) producing executable libraries for use in simulations. The Code Generation effort is now in its second year of execution and has expanded to new thrusts along with some technical successes and lessons identified. A primary thrust has been exploring a new graphical modeling environment utilizing node or flow-based programming. A particular goal for this approach is to provide a model development environment that is more intuitive for Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and less tied to an imperative programming paradigm. The research effort informed several new features to the canonical format and backend code generator, as well as reworking of several existing capabilities. The resultant prototype was leveraged to produce numerous new models and integrate some models into multiple simulation systems. This paper describes the progress made over the last year with the change in the graphical modeling paradigm, including successes and lessons identified on the canonical format, generation and integration use cases, and a newly formed collaboration with Normalized Systems Theory (NST) engineers that has resulted in an international publication.",McGroarty C.; Metevier C.; Gallant S.; Gallogly J.; Snively K.; Raval A.,Conference Proceeding,"2021 Virtual Simulation Innovation Workshop, SIW 2021",2021-01-01,Effective Applications Corporation;Simulation and Training Technology Center,Code generation ;  Flow-based programming ;  Model-driven engineering ;  Simulation
A TEXT CLASSIFICATION ANALYSIS OF TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION MANAGEMENT PUBLICATIONS USING SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING,"This paper aims to illustrate how Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used to classify research publications relevant to Technology and Innovation Management (TIM).

DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES AND THE WORLD OF THE FUTURE: IMPLICATIONS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF TECHNOLOGY,"Purpose of the paper This paper studies the impact of digital technologies on the world of the future and implications for the Management of Technology (MOT). The deployment of digital technologies (e.g. social media, virtual communication infrastructure including Internet-of-things for hyper-connectivity, 3D printing, cloud services, big data analytics and artificial intelligence) in various industries and in the public sector is transforming innovation and competition rapidly. The paper examines two questions: (1) How do digital technologies transform industries and create the world of the future? (2) What are the implications for MOT? The paper draws on the literature on digitalization (Kagerman et al., 2013; Frank et al., 2019), ecosystem theory (Chertow, 2001; Holling, 1996; Iansiti and Richards, 2006), smart manufacturing, and Industry 4.0, which relies on digital technologies such as the Internet-of-Things (IOT), artificial intelligence to improve decision making and save costs (OECD, 2019), cloud services, big data and analytics to gather, store and analyze data in real time for decision making in various applications (Wang et al., 2015; Frank et al., 2019). These technologies enable digital transformation from physical to cyber-physical systems and accelerate the creation of linkages across entities - individuals, companies and nations. The paper also uses the definition of Management of Technology (MoT) by Botha (2020) and Bennett (2020) who note that MoT in the digital era involves the integration of science, engineering and management to augment intelligence in technology based organizations to create socio-technical ecosystems that provide dynamic benefits over time. Knowledge gained by interfacing with these socio-technical ecosystems enables the growth of the body of knowledge for MoT. This paper examines how MoT professionals need to adapt to build organizational and institutional mastery of emerging technologies. Design/Methodology/Approach The paper studies how digital transformation at organizational and industrial ecosystem levels is creating the world of the future. Scenario planning is used to develop four scenarios about future worlds. Designing a sustainable and desirable future requires Management of Technology experts to examine such scenarios as they provide the context for helping organizations and individuals envision how to meet the demands of the future. The scenarios are used to derive implications for the field of MoT. Findings The scenarios suggest that there may be differences across socio-technical ecosystems depending on differences in the use of digitalization - some future worlds may be at the technological frontier while others may lag. Implications for MoT professionals are also presented. Research limitations A limitation of the paper is that the impact of digital transformation is examined primarily through scenario planning and only four scenarios are presented. Practical implications The paper contributes insights on how to facilitate digital transformation that can help MoT experts and policy makers to prepare for the transformation arising from digital technologies. Originality/value of the paper The paper contributes to the MoT literature by delineating potential scenarios arising from the diffusion of digital technologies and applying literature on industrial ecosystems to the challenge of enabling socio-economic transformation. It highlights how MoT experts can facilitate digital transformation.",Surie G.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 30th International Conference of the International Association for Management of Technology, IAMOT 2021 - MOT for the World of the Future",2021-01-01,Adelphi University,Digital transformation ;  Industrial ecosystem adaptation ;  Management of technology ;  Scenario planning

THE ROLE OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING IN THE WATER-ENERGY-FOOD-WASTE NEXUS,"It has been estimated that the population will be 10 billion by the year 2050 with approximately two-thirds, 7 billion people, dwelling in urban areas. With the large increase in urban population density comes the associated increase in food, energy and water requirements as well as an elevated waste output. Innovative initiatives will need to be employed to improve global sustainability such as using advanced manufacturing which employs innovative technology for-instance autonomous robots, computational materials engineering and digital and additive manufacturing. This technology has already been successfully used to improve manufacturing processes, create novel materials, increase business agility and reduce waste and energy consumption during production. The aim of this study was to perform exploratory research to identify how advanced manufacturing technologies and the foundational mindset can be applied to improve the sustainability of the food-energy-water-waste nexus and promote innovation. Additive manufacturing could be used for renewable energy component repair, customized food printing and energy storage devices. The innovative mindset of advanced manufacturing can be applied to problems such as using maggots to reduce organic waste and CO2 and subsequently using them as a source of nutritional protein. To combat foreseen economic and social changes requires not only the implementation of advanced technological methods but also the willingness to embrace the agile and lean mindset on which the changes are based.",Davoren B.; Sacks N.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 30th International Conference of the International Association for Management of Technology, IAMOT 2021 - MOT for the World of the Future",2021-01-01,Stellenbosch University,Advanced manufacturing ;  Agile management ;  Lean manufacturing ;  Six sigma ;  Water-energy-food-waste
PROPOSAL OF A GOVERNANCE MODEL FOR RESEARCH CENTERS BASED ON STRUCTURE UNIVERSITY-COMPANY,"The importance of organizations originated through Science, Technology and Innovation programs in countries and regions, such as the Research and Development Centers have received increasing attention in the literature. However, there is a theoretical-empirical gap regarding the management models that can be implemented in the administration of these Research and Development Centers, especially in models that bear the assumptions of governance, environment and social in their design. Thus, the objective in this study was to propose a governance structure for Research and Development Centers for innovation and technology in the public-private relationship. A case study was used as a strategy, directed to the Engineering Research Center - Plant Health in Sugarcane of the School of Agrarian and Veterinarian Sciences at São Paulo State University, with the use of research- action like method. This technique, in line with management theories and models, business practices and sustainability criteria “Environmental, Social and Governance” supported the formulation of a governance model capable of contemplating the complexity of the Engineering Research Center investigated as an articulating organization in the university-company relationship.",Monteiro L.; Montoro S.; Santos D.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 30th International Conference of the International Association for Management of Technology, IAMOT 2021 - MOT for the World of the Future",2021-01-01,"Universidade Estadual Paulista ""Júlio de Mesquita Filho""",ESG sustainability ;  Innovation ;  Performance ;  R&D centers
UPSKILLING FOR DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION IN THE 4<sup>TH</sup> INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION: A SCOPING REVIEW,"The evolution of technology in the manufacturing industry has always been driven by increased production capacity, however, such advances are often accompanied by unanticipated social impact. Throughout the digital revolution in the mid-20th century job markets changed from labour intensive to capital intensive and workers without skills that fit this new paradigm were displaced and forced to upskill or reskill. Today we find ourselves on the brink of the 4th Industrial revolution - modern day society is more self-aware and has the means to avoid the pitfalls of prior technological transformations. That said, we also face a shrinking job market, staggering increases in the cost of higher education and a major shift in technology and human interaction due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Technology is developing at a faster pace than individuals can finish tertiary qualifications, exposing a crucial need for sustainable workforce development to keep up with the surge in technological innovations. In-service training has become a critical endeavour for both the private and public sectors to retain employees in the face of transformation. In this paper, a comprehensive scoping review is presented to assess the current state of in-service training initiatives within the manufacturing industry. Summarizing popular research themes and methodologies, and how interest in such initiatives have changed following the Covid-19 pandemic. The review was conducted according to the PRISMA scoping methodology: three boolean search strings were defined and each was screened over three databases (Scopus, Web of Science, and Engineering Compendex). 42 Studies were identified and assessed via qualitative categorization, and qualitative metrics. The studies were divided into 6 prominent research themes, nl: Learning factories, Gamification & Virtual Reality (VR), Internal company policy and Human resource development (HRD), government policy and economic incentive, High level evaluation of industry 4.0 readiness, and industry impact assessments. Additionally, the most prominent research methods employed throughout were interviews, surveys, literature reviews, case studies, new technology evaluations, and data analytics. The review concluded that though this research avenue is still emerging, it is growing fast. Multiple countries are already at the forefront of research in the sustainable adoption of the 4th industrial revolution into the manufacturing sector, and this review aims to summarize their efforts for ease of repeatability within future research.",van Coller M.; Grobbelaar S.; Sacks N.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 30th International Conference of the International Association for Management of Technology, IAMOT 2021 - MOT for the World of the Future",2021-01-01,Stellenbosch University,4  Industrial Revolution th ;  Digitization ;  Manufacturing ;  Upskilling
Effects of a Project Based Learning on the development of innovation competencies in online mode in first-year engineering students,"Developing innovation competencies is a current challenge in engineering education. Having the tools to initiate and carry out innovation projects is essential due to the dynamic, interconnected and complex nature of today's social challenges. The present research sought to evaluate the effects of the implementation of a teaching-learning strategy based on the Design Thinking methodology through i + e projects, in first-year engineering students. A pre and post-test design was used that used a standardized instrument to measure the change in the development of competence in innovation and questions aimed at evaluating self-efficacy and the probability of developing I + e projects. The results showed a favorable effect of the strategy on 4 of the 5 dimensions evaluated by the instrument, as well as on self-efficacy and the probability of developing the projects. The usefulness of the strategy for the purposes described and the limitation observed in the virtual context for the development of the experimental dimension due to its nature linked to the use of laboratories and direct experience is concluded.",Varas-Contreras M.; Maluenda-Albornoz J.; Chacano-Osses D.; Vidal-Valenzuela J.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - International Conference of the Chilean Computer Science Society, SCCC",2021-01-01,Universidad de Concepcion;Universidad San Sebastián,Active Learning ;  Design thinking ;  Engineering education ;  Higher Education ;  Project-based learning
OPTIMIZATION OF ALUMINUM OPTICAL TABLE PRODUCTION,"Machining of aluminum optical tables is a current topic due to its relevance to laboratory research in the field of laser technology, but also in the pharmaceutical or chemical industries. The purpose of this article is to present proposals to produce aluminum optical tables using modern machining methods focused on the production of holes and threads with qualitative aspects for the use of optical tables in vacuum atmosphere. Firstly, the main product, the machine and the original production method will be introduced. Subsequently, modern methods and tools for potential production improvement will be introduced. The third part deals with an experiment focused on the creation of threaded holes and their qualitative evaluation. The last part evaluates the economic aspect of production. To summarize the results, it is impossible to neglect the fact that innovations in cutting tools for aluminum alloys are a big step forward in mechanical engineering. The impact these tools have on production is very much needed, especially in industries such as the laser industry, where high demands are placed on quality, which is amplified by using optical tables in a vacuum. At the same time, they have a very positive effect on the economic aspect of production, which cannot be neglected while planning a production.",Cerveny J.; Povolny M.; Kroft L.,Conference Proceeding,Annals of DAAAM and Proceedings of the International DAAAM Symposium,2021-01-01,,Aluminum alloy ;  Drilling ;  Optical table ;  Threading
"DESIGN THE FUTURE ACTIVITIES (DFA): FRAMEWORK TO DEVELOP CASE STUDIES TO INCORPORATE DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE COUPLING BETWEEN TECHNOLOGY, SOCIETY AND THE FUTURE","Although engineering education research is concerned with preparing future engineers, the integration of future trends in technology with the engineering curriculum has been limited. This paper utilizes the Design the Future Activities (DFA) framework to provide guidelines for developing case studies in engineering design education to address the need for design for the future. The DFA as a framework systematically identifies and integrates emerging areas of research and technologies, such as artificial intelligence, into the teaching of engineering design. It links the contents of its three levels (Understanding technology analysis and system integration; Making a value chain, and Developing responsible innovations) with effective pedagogy for each level. Here, case studies are discussed in depth as an effective pedagogy for the second and third levels of the DFA framework. While engineers continue to be creators and influencers of such technologies, the lack of understanding of the impact of their own technologies continues to cause an imbalanced innovation landscape, in education and in the workplace. The new, revived design education approach should be attempted, assuming that educators will systematically anticipate the future and recalibrate the curriculum.",Ali H.,Conference Proceeding,"ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, Proceedings (IMECE)",2021-01-01,Arizona State University Polytechnic Campus,Case studies ;  Design for the future ;  Design the future activities ;  Engineering design education
VIRAL: The Effectiveness of Virtual Lab Teaching in Developing Higher Order Thinking Skills,"Virtual Innovation & Research Acceleration Lab (VIRAL) is an ongoing teaching pedagogy project between SRM Institute of Science & Technology, Ramapuram Campus, Chennai and MIT Square, London. In the higher education sector, the year 2020 posed new obstacles. All three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a shift in the mentality of educators, teachers, and students from all over the world. The concerns and obstacles associated with higher educational institutions' rapid and abrupt transition from face-to-face learning to technology-assisted virtual learning. This study examines the effectiveness of Virtual Innovation & Research Acceleration Labs (VIRAL) teaching in developing Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) among engineering students. The researchers employed a Quasi-Experimental method. The sample consisted of 98 Engineering students who have regular laboratory classes as part of their curriculum. A group consisting of 49 students was selected as a control group and another group was selected as an experimental group randomly. The result of the study indicates that the experimental group has a greater mean of higher-order thinking skills than the control group. Thus it is concluded that the virtual lab teaching method for research and innovation has a significant positive effect in enhancing higher thinking skills in engineering. The study also has implications for facilitation in the higher order of inquiry processes and improvement of slow learners.",Raja K.; Duela J.; Duraipandian K.; Rajan S.; Sathiyanarayanan M.,Conference Proceeding,"2021 1st Conference on Online Teaching for Mobile Education, OT4ME 2021",2021-01-01,SRM Institute of Science and Technology Ramapuram Campus;MIT Square,E-Learning ;  Higher Order Thinking Skills ;  ICT in Education ;  Teaching Pedagogies ;  Virtual Learning
"Lessons learned from FITech Turku, a 18 million euros university collaboration project to complement the regional demand for Master degree engineers","This Innovative Practice Full Paper presents a nationwide university collaboration project to complement regional demand for Master degree engineers. Technology industry with sufficient ability and investment in research, development and innovation is in the core of economic growth and success at both national and regional level. Higher education institutions should produce the needed new engineering professionals and serve as platforms for university-industry collaboration in research and innovation. Due to phenomena such as globalisation of industrial activities and growing demand for sustainable energy solutions, the regional development of different technology industry sectors, e.g. marine technology, telecommunications and battery technologies, can take diverting directions and change the need for skillsets of new engineers. While innovation activity of a local higher education institution can on long term provide the platform for new growth businesses, investment-heavy industries often have other drivers for the location of their activities. Establishing new degree programs, or even further, new educational institutions, contains its potential challenges, financial and in availability of qualified researchers, teachers and students. Furthermore, these efforts are not sufficiently fast to address the fairly rapid changes in the need for the workforce. FITech (Finnish Institute of Technology) has been a five year project to address the demand of qualified engineers in Southwestern Finland, the region with the fastest growing technology industry in the country. The project consortium contains the seven Finnish universities providing engineering education, with the budget for the 5-year project period (from 2017 to 2021) being 18 million euros, from which 70% is funded by the Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture, and the 30% is covered by the universities themselves, This paper analyzes the quantitative (e.g. master thesis elaborated in companies in the region, plans and agreements to take the collaboration forward after the funded project period) of the project. In addition to reflect upon the follow up, three new education projects (FITech ICT, FITech Energy Storage and FITech 5G), materialized from the collaboration within FITech consortium, are introduced. The discussion summarizes the detected challenges and areas for improvement to enhance the success of such systematic university collaboration at a national scale.",Vasankari T.; Vahala L.; Sedano C.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2021-01-01,Aalto University;Turun yliopisto,academy-industry collaboration ;  engineering education ;  FITech ;  university network
The development and validation of a framework for teaching software engineering through startup practice in higher education,"Context: Approaches to teaching software engineering are becoming more interdisciplinary and team-centered, similar to a startup practice context. Therefore, educators must have an adequate framework for supporting software engineering teaching through startup practice. However, only a meager set of existing frameworks introduce startup practice to teach software engineering. Aim: Our study aims to develop and validate a framework for teaching software engineering through startup practice in higher education. Method: We developed a framework for introducing startup practices in software engineering education. We first identified the framework domains (course teaching and design perspectives, course theoretical lens, and course design and interaction practices) based on a previous literature review pinpointing lean software startups as part of software engineering education research. We further identified dimensions for each domain based on investigations in both our software engineering experience-based course and growth phase startup context. Finally, we validated the framework using a Delphi method. Results: We found that the perception of the framework dimensions was positive among the experts who, on average, rated 14 out of 19 dimensions as highly important (approximately 75%) and the rest (25%) as of average importance. From the current results, we are able to deduce that our proposed framework can provide realistic learning expectations for SE students but also for other disciplines that can relate to software engineering. Contribution: The study's outcomes contribute to developing and validating a framework for teaching software engineering through startup practice in higher education. Our framework lays a foundation for educators and researchers by successfully combining experience-based software engineering courses with lean software startup industry practices. Furthermore, our framework contributes to students acquiring adequate professional skills to address societal challenges with a mindset focused on increased innovation and startup formation.",Cico O.; Duc A.; Jaccheri L.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2021-01-01,University of South-Eastern Norway;Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,framework ;  software engineering education ;  startup practice
Adoption of Pedagogical Innovations: Resource Networks of Engineering Education Guilds,"This Full Research paper uses resource network analysis to explore what resources faculty use when they make changes to their pedagogy, and how an engineering education 'guild' is situated among those resources. The process of influencing pedagogical change can be understood as lying along a spectrum. On one end of the spectrum is the dissemination model, where research is simply made available and instructors are expected to seek out new tools. On the other end is the propagation model, where researchers, developers, and instructors work as one cohesive team to get innovative tools into classrooms. While each of these models and the instructor resources associated with them have been separately studied and defined, approaches on the spectrum between them remain understudied. Engineering education guilds employ an approach that falls along the dissemination-propagation spectrum; they use both dissemination and propagation techniques to influence pedagogical changes. Despite lack of formal research on the subject, engineering education 'guilds' have become an increasingly popular vehicle for pedagogical change in engineering education classrooms. One such engineering education guild is the Kern Entrepreneurial Engineering Network (KEEN), which is focused on integrating entrepreneurial mindset (EM) into engineering curricula. By constructing resource networks for educators who have been exposed to KEEN, we aim to understand the role of KEEN among the myriad resources used by engineering educators when they integrate EM-related content into their classrooms. Results suggest that engineering education guilds are central to the resource networks of faculty looking to innovate their pedagogy, with the most popular resources all falling under the guild's umbrella. These resources are also strongly interconnected, especially during the integration process. However, the resources networks of those who saw successful, complete, sustained adoption reached beyond the guild's umbrella, forging connections with a variety of other materials from different sources.",Riley D.; Mallouk K.; Strong A.; Faber C.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2021-01-01,Henry M.

Design the Future Activities (DFA): Typology of Content for Case Studies,"This work-in-progress, research-to-practice provides a typology for content for case studies that are developed as part of the Design the Future Activities (DF A) framework. This work is based on the understanding that the nature of engineering design education and practice is changing due to the emergence of intelligent, autonomous objects. Traditional ways of teaching design, which are based on teaching design as a process of creatively solving problems, are not sufficient. Complementary to previous teaching practices is the need to provide design content to address the need for designing for the future, where intelligent objects act as a stakeholder in the design problem. In this paper, a typology of content is proposed to develop case studies that address the need for developing and delivering the DFA framework; that is engineering design education with the core of the technology of artificial intelligence.",Ali H.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2021-01-01,Arizona State University Polytechnic Campus,AI case studies ;  creating responsible innovations ;  Design for the future ;  making a value chain ;  technology analysis
Fostering Digital Literacy through Active Learning in Engineering Education,"This Research-to-Practice Full Paper discusses the use of the active learning approach to enhance the 21st century skills that are critical to developing new job opportunities for young engineers. The soft skills required in the Fourth Industrial Revolution make the traditional mode of logical-scientific thinking insufficient for the degree of innovation and disruption required in future jobs. In the field of higher engineering education, the situation was doubly challenging: Generation Z students' cognitive skills had to be improved in terms of digital literacy and cutting-edge technological tools had to be quickly incorporated. This work is a study on the effectiveness of the didactic approach of Active Learning in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics) and the innovative ways of empowering students to develop digital literacy skills, among them: photo-visual ability, reproduction ability, branching ability, real-time critical thinking ability and, the most important of this study, socio-emotional ability. The opportunities and challenges that the study addressed were related to accessibility, inclusion, and self-paced learning. The research was carried out with a mixed experimental methodology in a sample of 352 engineering students, who were evaluated with different types of instruments to know the level of acquisition of soft skills related to digital literacy. To evaluate these skills, different assessing instruments were used for pre-tests and post-tests, including: vocabulary level, lateral thinking ability, fluency and originality; as well as story-articulation skill tests and modified VALUE rubrics from the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AACU). The results obtained showed that the active learning approach promoted a better understanding of scientific concepts in engineering subjects, a greater ability to develop digital communication skills, and a greater awareness of creative thinking skill.",Caratozzolo P.; Alvarez-Delgado A.; Sirkis G.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2021-01-01,Universidad del CEMA;Tecnológico de Monterrey,Education 4.0 ;  Educational innovation ;  higher education ;  soft skills in engineering ;  STEAM
Science and technology fields and higher education institutions with mathematically trained contributors: Metadata analysis of IEEE papers,"Recently, the shortage of mathematically trained individuals who can integrate mathematical knowledge and skills with other types of knowledge and skills and thereby contribute to innovation has become apparent. To find clues for solving this problem, we identify scientific and technology fields (STFs) that require mathematically trained contributors and identify higher education institutions (HEIs) that provide students an opportunity to develop the mathematical knowledge needed in the STFs. We perform this by analyzing a large amount of metadata of papers in IEEE journals, which is easily accessible via the Scopus API. The metadata contains author's affiliation information, which is useful for identifying HEIs with a mathematical faculty. For example, if an author's affiliation information contains terms related to mathematics such as 'Department of Mathematics' or 'Dept. of Math.,' the author can be considered to have had advanced mathematical training. We demonstrate that 1) the contributions of mathematically trained individuals to research fields covered by published IEEE papers have continued to increase, 2) their contributions are particularly important to micro-STFs such as information theory, reliability, fuzzy systems, and neural networks, and 3) the degree of their contributions to the various STF-focused journals differs between HEIs.",Ikegawa T.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2021-01-01,The University of Tokyo,higher education institution ;  IEEE papers ;  mathematical training ;  scientific and technology field ;  Scopus API ;  Survey data collection
Creation of a Framework that Integrates Technical Innovation and Learning in Engineering,"This full research paper presents the development of the Innovation-Based Learning (IBL) Framework, the first framework to integrate innovation and learning within engineering classrooms. Engineering programs across the world are looking for ways to develop innovative engineering students. Work has been done in engineering education to develop qualitative frameworks and best practices for teaching, but these frameworks and practices do not align with many of the complexities of teaching innovation. Both the engineering education and research community could benefit from the creation of a framework that integrates technical innovation and learning in engineering because it would help drive development of best practices in teaching engineering innovation and lead to stronger research in this area. This work details the development of such a framework by using data from an Innovation-Based Learning course and the alternate templates strategy. The framework is simple enough that it includes only seven categories, generalizable enough that it can fit multiple students from multiple groups working on multiple projects, and accurate enough that there is sufficient interrater reliability. The final product is a framework that focuses on the divergent and convergent behaviors of innovation and learning. The IBL Framework has implications for both instructors teaching innovation and researchers studying innovation in educational settings. The framework gives instructors and students a unifying vocabulary about the process of learning innovation, and it allows researchers to sort student actions into illustrative categories. Ultimately, the framework can lead to unifying best practices when teaching and researching innovation in classroom settings.",Singelmann L.; Striker R.; Vazquez E.; Swartz E.; Pearson M.; Ng S.; Ewert D.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2021-01-01,NDSU College of Engineering;Biola University,experiential learning ;  innovation ;  qualitative frameworks
Understanding How Family Influences and Support Students' Certainty of Engineering Major,"This research paper explores how students' motivation from family influences and family recognition may provide particular support for students' certainty of an engineering major. This outcome has been linked to higher retention rates in engineering and is a useful way to understand students' pathways early on in their undergraduate careers. Family has a significant role in shaping a student and developing their values, skills, and socialization. For example, a family of engineers may emphasize math and physics, while a family of authors may emphasize creative writing and reading. Furthermore, in the United States, socioeconomic status is a major determiner in students' opportunities to engage in STEM outside of formal education and the types of careers with which families may be familiar. Prior studies indicate that talking about science at home is a particularly important predictor of students' STEM interests. Additionally, first-generation college students and students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may have higher family pressure to choose engineering as a track for upward mobility. However, much of the prior work examining familial influences on STEM or engineering students' career pathways has focused on K-12 or students' decisions about engineering as a major in college. In contrast, this study explores the role of family on students' career pathways during college through a variety of related constructs and answers the research question, 'What family and background factors predict undergraduate engineering students' surety of major?' In this work, we draw on Yosso's framework of Community Cultural Wealth to understand how familial capital can support student pathways through engineering. Familial capital refers to those cultural knowledges nurtured among family or kin that support a sense of community history, memory, and cultural intuition. The data for this study comes from a larger mixed-methods project focused on characterizing latent diversity in engineering. A national survey of 3,711 students from 32 ABET-accredited first-year engineering programs measured over a dozen underlying attitudes, beliefs, and mindsets including epistemic beliefs, motivation, innovation self-efficacy beliefs, personality, STEM role identity, and demographics. We used multiple linear regression to predict engineering students' surety of major as influenced by their motivation (i.e., controlled or autonomous), reported family recognition of them as engineers, and demographics characteristics. Additionally, we included whether students had family members, particularly parents with STEM degrees to understand how knowledge of STEM careers might support students' pathways. The results of this work provide insights into how a family may function as particular supports for students even from afar in a university setting.",Perkins H.; Benedict B.; Rohde J.; Godwin A.; Washington M.; Castillo A.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2021-01-01,"College of Engineering;University of California, Irvine",diversity ;  persistence ;  recruitment
Women in STEM: How can we understand and support their career development?,"This Research Full Paper investigates the rich stories of a range of women in STEM through psychological and sociological frames to develop a career development framework. Current research acknowledges the lack of representation of women in STEM and reports on challenges and barriers to recruiting, retaining, and advancing women in these fields. Engineering educators recognise the need for the profession to diversify, to be more inclusive, and that innovation and entrepreneurial mindsets are required for engineering leaders in the future. Traditional career ladders are dissolving and we understand better the new models of boundaryless and protean (self-directed and values-driven) careers that span across work units, organisations and sectors, including self-employment. The future of engineering education requires learning designers to better understand how to develop the mindsets required for orienteering the many transitions in the careers of the future. If we are to support the careers of women in STEM we need to understand the nature of their career paths and choices. This qualitative research used semi-structured interviews to explore the career narratives of women in STEM, focusing on the career decision making and individual perceptions of career choices associated with career shifts or pivots. With reference to the literature on career choice, mindsets and motivations, an inductive and thematic analysis was conducted and descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data. We looked at the career paths of women in STEM in terms of their career patterns, locus of control, career context, career age and stage, career sponsorship, and their experiences in entrepreneurial ventures. A framework has been developed for characterising and understanding women's choices and the mindsets that enable success. This framework will enable us to identify approaches and tools that are useful for women to evaluate their own mindsets and design their career choices. The results can be used to inform the design of resources and interventions that support the retainment and advancement of women in STEM, developing an intentional change mindset, and supporting career choices from undergraduate level to continuous professional development education. This new framework for career development is emerging and integrates knowledge from educational research and professional experience of women to enable educators, coaches, people managers, and human resource professionals to better prepare women and organisations for the future of work.",Childers J.; MacHet T.; Duval M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2021-01-01,University of Technology Sydney;Fingerprint for Success,career choice ;  mindsets ;  women
How to Measure the Innovativeness and Entrepreneurship Features of a Curriculum?,"This Research-to-Practice, Work in Progress paper attempts to provide a quantitative method to measure the innovativeness and entrepreneurship feature of a curriculum through available assessment data. This paper builds on our previous works relating systems thinking and design methodology to innovation and entrepreneurship. In this work, we propose an approach based on using the ABET's assessment process to obtain a measure for the innovativeness and entrepreneurship of the curriculum. We have used the engineering innovator characteristics as the base for our calculation. The proposed scheme also reveals the usefulness of the combined student outcomes assessment data. Given the nature of the collected data, it cannot be used as a wayof comparing with other programs, and it is only a self-assessment indicator.",Azemi A.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2021-01-01,University of Wisconsin-Platteville,ABET ;  Assessment ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Innovation

Health and Safety Innovations to Reduce the Spread of Contagious Disease,"In this paper, we report on a series of design innovation projects conducted by student teams at the University of Colorado at Denver in collaboration with research scientists at the US Air Force Research Lab. The COVID-19 pandemic has made apparent the risks of disease transmission through multiple vectors in public spaces that could potentially benefit from further protection and safety measures. Utilizing formal ideation and innovation methods from the 4D Design Innovation (DI) process, the teams studied what specific problems to solve, explored potential solution ideas, and developed some early-concept prototypes for feasibility demonstration. Design Innovation (DI) provides both an overall process for product design and also methods for each step in the process. This paper details the correlation between the steps in the DI process and the results produced by the teams. The teams primarily focused on minimizing the risk of disease transmission through reducing the physical touching of common public items; additional solutions relating to contact tracing and social distancing were also explored. Initial functional prototypes were developed and demonstrated for: (a) touchless elevator control systems using voice commands, foot pedals, gestures, and touchless buttons; (b) an automated desk usage hygienic management system; (c) an automated remote video person tracker for monitoring compliance with indoor social distancing and room capacity limits; and (d) a contact tracing app. We discuss the prototyped solutions in detail, and describe promising ways forward for developing these technologies, with the aims of combatting the spread of disease and ensuring overall public health, safety, and security.",McIntire J.; Harlow F.; May E.; Wilson C.; Jensen D.,Conference Proceeding,"2021 IEEE Virtual IEEE International Symposium on Technologies for Homeland Security, HST 2021",2021-01-01,Air Force Research Laboratory,"contact tracing ;  contact transmission mitigation ;  design innovation ;  design thinking ;  fomite transmission ;  health ;  hygiene ;  no contact technology, no touch devices ;  proximity tracing ;  safety ;  touchless interaction"

A Robotics-based Learning Environment Supporting Computational Thinking Skills - Design and Development,"This Research to Practice Full Paper presents the development of a robotics-based learning environment using an educational design research approach. Contemporary teaching should prepare learners for everyday and working life, suggesting that this can only be achieved by implementing Digital Education from primary education onwards. Since computer science education is planned to be anchored in the Austrian primary school curriculum as an interdisciplinary competence development, research into teaching methods and content suitable for this area is becoming increasingly necessary. In this context, the transfer of innovations and didactic approaches into teaching is one of the biggest challenges. Introducing coding and robotics would be a possible strategy. Educational robotics provide access to real-world scenarios and offer age-appropriate possibilities to explore digital aspects of living and working environments. Combined with narrative methods, such as digital storytelling, problem-solving skills could be developed. Since the implementation of computer science in primary education requires practical and theoretical knowledge, an educational design approach is used that takes this aspect into account and allows close interaction between researchers and practitioners. This paper focuses on investigating a feasible and effective robotics-based learning environment for developing and supporting problem-solving skills at primary school using the learning and teaching method digital storytelling. Hence, the development of the learning environment and the didactic approach gained from qualitative results of interviews and observations from the first cycle of the research project are presented, providing plausible arguments for further implementing this robotics-based learning environment.",Tengler K.; Kastner-Hauler O.; Sabitzer B.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2021-01-01,Johannes Kepler University Linz;University College of Teacher Education Lower Austria,computational thinking ;  digital storytelling ;  educational robotics ;  primary school

Defining and delivering 'equity' in an RPP,"Computer science (CS) has the potential to positively impact the economic well-being of those who pursue it, and the lives of those who benefit from its innovations. Yet, large CS learning opportunity gaps exist for students from historically underrepresented populations. The Computer Science for All (CS for All) movement has brought nationwide attention to these inequities in CS education. More recently, financial support for research-practice partnerships (RPPs) has increased to address these disparities because such collaborations can yield more relevant research for immediate educational/practical application. However, for initiatives to effectively engage in equity-focused initiatives toward making computing inclusive, partnership members need to begin with a shared definition of equity to which all are accountable. This poster takes a critical look at the development of a collaboratively developed definition of equity and its application in a CS for All RPP of university researchers and administrators from local education agencies across the state of California. Details are shared about how the RPP collectively defined equity and how that definition evolved and informed the larger project's work with school administrators/educators.",Hadad R.; Ryoo J.; Flapan J.; Kong S.,Conference Proceeding,"2021 Research on Equity and Sustained Participation in Engineering, Computing, and Technology, RESPECT 2021 - Conference Proceedings",2021-01-01,"University of California, Los Angeles;Riverside Unified School District",administration ;  community building ;  computer science education ;  equity ;  leadership ;  RPP

Wood City: Timberizing the City’s Building Blocks,"“Wood City” applies mass timber engineering to the 19 building categories that essentially shape our built environments, otherwise financialized as real estate products by Wall Street. Suburban offices, fast-food restaurants, metal warehouses, big-box grocers, garden apartments, single-family houses, hotels, self-storage facilities, assisted living facilities, strip-shopping centers, etc. constitute 75% of the built environment. Given that the US will double its built environment in just one generation coupled with the urgency to develop low-carbon futures, what if cities were built from the only construction system sequestering carbon and engineered to be “energy positive” – wood? Real estate value chains are undergoing transformations in sectors like fuel retail, fast food, grocery, and logistics, while new interest from venture-capital is hybridizing housing, hospitality, healthcare, and the senior services markets.

Determinants of high-tech export in cee and cis countries,"Any government strives to stimulate export activity in high-tech sectors of its economy. Surprisingly, there are few empirical papers on the determinants of high-tech export to date. This study analyses the economies of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) due to the differences they experienced in the transition period. To this end, we used the Balassa index, which is based on the concept of revealed comparative advantages. The research examines 73 groups of products from the automotive, chemical, mechanical engineering, electronics and electrical engineering industries in 27 countries from 1995 to 2018. Principal component analysis helped generate an indicator of comparative advantage of hightech industries for each country in each year. It is revealed that CEE countries, as well as the Baltic countries, have achieved significant success in the development of high-tech sectors of the economy, while the CIS countries have shown practically no progress in this direction. The article tests hypotheses on the impact of resources, foreign trade, macroeconomy and innovation on export activity in the country. The following factors stimulate the export growth in high-tech industries of the studied countries: Level of wages and resource prices, openness of the economy to foreign trade; tax rate; unemployment rate; quality of human capital. We did not find empirical evidence of the positive impact of inflation, inflows of direct foreign investment, and the level of research and development (R&D) costs on the volume of high-tech export of the examined economies.",Drapkin I.; Gainetdinova A.; Panzabekova A.,Journal,Economy of Regions,2021-01-01,Ural Federal University;Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan,Balassa index ;  Competitiveness of industries ;  Determinants of growth in high-tech industries ;  Export ;  Export stimulation ;  Export structure by industry ;  High-tech industries ;  Post-communist economies ;  Revealed comparative advantage ;  Structural problems in the Russian economy

Towards a Communication Engineering to Think about the Co-Construction of Public Action?,"This article aims to lay out a scientific approach about the public policies processes of co-construction from the standpoint of communication sciences. To that end, we report the result of an action-research and an ethnographic survey within a French territorial collectivity. This study analyzes a social economy and social innovation policy in order to democratize public policies. This paper argues that communication must be understood not from an inter-understanding perspective but, on the contrary, through an incommunication approach. Consequently, the co-construction processes of public policies are subject to these phenomena of incommunication and require a communicational intervention from a mediator: their role is to build a shared perspective between actors with very peculiar socio-cultural backgrounds.",Volat G.,Journal,Communiquer,2021-01-01,Université Clermont Auvergne,Ethnography ;  Incommunication ;  Mediation ;  Participatory democracy ;  Social innovation
Allocation of scientific and technological resources in scientific research institutes: Current situation analysis and enlightenment:-Thinking based on the progress of engineering technology,"The reserve and promotion of engineering technology can not be separated from continuous research and development, so as to achieve technical research. Scientific research institutes are the national army in China's innovation system, and are an important force to promote the development of China's engineering technology and help industry innovation. Optimizing the allocation structure of scientific and technological resources in scientific research institutes is helpful to the research and development of engineering technology. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously optimize the allocation structure of scientific and technological resources of research institutes to enhance their innovation ability, so as to spill knowledge or technology into various industries and promote the progress of engineering technology. Based on the data from 2009 to 2018, this paper analyzes the overall situation of scientific and technological resources in research institutes, and makes a comparative analysis of the input-output structure of scientific and technological resources in research institutes of different industries from horizontal and vertical perspectives. The results show that the investment of scientific and technological resources has greatly increased, and with the change of scientific and technological strategy, the allocation structure in research institutes of different industries has also changed greatly. However, the investment in basic research resources is still insufficient, and the proportion of scientific and technological investment in manufacturing research institutes in three types of RD activities is seriously unbalanced.",Yuanyuan F.; Yu S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2021 International Conference on Management Science and Software Engineering, ICMSSE 2021",2021-01-01,Zhejiang Gongshang University,engineering technology ;  resource allocation structure ;  scientific and technological resources

Therefore, this paper makes an empirical study by establishing the theoretical model of differential leadership, role load and employee innovation behavior. Using SPSS22.0 and AMOS24.0 software, the correlation analysis and hierarchical regression analysis of variables were carried out to verify whether the hypothesis and model were valid. The results show that the differential leadership has a negative influence on the employee's innovation behavior, and the employees in the circle will have a large role load and then affect the innovation behavior. Based on the above research results, it can be seen that the leadership style has a great influence on the innovation behavior of the core personnel of engineering and technology, and the enterprise managers can formulate a series of countermeasures and suggestions to enhance the innovation of employees according to the influence relationship of the leadership mode on the role load and the employee's innovation behavior.",Wu M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2021 International Conference on Management Science and Software Engineering, ICMSSE 2021",2021-01-01,Guizhou University of Finance and Economics,Differential Leadership ;  Employee innovation behavior ;  Engineering and technical personnel ;  Role load

Similarly, information technology such as virtual simulation is also widely used in the field of innovation and entrepreneurship education (IEE) in higher education. Virtual simulation experimental teaching platform is an important informatization teaching tool. Its use of intelligence and simulation technology to simulate the innovation and entrepreneurship practice environment provides information technology resources and platform for practical teaching of IEE. Based on the systematic summary of the factors affecting the quality of IEE, this paper illustrates the role of the virtual simulation experimental teaching platform in building a new teaching mode of IEE, including its application in the IEE in the professional disciplines of economics and management, communication technology and pharmacy. Finally, it is concluded that the construction of information-based teaching platform and other internal and external factors of universities affect the quality of IEE. The influencing factors at the internal level of colleges and universities are better studied, while the scope of application of information technology and teaching effectiveness as well as factors external to colleges and universities need more empirical support.

Technology for designing innovative processes for creating products and services of a network enterprise using an i4.0 knowledge-based system,"The creation of network enterprises based on the digital technologies of the Industrie 4.0 (the 4th Industrial Revolution, i4.0) opens broad opportunities for increasing production flexibility, customer focus and continuous innovation in products and services provided. At the same time, new opportunities necessitate the development of new methods and technologies for designing innovative processes in the context of digital i4.0 platforms, all of which highlights the relevance of the presented research topic. This work aims to define technologies for designing innovative processes to create products and services using i4.0 systems which are based on multi-agent interaction of asset administration shells (AAS), displaying digital twins of product components, and the use of ontological and cognitive methods for forming and justifying design decisions. The work presented here uses the Domain-Driven Design approach, an architectural framework for building i4.0 systems, methods of ontological engineering, quality function deployment (QFD), analysis of the types and consequences of potential inconsistencies (FMEA) and processing of fuzzy sets. The paper proposes principles for identifying bounded contexts of the domain under the design activities for the stages of the life cycle and products' subsystems (components). For bounded contexts of the domain, it is envisaged to create AAS of i4.0 systems, with the help of which the innovative process is supported and the multi-agent interaction of its participants is carried out. As cognitive tools for making design decisions, we proposed to use services for assessing the importance of the determined quality characteristics of products and minimizing deviations of the proposed solutions from the formed functional and non-functional requirements. The methods of ontological engineering and data modelling allow us to dynamically develop an innovative project and support various versions of the project in the design process. Application of the proposed technology for designing innovative processes to create products and services at network enterprises using i4.0 systems will improve the quality of design decisions, increase the dynamism and continuous design of innovative projects.",Telnov Y.; Kazakov V.; Danilov A.,Journal,Business Informatics,2021-01-01,Plekhanov Russian University of Economics,Asset administration shell (AAS) ;  Bounded context ;  Digital twin ;  Domain-driven design ;  I4.0 platform ;  I4.0 system ;  Innovative process ;  Multi-agent interaction ;  Ontology ;  Value-added chain
DEVELOPMENT OF ONLINE LEARNING PRACTICES IN A JAPANESE UNIVERSITY BASED ON THE QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEYS,"This study aims to clarify the development of online learning practice of engineering education in a Japanese university under the pandemic of the COVID-19. The research question is how online learning, especially blended learning, was practiced. By 2020, advances in Internet technology and its widespread use had already formed the basis for online classes. However, face-to-face classes were the mainstream, and there were few online classes for undergraduate education. We will present the development of online learning at a Japanese university, which is a private technical university in the bay area of Tokyo, Japan, as an example. This university had conducted all classes online in the first semester of 2020. The transition to online classes was unexpected, and classes started in May, a month late. In the second semester, some classes were face-to-face, while many classes were online. We will present: 1. how progressed the teaching style to blended learning, 2. how changed the students’ understanding of classes, 3. how changed the students’ satisfaction level of classes. The significant difference is that blended learning started in the second semester. The understanding and satisfaction of the students have improved in the second semester. The background of this development is also that the faculty, administrators, and students collaborated to work on education innovation.",Aihara S.; Suzuki H.; Tsunoda K.; Hoshi Y.; Inoue M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - SEFI 49th Annual Conference: Blended Learning in Engineering Education: Challenging, Enlightening - and Lasting?",2021-01-01,Shibaura Institute of Technology,COVID-19 ;  Faculty survey ;  Online/blended learning ;  Student survey
INTEGRATED CLASSROOM LEARNING: HOW TO CREATE AN ACTIVATING AND SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR ONLINE LEARNING IN KNOWLEDGE EXCHANGE AND INNOVATION EDUCATION FOR ENGINEERING STUDENTS,"The Covid-19 pandemic posed significant challenges for educators in higher education institutions to develop and implement online teaching formats at very short notice. Those challenges were felt especially in small courses such as tutorials or seminars that strongly rely on the close interaction and lively discussions among participants. In small courses students effectively develop future-oriented competencies. In order to foster learning, educators need to create an environment in which students can acquire the necessary knowledge exchange skills, innovation methods, and an entrepreneurial mindset. That requires new approaches to online teaching/learning. Educators need to use interactive learning formats to achieve those learning outcomes, yet they often lack the relevant tools or guidance. Drawing on the experience of the past three ‘creative semesters’ (State Secretary for Science and Research in Berlin Krach), my paper develops four steps that educators can take to establish digital classrooms as safer spaces for students and teaching staff alike. The concept of safer spaces (Schutzraum) originated from gender-aware youth work in the 1970s. I adapt this concept to higher education didactics to address challenges for online teaching/learning by creating an activating and encouraging learning environment. Safer spaces can provide a framework in which students and educators interact openly. As the result of mutual respect and trust, the online classroom environment becomes a key factor in fostering deep learning.",Johannsen T.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - SEFI 49th Annual Conference: Blended Learning in Engineering Education: Challenging, Enlightening - and Lasting?",2021-01-01,Technische Universität Berlin,Activating teaching and learning ;  Blended learning ;  Covid-19 ;  Integrated classroom learning ;  Knowledge exchange training ;  Online learning ;  Pandemic ;  Pedagogy ;  Safer space ;  Transfer skills
TOMORROW'S CHALLENGES FOR TODAY'S STUDENTS: CHALLENGE-BASED LEARNING AND INTERDISCIPLINARITY,"TU/e innovation Space offers an environment for students to work in interdisciplinary teams on societal problems. These problems ask for development of a shared language for interdisciplinary collaboration and to facilitate learning processes. Little is known about design characteristics for these problems, and what is needed to support interdisciplinarity in student teams. The educational concept Challenge-based learning (CBL) uses authentic societal problems ('challenges') to urge student learning. The main research question for this case study is: What design characteristics of innovation Space challenges support interdisciplinary student collaboration? Data collection consisted of analysis of learning materials, interviews with teachers and students, student surveys about motivation and collaborative learning in four courses and two honour’s tracks. The results show how teachers ask for competence development in supporting students, especially in assessing and integrating discipline knowledge. Students reported high motivation combined with anxiety for open and complex challenges. Over time this anxiety decreases, as students develop knowledge to solve the challenge. Students also reported a need for a clear mapping of learning goals to activities and assessment. For students it appeared often unclear how and on what criteria they are assessed. Yet, students also reported support in developing ownership, self-directed learning, and collaborative learning. This study confirms existing literature that emphasises difficulties in students developing rigorous discipline knowledge in CBL and interdisciplinary assessment. This study increases our understanding of challenge design and how interdisciplinarity can be situated in this design. It offers starting points for research on motivation and collaborative learning in CBL.",van den Beemt A.; MacLeod M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - SEFI 49th Annual Conference: Blended Learning in Engineering Education: Challenging, Enlightening - and Lasting?",2021-01-01,Technische Universiteit Eindhoven;Universiteit Twente,
ANALYSIS OF THE EVOLUTION OF A STEAM LECTURER-TRAINING PROGRAM BASED ON COMPETENCIES IN AN HYBRID CONTEXT,"The objective of this work is to present an innovative lecturer’s training program developed at UPC-BarcelonaTech while transitioning to a semi-presential hybrid scenario due to the pandemic. This “Postgraduate Degree in University Teaching in STEAM” was designed based on the teaching competencies that a lecturer should possess in Engineering-related subjects. Focus was placed on a final project to help lecturers implement innovations in class with their students. When the confinement due to the pandemic started, it was evident that many lecturers had a clear deficit on digital competencies to conduct their teaching on-line. This paper presents an analysis on the changes undertaken in the program after a year of hybrid teaching, their impact on the teachers and on the participants of the program. A more flexible syllabus, the addition of digital education courses for lecturers, and a more research-oriented program are important factors that have improved the quality of the program. Results show that participation in the courses offered during this exceptional period radically increased for some areas such as digital on-line technologies for education, while the egressed number of participants did not change significantly from previous editions. Specific recommendations are provided for Engineering Education programs, as the perception of the importance of some of these competences by the instructors are found to be significantly different among different STEAM fields of knowledge. Valuable lessons have been learned in this process, with some of the changes undertaken having a good prospect to stay in the near future.",Perez-Poch A.; Alcober J.; Alier M.; d’Arc Prat J.; Llorens A.; López D.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - SEFI 49th Annual Conference: Blended Learning in Engineering Education: Challenging, Enlightening - and Lasting?",2021-01-01,Universitat Politécnica de Catalunya,Digital education ;  Soft skills ;  STEAM education ;  Teacher training
DEFINING INTENDED LEARNING OUTCOMES (ILO’S) OF INTER-PROGRAM CBL TOWARDS ACHIEVING CONSTRUCTIVE ALIGNMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF ISBEP,"We present a framework that connects identified competence areas with Indented Learning Outcomes (ILO’s). Such a framework is likely to be useful for the design of inter-program Challenge-Based Learning (CBL) in engineering education. The framework was developed out of a need to increase the constructive alignment (CA) of ILO's, learning/teaching activities, and assessment of the Innovation Space Bachelor End Project (ISBEP); an inter-program CBL initiative at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). The framework was developed based on a co-creation session, and set up around the definition of ILO’s as departing point to reach CA. We contribute a comprehensive framework listing the ILO’s associated with inter-program CBL at the third-year, bachelor level, and identify three categories related to design and research processes, professional skills, and professional identity and self-directed learning. Furthermore, we illustrate our findings with practices from ISBEP, highlighting the influence of ILO’s on our efforts to reach alignment. Finally, we discuss the implications for CBL design, propose future work, and draw attention to possible limitations in the use of the framework.",Valencia A.; Bruns M.; Reymen I.; Ruijten P.; Pepin B.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - SEFI 49th Annual Conference: Blended Learning in Engineering Education: Challenging, Enlightening - and Lasting?",2021-01-01,Technische Universiteit Eindhoven,Challenge Based Learning ;  Constructive Alignment ;  Inter-Program Education ;  Interdisciplinary Education
VARIETY IN CHALLENGE-BASED LEARNING IN HIGHER EDUCATION,"Increasingly higher education programs are made open and flexible to face challenges demanded by societal changes. Challenge-based learning (CBL) is perceived as an educational concept shaping these open and flexible programs. However, CBL as a field of research is still in its infancy. The present study searches for all-embracing commonalities of CBL in engineering education. We propose an evaluative framework that both includes commonalities and allows for variety in CBL characteristics between study components. This framework, labelled CBL-compass, serves as a methodological approach for educational staff and researchers to visualise the local colour of CBL in higher education institutions. With this study we aim to advance the field by contributing to a conceptual basis in flexibility in CBL. Our research question was: How can we assess the variety of CBL implementations in engineering education experiments? This question was answered by an evaluative case study. First, existing literature on CBL was scoped. The characteristics following from this review were perceived as dimensions, each with associated indicators. Empirical data were collected from an evaluation of six CBL experiments. The variety of scores on the CBL-compass gave an impression of how teachers implemented CBL in their course or project and can thus be used as an evaluation mechanism to improve this implementation. Filling in the CBL-compass triggered reflection among teachers about their course and CBL. The added value of the CBL-compass is the attention for, amongst others assessment or teacher skills and support, which are important for the overall quality of study components.",van den Beemt A.; van den Watering G.; Bots M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - SEFI 49th Annual Conference: Blended Learning in Engineering Education: Challenging, Enlightening - and Lasting?",2021-01-01,Technische Universiteit Eindhoven,Challenge-based learning ;  Educational innovation ;  Evaluative case study ;  Higher education
IDENTIFYING INDUSTRY NEEDS FOR INNOVATION SKILLS IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION: A THEMATIC ANALYSIS OF CASES FROM DANISH INDUSTRY,"Providing students with knowledge, skills, and competencies in innovation has become a central focus in engineering education. However, there is limited knowledge on which innovation skills need to be supported and how well engineering education meets current knowledge gaps in the industry. As a first step towards addressing this research question, our paper presents findings from examining 49 innovation cases provided by Danish industries for the Applied Innovation in Engineering (AIE) course at Aarhus University.

Low-Cost System Architecture Solutions for Small Unmanned Aircraft Traffic Management,"As commercial and hobbyist interest in small, unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) grows, traffic density in our low-altitude airspace is rapidly increasing. With many of these vehicles providing the human operator knowledge of their location through line-of-sight observation, often without integrated collision avoidance technology, sUAS are presenting an increasing concern for the safety and security of individuals on the ground below, as well as all air vehicles in low altitude airspace. Government, industry partners, and academia have collaborated for the past decade to develop an understanding and potential solutions to the communication deficiencies between sUAS operators, air traffic controllers, and air vehicles. These activities have paved the way for dramatic innovation to overcome the deficiencies in situation awareness of sUAS operators and air traffic controllers with regard to proximity operations of sUAS with each other, ground-based obstacles and potentially manned aircraft. This research has proposed system architectures based upon the needs of government and commercial entities. Simultaneously, the hobbyist community has also recognized this problem and began developing competitive technologies consistent with their perceived needs. These solutions vary along multiple dimensions, including safety, security, and cost. This paper will employ Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) to perform an architectural analysis of technologies related to the emerging solution set with the goal of uncovering a promising architecture solution for the future of UAS traffic management (UTM) which provides the potential for an integrated solution between these communities.",La Monica C.,Conference Proceeding,AIAA/IEEE Digital Avionics Systems Conference - Proceedings,2021-01-01,Air Force Institute of Technology,air traffic controller ;  air traffic safety ;  collision avoidance ;  drones ;  small UAS ;  sUAS (Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems) ;  UAS (Unmanned Aircraft Systems) ;  UAS Autonomy ;  UAS Traffic Management (UTM)
Formation of Modern Open Educational Space,"Rapid technological progress demands changing the traditional model of modern open educational space, which will meet the challenges of the digital era of the university community transformation. Within the traditional model of open education, there is a significant gap between the real sector of the economy and the innovations market. Thus, the educational programs offered by the university, as well as the graduates entering the labor market are not competitive. One of the key disadvantages of the current model is the fact that education is now regarded as a space where the specialists are trained at the request of an abstract customer through Federal State Educational Standards (FSES). FSES 3++ standards will not be able to bridge the existing gap with the real requests for the current competencies of the university graduates because the competencies of the professional standards are often focused on very general and out-of-date requests of their developers. The general disadvantage of the traditional model is training specialists for the existing jobs. Thus, the added value of such education is very low and as a result, there is a low level of the graduate's employment and a need for their external ""retraining"" to achieve the requested competencies. The purpose of our research was to develop the Open University model in which the cooperation of all the participants of the educational process will focus on training a unique specialist whose education will be performed by a researcher-innovator. To achieve that it is necessary to change the whole educational paradigm and to train specialists not for the existing jobs (initial professional training) but for the newly appearing technologically advanced jobs which may not yet be numerous in the real sector of the economy. That demands changes in the modern university ecosystem when the teacher shifts from being a mere transmitter of explicit knowledge to being a researcher-innovator. It is not possible without reconstructing the supporting infrastructure of the open educational space.",Mineva O.; Polyanskaya E.,Conference Proceeding,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2021-01-01,Astrakhan State University,"""Open University"" ;  Digital platform ;  Open educational space ;  Researcher-innovator ;  STEAM ;  STEM ;  Unique specialist"
SMART WEARABLE DEVICE INTEGRATE HEALTH INSURANCE WITH THE APPLICATION OF TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE MODEL AND INNOVATION RESISTANCE THEORY,"With the progress of medical science and technology and the improvement of public education, people gradually realize the importance of paying attention to personal health. However, financial and insurance industry also see this trend and broad business opportunities to develop insurance products combining wearable devices with health management. This study explores the public’s willingness to insure for smart wearable devices combined with health management insurance through technology acceptance model, and further tests whether the variables of innovation resistance theory have moderating effects on people’s perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and insurance willingness. Empirical research was used convenient sampling to collect 575 questionnaires. Perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use will positively significantly the insurance willingness of smart wearable devices combined with health management insurance. However, value barriers of innovation resistance theory can affect the insurance willingness and risk barriers have moderating effects on perceived usefulness and insurance willingness. The technology acceptance model can really explain the insurance willingness. However, the value barrier of innovation resistance theory will affect the insurance willingness. This shows that there are still many market topics and marketing space for this innovative commodity. This study also finds that risk barrier has a moderating effect. For this innovative commodity will indeed increase the willingness to insure, but there are still some doubts about the combination of innovation in the risk barriers. This result can provide relevant enterprises with marketing strategy to enhance the insurance willingness and reduce the awareness of innovation resistance.",Lin W.; Chen H.,Journal,Journal of Quality,2021-01-01,National Taipei University of Business,Healthy management insurance ;  Innovation resistance theory ;  Smart wearable device ;  Technology acceptance model
How the industrial internet of things changes business models in different manufacturing industries,"The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) poses large impacts on business models (BM) of established manufacturing companies within several industries. Thus, this paper aims at analyzing the influence of the IIoT on these BMs with particular respect to differences and similarities dependent on varying industry sectors. For this purpose, we employ an exploratory multiple case study approach based on semi-structured expert interviews in 69 manufacturing companies from the five most important German industries.

End(s) of the Harmonization in the European Union: Centrifuging or Engineering?,"The European Union (EU) harmonization has an evolving and dynamic nature. Different theoretical approaches (e.g., regulatory competition, coevolution, reflexive harmonization) are often echoed to delve into the EU harmonization. This article, going through these theories, endeavors to explain the harmonization discourse in the EU with a focus on the electronic communications sector. To understand the trajectory of the EU harmonization in this sector, two areas (“network access” and “spectrum regulation”) are selected as the subject-matter of the research.

Use of clay-containing tailings in geopolymer production,"This paper stresses the enormous contribution made by L. A. Vaysberg (1944- 2020), Doctor of Technical Sciences, professor, academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences, research supervisor at Mekhanobr-Tekhnika and Russia’s lead expert in mineral and man-made materials processing and mechanical engineering for the mining industry, to the design, engineering and operation of vibration machines that are used in mining, construction and recycling industries. Under Vaysberg’s leadership, Mekhanobr-Tekhnika realized a number of complex innovation projects aimed at developing and implementing on a large scale energy- and resource-saving technologies and equipment for mining, metallurgy and construction applications, as well as for the recycling industry that deals with the processing of various materials, including industrial and household waste. Today, the equipment produced by company is also used by the construction industry and for revamping of crushing, screening, asphalt and concrete production sites and other industries. This paper examines the effect of thermochemical modification on the separation of clay-containing ore slurries. Such sites as tailings ponds and landfills, which carry liquid phase, should minimize their environmental impact and ensure health safety. One of the possible ways to dispose of tailings is to utilize them as pozzolanic additives for cements (a mineral additive capable of bonding Ca(OH)2 into stable hydrates) and as a raw material for producing geopolymers. The authors look at the effect of various parameters on the way geopolymers form and on their properties. It was found that the process of thermochemical modification makes it possible to utilize the tailings of clay-containing ores as a raw material in geopolymer production.",Arsentiev V.; Gerasimov A.,Journal,Tsvetnye Metally,2021-01-01,Research and Engineering Corporation,Clay-containing tailings ;  Composite materials ;  Geopolymers ;  Hardening backfill mixture ;  Thermochemical modification
Think tank for the strengthening of leadership and empowerment of Colombian women in STEM,"In recent decades, global efforts have been made to reduce gender inequality in STEM participation (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). Despite the visibility of the problem and the significant progress achieved, inequality persists today. According to UNESCO, in higher education, only 35% of students enrolled in STEM-related careers are women and researchers worldwide, only 28% are women. Still gender stereotypes and prejudices compromise the quality of education for students. According to the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation, the data shows an even more worrying landscape for Colombian women because only 2% of Colombian women choose to study STEM careers, and the percentage of female researchers is less than 40%. In order to address this problem and propose solutions, the Think tank attached to the National University of Colombia is created to strengthen the leadership of Colombian women in STEM areas and promote their empowerment as students, professionals, and researchers, via spaces for reflection, analysis, and research that, developing collaborative work in networks with interested actors, lead to the elaboration of public policies proposals and concrete actions that reduce the gender gap in education and the professional practice of science. And technologies in Colombia. Among the fundamental initial actions is the collection and analysis of data about the participation of women in the roles of students, teachers, academic and professional directors so that the data is applied to the construction of reliable indicators that show the magnitude of the gender gap in STEM areas in different areas. In addition, we aim to co-construct public policy proposals to help achieve gender equality and promote STEM careers by young people and the participation of women in leadership and power roles in professional and academic fields in Colombia.",Herrera L.; Botero-Fernández V.; Guzmán M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the LACCEI international Multi-conference for Engineering, Education and Technology",2021-01-01,Universidad Nacional de Colombia;Universidad Nacional de Colombia Medellin,Empowerment ;  Equity ;  Gender gap ;  Women in STEM
Fostering Soft Skills in Engineering in the Education 4.0 Framework,"The soft skills required in the Fourth Industrial Revolution make the traditional logical-scientific thought modality (used in engineering teaching methods) insufficient for the degree of innovation and disruption required by the international labor agenda. That is why the need arises to consider specific educational innovations for the new curricular programs that mean an improvement in training and study plans. Universities and other institutions of higher education are at this time with a double commitment: to meet the needs and requirements raised by employers and flexibly adapt andragogic approaches to their teaching-learning techniques. The present work shows the results and findings of the educational implementation of different cognitive theories, specifically adapted for engineering students belonging to the Y/Z generations, who received specialized instruction in the narrative-creative thinking modality to: acquire transversal competences of a high degree of innovation and integrate flexible and divergent perspectives. The research was carried out with an experimental mixed methodology on a sample of 601 students, who were evaluated with different types of instruments to know the level of acquisition of eight transversal competences. The analysis of the results obtained in twelve semesters shows that the designed approach promoted the desired skills among engineering students, with a better understanding of scientific concepts and additionally, a greater capacity and intellectual commitment to transform ideas and solutions.",Caratozzolo P.; Alvarez-Delgado A.; Gonzalez-Pineda Z.; Sirkis G.; Piloto C.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the LACCEI international Multi-conference for Engineering, Education and Technology",2021-01-01,Universidad del CEMA;Massachusetts Institute of Technology;Tecnológico de Monterrey,Critical thinking ;  Educational innovation ;  Engineering soft skills ;  Fourth industrial revolution ;  Higher education
Applied mathematical analysis of organizational learning culture and new media technology acceptance based on regression statistical software and a moderated mediator model,"In the hypercompetitive environment of the digital age, new media technologies are regarded as useful methods for improving organizational effectiveness and innovation. Using hierarchical regression equation and statistical software SPSS 22.0, this paper aims to explore the relationship between organizational learning culture and new media technology acceptance (NMTA), as well as the roles of organizational loyalty and personal innovativeness in state-owned companies. A total of 20161 valid questionnaires were collected for the final analysis. Based on a moderated mediator model and the bootstrapping method, the research indicates that there is a positive relationship between perceived organizational learning culture and NMTA. In addition, the effect of perceived organizational learning culture on NMTA is partially mediated by organizational loyalty. And personal innovativeness moderates the direct effect of perceived organizational learning culture on NMTA and indirect effect via organizational loyalty. The study offers implications for managers to promote the widespread use of new media technology in companies.

ENHANCING ABDUCTIVE REASONING in DESIGN and ENGINEERING EDUCATION VIA PROBABILISTIC KNOWLEDGE; A CASE STUDY in AI,"As we are moving into a knowledge-based economy, frameworks addressing the translational processes around value and impact permeate the development of educational curriculums in the design and engineering educational spectrum. In response to this approach, this paper presents an operational framework that explores how abductive reasoning, and its embodied probabilistic knowledge can bridge the gap between the challenges of accelerating technological development and current design and engineering educational practice. This is to enable students to locate, evaluate and work creatively with knowledge to generate new and improved solutions that can tackle uncertain and future real-world challenges, while delivering impact and value for society. In the process, we introduce probabilistic knowledge as the most adequate model to translate potentialities into impact and value. This repositioning enables practitioners to move beyond proving reality to a generative space aiming to transform it. In this context we present abductive reasoning as a fundamental approach to deal with directional and transformational potentialities to tackle uncertainties.",Galdon F.; Hall A.; Ferrarelo L.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education, E and PDE 2021",2021-01-01,Royal College of Art,Abductive reasoning ;  Innovation research ;  Probabilistic knowledge ;  Prospective
"Linking digital technologies to learning in higher education: Skills, tools and practices","The innovation and rapid growth of internet technologies and devices have brought changes to the higher education landscape. Technologies such as virtual learning environments, cloud services, synchronous and asynchronous communication tools that can be accessed via the Internet have gradually emerged and gained ground, reshaping students' academic practices in different ways. Despite that, research shows that the potential of internet technologies to enhance students' learning experience has not been fully exploited. Several studies have reported that internet technologies in academic settings are used for convenience rather than for strengthening students' academic study habits. Additionally, according to research, higher education students are not aware of the enabling capabilities of internet technologies and how they can be used in the context of higher education. This paper presents part of a design-based research study that aimed to develop an instructional intervention that enhances undergraduate students' internet skills in the context of higher education. The intervention was based on the internet skills indicators from the Internet Skills Scale (ISS) proposed by Van Deursen, Helsper & Eynon (2014), which was validated for the context of higher education. To guide the intervention, we have developed a framework that links internet skills to internet technologies and their educational affordances in academic settings. The framework refers to five types of skills: Operational, Information-Navigation, Social, Creative, and Critical. For each of the skills' type, several internet technologies have been identified together with their potential to support academic practice. The framework can serve as a tool to perceive the affordances of internet technologies for learning in higher education and prepare higher education staff to better support the effective and productive use of the Internet in academic environments.",Miliou O.; Angeli C.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the European Conference on e-Learning, ECEL",2021-01-01,University of Cyprus,Academic practice ;  Educational affordances ;  Framework ;  Higher education ;  Internet skills ;  Internet technologies
How to drive innovation by tapping into the intrapreneurial capabilities of engineers?: A case study of a fintech sme,"Intrapreneurship has been gaining momentum in organizations for self-renewal, driving growth, and taking the business to new heights. Technology firms are running on challenging innovative capabilities while striving to achieve competitive advantage and survive in a complex and high volatile business environment. Such firms must speed up the intrapreneurial process initiated by their engineers in more efficient and productive ways. Engineers are considered the backbone and main assets in technology firms to explore new opportunities and develop innovative products, solutions, and services. These firms require their engineers to adopt more intrapreneurial roles and operate with an intrapreneurial mindset to accelerate innovation. It becomes imperative for these firms to promote intrapreneurship as a core business strategy and discover their engineers' talents in this context. However, researchers have not explored the driving factors of intrapreneurship among engineers and how an organization can empower them to act more intrapreneurial. It is, therefore, one of the key research gaps in the fields of intrapreneurship and engineering. This paper addresses these gaps and explores how SME organizations can inspire and motivate their engineers to become intrapreneurs and develop new innovation capabilities. This exploratory study follows qualitative research using case study methodology. The data is collected through semi-structured interviews with managers and engineers from a FinTech firm based in the UK. Our exploration study results reveal that the internal enabling factors of intrapreneurship among engineers in SMEs are much more interactive and multifaceted. These factors are related to ‘supportive management’, ‘intrapreneurial culture’, and ‘strategic orientation’ with a combination of various sub-constructs of each. The firm succeeded in building a supportive culture driven by the Kaizen process that actively engages engineers in suggesting and implementing improvement to the company and contributes effectively to its success through innovation. As a result, engineers feel they are trusted, and their contribution is valued and rewarded. They can take ownership and act proactively and deliver results beyond their duties. The results will help firms understand the intrapreneurial potential of engineers and build a supporting organizational framework conducive to intrapreneurship in which the engineers' intrapreneurial capabilities are unleashed and stimulated.",Alzyadat M.; Baruah B.; Ward A.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE",2021-01-01,University of York,Engineer ;  Fintech ;  Innovation ;  Intrapreneur ;  Intrapreneurship ;  Intrapreneurship enabling factors
Shaping the pathways to entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurial education in romanian technical universities,"Over the last twenty years, universities have been facing a period of profound changes and unprecedented challenges with an increased pressure from different stakeholders requiring universities to play an active role in innovation and entrepreneurial education, both in terms of mindset and practical instruments. At the same time, education seems to be an important tool for stimulating entrepreneurship (Backes-Gellner & Werner, 2007; Harris & Gibson, 2008; Kuratko, 2005; Raposo & Do Paço, 2011) as extensive research provides evidence that there is a positive and robust link between entrepreneurial education and entrepreneurship performance (The Small Business Economy, 2007). The main goal of the research was to explore the way Romanian technical universities are adapting to the new market and educational challenges and are embedding entrepreneurship in their curricular and extracurricular activities to enhance entrepreneurial competences in engineering students. The research questions that guided the study were: 1. How are Romanian technical universities infusing an entrepreneurial mindset in engineering students? 2. Which are the engineering programs that implement most entrepreneurial education courses? 3. What are the most frequent entrepreneurship related extracurricular activities implemented in universities? The research was conducted on 5 major Romanian technical universities. The analysis was conducted using a two-step approach: first, a critical analysis of the literature discussing the concepts of entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial education and entrepreneurial university and the role of technical Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in shaping entrepreneurial competencies in engineering students and secondly, an exploratory empirical content analysis of the 5 Romanian technical universities' websites and curricula in order to identify the courses covering topics related to entrepreneurship and the extracurricular activities implemented throughout the university during the 2020-2021 academic year.",Șerban A.; Alexa L.; Maier V.; Crăciunescu R.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE",2021-01-01,Universitatea Tehnica din Cluj-Napoca;Universitatea Lucian Blaga din Sibiu;Universitatea Tehnica Gh.

Innovation in accounting education: The impact of information technology on teaching methods,"Professional accountants today face many challenges caused by many factors, most notably the evolution of information technology-the digital revolution. Professional accountants are required to possess specific knowledge and skills inherent to the accounting profession, as well as generic skills. Higher education in accounting is one of the fundamental forms of formal education that enables professional accountants to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills and to develop professional competence. In accounting education, understanding the role of the modern professional accountant, required knowledge and skills, serves as the basis for establishing relevant teaching areas, units, and learning outcomes. Accounting education should consider market requirements related to the necessary skills and knowledge of professional accountants, and adjust accounting curriculum as well as teaching methods accordingly. In this regard, teaching methods are linked to learning outcomes and they should enable accounting graduates to acquire labour market-relevant skills and knowledge. There is a continuing need to adjust accounting education to market demands in the wake of ongoing academic discussions about the existing gap between accounting education and requirements of accounting practice. The aim of the paper is to explore current innovative teaching methods in higher education in accounting, with a particular focus on the means of integrating information technology (IT/ICT) into accounting education, based on a literature review of relevant sources. The paper also explores how innovative teaching methods affect the development of skills required of a modern professional accountant. The development of information technologies affects the content of education as well as teaching methods. A review of recent literature also focuses on analyzing the use of innovative teaching methods based on student attitudes and examines the level of information technology integration in accounting education and its impact on learning outcomes. The research findings contribute to the understanding of innovation in accounting education, summarizing new teaching methods and the impact of information technology in that context.

Research on innovative methods based on clustering and case-based reasoning,"Innovation is one of the decisive factors for the prosperity of an enterprise. The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) is an effective method to promote system innovative design. However, TRIZ solution is a highly abstract conceptual solution, and its transformation to a specific solution requires a large amount of rich knowledge from different engineering fields. Designers themselves cannot master all the supporting knowledge required for problem solving, which increases the difficulty of TRIZ in practical application. In order to overcome these difficulties, this paper presents a method synthesizing TRIZ, CBR and GHSOM, in which TRIZ can systematically generate innovative solutions, CBR makes designers take full advantage of past experience and knowledge to transform abstract TRIZ solutions into solutions to specific design problems, and GHSOM as a clustering tool expands the scope of knowledge utilization and promote the diversification of design solutions. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the method.",Shang K.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,2021-01-01,Yellow River Conservancy Technical Institute;Wuhan University of Technology,Case-based reasoning ;  GHSOM ;  Innovative design ;  Similarity measurement ;  TRIZ

Appreciative inquiry to promote innovation culture in industrial engineering students,"This research aims to determine how appreciative inquiry promoted the culture of innovation in an engineering school and based on the results that were obtained to propose a plan of activities. Appreciative inquiry took place in a school of industrial engineering at the university in northern Peru, where thirty-seven students participated. These students participated through interviews and surveys by inquiring them about the best of what they have done in order to imagine what could be. Then a survey is conducted to determine the student perception of corporate style about the industrial engineering program (IEP). Analyzing the data, the hypothesis is accepted: That appreciative inquiry has promoted the culture of innovation in the industrial engineering program. This can be evidenced in the participation in more academic events, meeting and courses, in national and international calls about innovation, etc. Results obtained by students forced to the IEP to a greater participation and involvement in a process towards a culture of innovation.",Ulloa M.; Lujan M.; Reyes J.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management,2021-01-01,Universidad Católica Santo Toribio de Mogrovejo;Comercio-Group;Decorlux-SAC Enterprises,Appreciative inquiry ;  Culture ;  Engineering ;  Industrial ;  Innovation
"‘New normality’ of the covid-19 era: Opportunities, limitations, risks","The article considers some key aspects of the current transformation of social reality. The author argues that the announcement of the pandemic determined an unprecedented situation: humanity faces a completely different concept of reality. In particular, the breakthrough in the development of NBIC technologies (nano, bio, new information and cognitive technologies) contributes to the strengthening of the paradigm that absolutizes the technocratic component of civilizational development. Under the general depression and decline in economic activity, there is an explosive growth in the field of bioengineering, information and cognitive research. The ‘new normality’ of the coronavirus era, associated with the unprecedented development of artificial intelligence systems, video surveillance technologies, geolocation and ‘big data’, in an unusually short time has created new existential and legal problems. The proclaimed threat to public health, being a significant goal-setting, has become a dominant justification for the introduction of serious innovations that allow the ruling elites to block civil rights, in particular, to legalize the use of tracking systems. Under the fight against the pandemic, the personal identification systems based on advanced technologies are being transformed from a security tool of law enforcement agencies into a tool of mass social engineering. Russia has come close to a new stage of digital transformation — a state-wide credential management system (the Unified Federal Information Register). Considering the experience of China in digital segregation, concerns arise: will digitalization turn into something dangerous as the algorithms of artificial intelligence improve, the use of biometric surveillance broaden, etc.? The article emphasizes that scanning the appearance and collecting information about citizens allows to create a gigantic array of data, the use of which can have unpredictable consequences, and the problem of their unauthorized use is not the main one. The power of algorithms, which allows to manipulate a person by means of continuously collected information about him, can turn into a new, sophisticated form of genocide.",Gnatik E.,Journal,RUDN Journal of Sociology,2021-01-01,RUDN University,Covid-19 pandemic ;  Human rights ;  NBIС-technologies ;  State coercive apparatus ;  Transformation of social reality
Intellectual capital and innovation management: Small and medium leather and footwear companies in Tungurahua – Ecuador,"The interrelation between innovation and intellectual capital is probably one of the most complex issues from the perspective of South America, because the new technological paradigm poses extraordinary challenges for the region. This research aims to determine the relationship between intellectual capital and innovation management in small and medium leather and footwear companies in Tungurahua-Ecuador. The research is of a non-experimental type, because it studies phenomena in their natural state to later analyze and explain them; mixed, with an emphasis on the qualitative approach, with a sample of 45 companies. The results show a low level of job satisfaction and stability in the analysis of human capital; In addition, in innovation there is a need for training in topics such as production, process engineering, shoe costs, basic modeling, biomechanics in footwear, design and style. In conclusion, contributions were generated in technology and skills development, identifying areas in which SMEs should pay attention to be productive, since it is not yet possible to change the productive matrix in these businesses, since there is no capacity to exports and research and innovation in science and knowledge management is insufficient.",Juan Carlos E.,Journal,Revista de Ciencias Sociales,2021-01-01,Universidad Católica de Cuenca,calzado ;  Capital intelectual ;  footwear ;  industria ;  industry ;  innovación ;  innovation ;  Intellectual capital ;  progreso tecnológico ;  technological progress
The Student-Centered STEM Learning Model Based on Artificial Intelligence Project: A Case Study on Intelligent Car,"Artificial intelligence has become a crucial technology for the development of the times. In the practice of emerging engineering education about artificial intelligence, how to enhance students' understanding of artificial intelligence technology, strengthen students' enthusiasm for learning, and improve their innovation ability is a key issue. This research constructs a novel Student-Centered STEM Learning Model (SC-STEM-LM), compensating for engineering students' lack of innovative practice in high education. First, students use real projects as the background to find technical literature and make learning plans. Then, they carry out four STEM learning activities at the same time in cooperation. Finally, the students cultivate their innovation ability by improving the performance of the project. Furthermore, taking the intelligent car target tracking system as an example, we voluntarily recruit ten students with similar abilities from the school of computer science and randomly divide them into two groups (experimental group and control group) to verify the learning effect. In addition, to objectively evaluate the actual effect of the SCSTEM-LM, we also propose a new weighted multi-evaluation algorithm. The results show that the score of the experimental group is 82.84, which is 8.86 higher than the control group.",Liao J.; Yang J.; Zhang W.,Journal,International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning,2021-01-01,Minnan Normal University;Fujian Province University,Artificial Intelligence ;  Intelligent Car ;  Multiple Evaluation ;  Stem Education ;  Student Centered Stem Learning Model
Development and performance analysis of hemispherical piezoelectric transducer for road applications,"Following the extensive research on piezoelectric technology and the increasing popularity of intelligent transportation during the past few years, the harvesting of pavement vibration energy has attracted increased research attention. At present, most innovations in the direction of the road piezoelectric energy are focused on the materials and structures of the transducers. However, few transducers meet the road requirements. Therefore, in this study, a hemispherical piezoelectric transducer was developed for road applications. We also analyzed the effects of different sizes and structures of transducers on energy harvesting efficiency based on laboratory tests, and the outcomes were compared with those from plane transducers. Under the excitation frequency of 10 Hz and the load of 0.7 MPa, the maximum output power of the planar transducer was 0.422 mW, while the power of the hemispherical transducer at the same load was 0.765 mW. Based on the dynamic load test, the ultimate load of the hemispheric transducer was 1900 N, which was 2.66 times that under standard axial load. Subsequently, a dynamic fatigue test was conducted for 24 h at the excitation conditions of 10 Hz and 0.7 MPa, wherein the voltage attenuation of the plane transducer exceeded 60%, while that of the hemispheric transducer was <20%. The experimental results show that the structure had a stable performance and good durability, and its strength and acquisition efficiency met the requirements of road transducers.",Wang J.; Qin X.; Liu Z.; Ding G.,Journal,Ferroelectrics,2021-01-01,Wenzhou University,hemispherical structure ;  Intelligent transportation ;  pavement engineering ;  piezoelectric transducer ;  vibration energy harvesting

User Acceptance of Lifelogging Technologies: The Power of Experience and Technological Self-Efficacy,"Today, innovations in the field of lifelogging technology and its assistance in everyday life enable different users to gain an overview of different areas of their lives. Especially for older and frail people, lifelogging offers useful solutions that allow them to stay longer in their private environment and maintain their autonomy. Although lifelogging is already used in many contexts, opinions of users on the different lifelogging applications and the influence of user characteristics on their acceptance still remain underexplored. In this study, we investigate the acceptance of lifelogging technology for activities of daily living and examine the impact of user characteristics on its key determinants according to the Technology Acceptance Model, which is used as a theoretical background. For data collection we used a quantitative online survey and took opinions of N=209 German adults into consideration in the statistical analyses. Our findings demonstrate that an already existing experience with lifelogging is the main influencing factor for user acceptance: High levels of the experience and technological self-efficacy in handling of the technology significantly enhance the acceptance of lifelogging for activities of daily living, while age and gender shape the acceptance indirectly. This study contributes to the user acceptance research of lifelogging in private environments, and our findings deepen the understanding of how adoption of lifelogging technologies is shaped by different users.",Wilkowska W.; Offermann-Van Heek J.; Ziefle M.,Conference Proceeding,"International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies for Ageing Well and e-Health, ICT4AWE - Proceedings",2021-01-01,Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen,Lifelogging Experience ;  Lifelogging Technology ;  Technological Self-Efficacy ;  Technology Acceptance

Experimental teaching of information security based on virtual simulation,"In information security technology, virtual simulation technology has been applied in many fields, and its value has been proven and has attracted people's attention. Especially today, as a new type of computer model, virtual simulation covers the Internet and plays an important role in the information security research of big data platforms. This thesis aims to study and solve the problem of lack of experimental environment for information security technology in schools and to bring new teaching methods to the experimental teaching of information security technology in schools. At the same time, it emphasizes the teaching characteristics of the platform based on technology implementation and combines the cognition of high school students in the design and implementation of the platform. After understanding the main points, a research teaching design was carried out, which made up for the current virtual simulation experiment platform that pays attention to technology but despises teaching design. As a result of the empirical analysis, the virtual experiment simulation platform can solve the problems in the school's information security technology experiment teaching, increase students' interest in information security technology, and achieve the educational goal of cultivating students' independent innovation spirit and practical ability. From 2014 to 2016, the Ministry of Education started the construction of virtual simulation information security experiment teaching. Currently, 290 virtual simulation information security experiment teaching has been implemented and distributed in 26 provinces and cities, of which 199 are engineering, 81 are finance, and 10 are education.",Dai X.,Journal,Mobile Information Systems,2021-01-01,Chengdu Normal University,

Energy from biomass and plastics recycling: a review,"The sustainability of fossil fuel is not guaranteed as it is gradually depleting. Alternative ways to this challenge are to generate biofuel from biomass and plastic solid wastes. Many studies have been done on the actualization of these alternatives. Hence, this study accumulates research from multidiscipline for the purpose of advancing biofuel production for sustainable energy. The necessary information needed by scientists having interest in biofuel production, including government policy, biomass selection, different conversion techniques and different ASTM standards for biodiesel properties are entrenched in this study. For vast biofuel production, there is a need for a collaborative work among fields from microbiologist, biochemist to engineering for the development of innovations, growth of cells, understanding of genetic engineering of algae strains and optimization of biofuel production. Also, a review on the recovery and recycling process of plastic solid waste was done. This is to ensure that the use of plastic solid waste to support energy sustenance will lead to no energy is wasted. Various ASTM standards for investigating the different properties of bio-oil were reviewed. The numerous plastic wastes that have not been utilized in the production of biofuel can be investigated to reduce the environmental pollution.",Adegoke S.; Adeleke A.; Ikubanni P.; Nnodim C.; Balogun A.; Falode O.; Adetona S.,Journal,Cogent Engineering,2021-01-01,Landmark University;University of Ibadan;Petroleum Training Institute,bioenergy ;  biofuel production ;  biomass ;  conversion process ;  land usage ;  plastic wastes

Application of Artificial Intelligence Techniques in Operating Mode of Professors' Academic Governance in American Research Universities,"Artificial intelligence technology is an important transformative force for teaching innovation in the intelligent era. It is being widely used in American school teaching, including the design of intelligent tutoring systems to achieve precise problem solving, the machine learning technology to ensure personalized activity design, the creation of intelligent virtual reality to promote classroom teaching contextualization, and the development of intelligent evaluation systems to ensure the scientific evaluation of capabilities. In the process of advancing the teaching and application of artificial intelligence technology, the United States has built a linkage mechanism of federal leadership, university follow-up, and social collaboration and implemented the smart technology in school teaching and professors' academic governance. This paper is aimed at studying the professors' academic governance of American research universities by Internet data mining, historical analysis method, documentary method, survey method, and other methods. Professors' academic governance is a vital part of the modern university system that causes the institutional reform of the internal governance structure of modern universities. The United States is a powerful country in higher education, and professors in American research universities have always participated in university academic governance for centuries. By studying the definition, history, and development and mode of operation of professors' academic governance in American research universities, the results indicate a clear division of power and responsibility between the professors and administrators based on an artificial intelligence decision system in American research universities. Also, there is a good communication platform based on artificial intelligence environment for professors to discuss their opinions on academic affairs. Third, professors exercise academic power under the guarantee of diversified guaranteed systems based on the artificial intelligence evaluation system and the ideology of mutual respect based on the artificial intelligence management and service system. Studying the application of artificial intelligence techniques in operating mode and enlightenment of professors' academic governance in an American research university is of great significance to promote the construction of other modern universities' professors' academic governance system.",Wang R.; Li J.; Shi W.; Li X.,Journal,Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,2021-01-01,"Foreign Studies College of Northeastern University;School of Humanities and Law, Northeastern University;Northeastern University;Nanjing Normal University",
Examining goal congruence on engineering design and innovation student teams,"Goal congruence, defined as agreement by all members of a team on a common set of objectives, has been positively associated with team cohesion, team performance and team outcomes, including grades earned. Yet there is little in-depth study at scale and across types of engineering design and innovation classes in higher education that examines the goals students set for their work together. This research explores goal congruence in 857 teams involving 1470 students across 18 classes over four years. To examine goal congruence, we use student assessments of their level of agreement on their goals as well as evaluations of their written goal statements. Machine learning techniques are used to automatically identify goal types and congruence between goals. We find that goal congruence on student teams is relatively low, even when they assess it as high, partly due to variety in the types of goals they identify. We categorize the goals students articulate for their teams into grade-, completion-, teaming-, learning-, problem-, output- and outcome-oriented goals and report variance in the types of goals identified in different pedagogical settings. Our findings have implications for how faculty design their classes, link learning outcomes to team projects and facilitate goal setting on student teams.",Beckman S.; Jian A.; Sabharwal A.; Goucher-Lambert K.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference,2021-01-01,"Department of Mechanical Engineering;Haas School of Business;University of California, Berkeley",Cooperative learning ;  Goal congruence ;  Learning objectives ;  Problem-based learning ;  Teams
Exploration of the digital innovation process in the smart product-service system,"The dissemination of digital technologies enabled massive data generation and new forms of cooperation. Hence, a new type of innovation named digital innovation emerged. Digital innovation has evolved in different domains and contexts, one of which is called Smart Product-Service System (Smart PSS). Many research works have been done on the development of Smart PSS by leveraging various digital technologies and exploiting its digital capabilities along its lifecycle to generate personalized and innovative solutions. However, there are scarcely any works to explore how the digital innovation process can be manifested to fully exploit digital capabilities throughout Smart PSS development. Aiming to fill this gap, this research provides a theoretical basis for digital innovation in Smart PSS and investigates how it can be in line with the development of Smart PSS from an engineering lifecycle perspective. This work also provides a definition of Smart PSS from the context of digital innovation. A case study on smart office chair is employed to demonstrate the digital innovation process in the usage stage. This work can provide insight and guidance for Smart PSS development and further harness its digital innovation process.",Saymeh H.; Zhang X.; Peng T.; Tang R.; Wang Z.; Zheng P.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference,2021-01-01,"School of Mechanical Engineering, Zhejiang University;School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering;The Hong Kong Polytechnic University",Data-driven approach ;  Digital capabilities ;  Digital innovation ;  Engineering lifecycle ;  Smart product-service system
Can gratitude promote more creative engineering design?,"Urgent societal problems, including climate change, require innovation, and can benefit from interdisciplinary solutions. A small body of research has demonstrated the potential of positive emotions (e.g., gratitude, awe) to promote creativity and prosocial behavior, which may help address these problems. This study integrates, for the first time, psychology research on a positive and prosocial emotion (i.e., gratitude) with engineering-design creativity research. In a pre-registered study design, engineering students and working engineers (pilot N = 49; full study N = 329) completed gratitude, positive-emotion control, or neutral-control inductions. Design creativity was assessed through rater scores of responses to an Alternate Uses Task (AUT) and a Wind-Turbine-Blade Repurposing Task (WRT). No significant differences among AUT scores emerged across conditions in either sample. While only the pilot-study manipulation of gratitude was successful, WRT results warrant further studies on the effect of gratitude on engineering-design creativity. The reported work may also inform other strategies to incorporate prosocial emotion to help engineers arrive at more original and effective concepts to tackle environmental sustainability, and in the future, other problems facing society.",Sisson N.; Impett E.; Shu L.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference,2021-01-01,University of Toronto,Alternate uses task ;  Creativity ;  Gratitude ;  Wind-turbine-blade repurposing

There is no “I” in team but there is in innovation: How individual attributes impact team ideation and selection practices,"While teaming is a vital component of engineering, it is important to remember that there is no team without individuals and individual behavior can drive team outputs. One of these individual factors that may manifest itself at the team level is individual risk-taking attitudes, which can be impacted by personality and preferences for creativity. However, a gap exists in research on the impact of the team composition in these factors on creative outputs, as previous research has found that team composition plays a key role in team performance. The current work was developed to examine how the elevation and diversity of team personality and preferences for creativity impact the novelty and quality of ideas generated and selected by the team through a simulation study of 60,831 simulated teams. The results of this study show that the novelty and quality of ideas generated and selected can be predicted by the elevation and diversity of the simulated teams’ personality and PCS factors. In addition, it was found that the impact of the individual elevation and diversity factors can vary depending on the ideation trait (novelty and quality) and design stage (concept generation and selection). However, there was one variable that had a consistent positive impact on team behavior – the elevation of the Creative Confidence of the Simulated Team Members. These findings provide preliminary evidence on how individual attributes manifest themselves at the team level to impact team ideation and selection performances.",Peng A.; Hunter S.; Miller S.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference,2021-01-01,Penn State College of Engineering;Pennsylvania State University,Design decision making ;  Design education ;  Design methodology ;  Design theory and methodology
"Impacts of coastal armouring on rubble mobile cryptofauna at shallow coral reefs in Okinawa, Japan","Shoreline armouring has progressively affected the coastal landscapes of countries all over the world, and armouring construction will increase in coming years as a consequence of climate change. Armouring has the potential to affect coastal environments and induce changes in the abundance and diversity of marine communities, and its effects might by increased by wide adoption. Moreover, compared with temperate locations, the effects of armouring have been less studied in tropical and subtropical areas. Okinawa Island, the largest and most populated island of the Ryukyu Archipelago in southern Japan, has been affected by numerous civil and military engineering works. After decades of development, less than 40% of its coastline remains natural, and yet impacts from armouring on local marine communities have been overlooked until recent years. The aim of this research was to evaluate effects of near-shore armouring on the surrounding environment by comparing diversity and abundance of coral rubble mobile cryptofauna benthic communities between armoured and control sites. Across six different geographic locations, coral rubble was sampled in front of subtidal breakwaters and at nearby control sites. Armoured sites were associated with lower cryptofauna abundances and reduced richness and diversity at higher taxonomic levels (phylum and class). Reduction in spatial complexity could be a plausible reason for the observed patterns. Impacts could be mitigated by combining technical innovations, habitat restoration, and use of natural spaces as buffers for coastal protection. Since less than half of Okinawa Island’s coastline remains in a natural state, environmental conservation should be prioritized.",Masucci G.; Biondi P.; Reimer J.,Journal,Plankton and Benthos Research,2021-01-01,Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University;University of the Ryukyus;The Oceancy MTÜ,Coastal armouring ;  Coastal development ;  Conservation ;  Coral reefs ;  Cryptic diversity

Analysis of the relationship between student profiles and the results obtained in a university course gamification study,"The objective of this study was to understand the ways that different personality traits of students affect their gamification experiences within the university educational context. The effectiveness of implemented gamification within the aforementioned context was also measured. A required class in the industrial engineering course was gamified in order to conduct this research. The effectiveness average of the gamification in engaging students was 83% and increased motivation among students in the classroom was also observed in the results. Cluster analysis verified that students with the best performance in the gamified course were those who exhibited medium high levels of personality traits linked with conscientiousness, extroversion, and openness to experiences. The results highlight the value of gamification and the need to move from the 'one-size-fits-all' approach to more personalised applications.

This study aims to identify the assets and challenges that engineering faculty at HSIs perceive impact their ability to engage in educational innovation and, ultimately, create inclusive and learner-centered educational experiences. Specifically, the thematic analysis of workshop artifacts enabled the researchers to examine the perspectives of 24 engineering educators from two-and four-year colleges across the Southwestern and Southeastern United States who attended one of two National Science Foundation–sponsored workshops. The artifact analysis illustrates how engineering educators at HSIs recognized particular assets to leverage when innovating within their courses and de-partments, both from within and outside of their institutions. At the same time, these educators also acknowledged barriers to innovation from various sources, including personal, interpersonal, and administrative. Recognizing that faculty experiences can vary based on their position’s responsibili-ties, this study also begins to explore the differences in perception of educational innovation across instructional and tenure-line faculty. These differences across faculty types suggest an opportunity to bring different perspectives and skillsets to educational innovation collaborations that include faculty from diverse backgrounds and roles. Overall, this study provides a foundation for future research on factors impacting faculty engagement with inclusive and learner-centered pedagogy at institutions seeking to serve Latinx and other racially and ethnically diverse students.",Kendall M.; Strong A.; Henderson G.; Basalo I.,Journal,Journal of Women and Minorities in Science and Engineering,2021-01-01,University of Miami;Florida International University;The University of Texas at El Paso,Curriculum design ;  Design thinking ;  Engineering education ;  Faculty development ;  Hispanic-Serving Institutions ;  Institutional transformation ;  Instructional role
Designing Sustainable Futures: Interdisciplinary Science and Social Creativity,"In every region and every nation in the world, people face the difficult challenges of learning to design and maintain healthy societies with limited natural resources—including water, land, and energy—under rapidly changing global to local conditions. These challenges are contained within the framework of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030. Responding to the challenges of the SDGs at local to global scales must address the fundamental complexity of social–ecological systems. This requires understanding the technical, ecological, and geological conditions at multiple scales of time and space and equally importantly, understanding and designing for the future in the appropriate social, political, economic, and cultural contexts. In this talk, I want to discuss two critical questions that arise from these complex systems challenges: (1) How can we build the capacity to innovate for societal well-being by learning to think and act across traditional disciplinary lines? (2) How can we enhance the value of technology and engineering by engaging the knowledge, creativity, and cooperation of all parts of society in designing for their future?",Chabay I.,Book Series,Springer Water,2021-01-01,Research Institute for Sustainability – Helmholtz Centre Potsdam (RIFS);Arizona State University,Complex system science ;  Innovation for societal well-being ;  Inquiry and experiential learning ;  Interdisciplinary research ;  Resource governance ;  Transdisciplinary research
Learning from metabolism: Toward metabolic conservation,"In Japan during the 1960s, rapid economic growth began alongside preparations for the Olympics. At this time, Kenzo Tange and his academic research team at the University of Tokyo announced the “1960 Tokyo Plan,” which used scientific surveys and analysis to lay out a roadmap for the future of Tokyo. It was a strong message that denied political and economic post-war turmoil in Japan. Tange also designed the Yoyogi Gymnasium as well as other marvelous buildings, such as the St. Mary Catholic Cathedral in 1964, which utilized new technological innovations in engineering. Recently, several modern buildings have already been demolished or face precarious situations. However, the biological concepts of Metabolism Movement can allow such buildings to change and adapt, much like a living creature. This paper focuses on Metabolism architecture in Japan. In particular, the paper examines the Nakagin Capsule Tower Building (1972) designed by Kisho Kurokawa (1934-2007), which is an unsuccessful yet promising example of the conservation of modern architecture and an attempt to reposition Metabolism architecture within the history of modern architecture as an architectural movement integrating past and future, nature and architecture. This paper also illuminates the problems facing the conservation of modern architecture in general, and suggests a new direction for conservation and preservation processes based on the concept of ""Metabolic Conservation"".",Watanabe K.,Conference Proceeding,Inheritable Resilience: Sharing Values of Global Modernities - 16th International Docomomo Conference Tokyo Japan 2020+1 Proceedings,2021-01-01,Tokai University,

Towards Using Sensors as Data Sources in Teaching: Requirements for School Curricula-Compatible Sensors,"The continuous innovation in modern technologies in various sectors of society has transformed everyday life. It becomes imperative for the educational community to equip the future generation with digital skills. In this article, using qualitative and quantitative research techniques, we define criteria for school curricula-compatible sensors (particularly, for secondary school students in grades 5 through 9). We also develop requirements models for sensor classes that satisfy the school curricula compatibility criteria using requirements engineering techniques. The results show that integrating sensors into schools can improve students’ digital and data skills. Additionally, requirements models can help in developing school curricula-compatible sensors or transforming existing sensors into curricula-compatible sensors.",Saddiqa M.; Kirikova M.; Magnussen R.; Larsen B.; Pedersen J.,Journal,Complex Systems Informatics and Modeling Quarterly,2021-01-01,Riga Technical University;Aalborg University,Data Skills Requirements for Physical Systems ;  Digital Skills ;  School Education ;  Sensors ;  Technology Requirements
3d printed models to enhance engineering student engagement and learning,"Engineering students require strong skills in problem-solving, communication, research and presentation. Traditional strategies to teach 3D modelling by conventional orthogonal 2D drawings are not particularly effective to guide students in their development of spatial knowledge. Students benefit from an innovative engagement approach to connecting engineering theories to industry practice through handling and manipulating the all-round spatial views of 3D printed models, a student confidence-building approach. A new student engagement framework for student learning is presented in this article using the students and peers' reactions obtained from various sources, including the on-line evaluations through Central Queensland University's Student Experience Survey (SES). The impact of this framework in student motivation, engagement and curiosity in learning is assessed. The student satisfaction data obtained from a structural mechanics unit were low initially. With the introduction of innovative student engagement initiatives using 3D printed models, the structural mechanics unit's student satisfaction quickly improved. Both qualitative and quantitative student data are used to triangulate student learning and satisfaction. This enhances not only novel teaching innovations and evaluation, but also stimulates the interest of readers outside the context where the work is produced.",Mandal N.,Journal,Global Journal of Engineering Education,2021-01-01,CQUniversity Australia,Engagement strategy ;  Student motivation in learning ;  Student satisfaction ;  Teaching practices

Is CRM ready for industry 4.0? A historical technological framework,"The 4th Industrial Revolution, sometimes known as Industry 4.0, has disrupted the business and technology landscapes. Industry practitioners remain under pressure to adopt these innovations for competitive advantage. Enterprise systems (ES), such as customer relationship management (CRM) systems, are not exempt from these pressures, and indeed CRM may be at the forefront of company investments. Although CRM systems have been studied substantially, we did not find a summative framework integrating CRM innovations with their enabling technologies. We developed this framework by searching the academic literature on CRM, industrial revolutions, and technology innovation, juxtaposing the various phases of CRM evolution within the technical landscape that precipitated them. We identified a lag between the inception of technologies and their adoption within CRM systems. The purpose of this paper is to provide a technological perspective of CRM's history and state of the art, and its readiness to capitalize on Industry 4.0 innovations.",Kinnett S.; Steinbach T.,Conference Proceeding,"27th Annual Americas Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS 2021",2021-01-01,DePaul University,4  industrial revolution th ;  CRM ;  Customer relationship management ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Sales technology ;  Technology innovation ;  Web technologies

Applying Deep Learning Technologies to Evaluate the Patent Quality with the Collaborative Training,"As the country vigorously promotes the development of science and technology and tries to enhance independent innovation capabilities, more and more attention is paid on the protection of technology ownership. In recent years, China has developed rapidly in many scientific and technological fields, and the number of patent applications increased year by year. However, various patent quality problems including immature patent technology and low patent authorization rate appear. The indicators of patent quantification and quality evaluation are studied in this paper. First, we quantify the patent quality evaluation indicators and combine the content of the patent text to build a patent evaluation model. US patents with patent grade labels are used for training with multitask learning technology. Second, the evaluation model is transferred from the English patents to the Chinese patents, in which the active learning technology and transfer learning technology are used to minimize the work of manual labeling. Finally, a Chinese patent quality evaluation model based on collaborative training was designed and implemented. Methods used in this experiment have notably improved the prediction effect of the model and achieved a better migration effect. A large number of experimental results show that the Chinese patent quality evaluation model has achieved good evaluation results. This research uses deep learning and natural language processing technology to carry out research on patent quality evaluation models from different perspectives, to provide patent decision support for related companies, and to point out research directions for research institutions and patent inventors.",You X.; Liu J.; Wang Z.; Liu Z.; Lv X.; Kim J.,Journal,Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,2021-01-01,Gachon University;Beijing Information Science & Technology University,

Research on the Realization Path of College English Education Based on the SVM Algorithm Model under the Background of Cloud Computing and Wireless Communication,"The rapid development of cloud computing and wireless communication technology has brought a huge impact to traditional education methods, especially for college English education where the teaching mode is relatively simple and the impact is more than other disciplines. How to make full use of this information technology revolution and make it an opportunity for us to innovate in English education has become a topic that many scholars are paying attention to. Research on teaching innovation in the context of cloud computing and wireless communication has yielded fruitful results. This research wants to fully absorb the valuable experience of these research results, through the establishment of an optimized SVM algorithm model, and then conduct an online questionnaire survey of English majors in colleges and universities in Zhejiang Province in the form of a questionnaire survey. The design of the questionnaire mainly includes the following aspects: students' satisfaction with English education in the context of cloud computing and wireless communication, their own comprehensive English ability, and teacher's teaching ability. According to the data obtained from the questionnaire survey, combined with the SVM algorithm model for analysis, so as to optimize English teaching, the research results show that, in the context of cloud computing and wireless communication, college students are generally low in satisfaction with traditional English classroom teaching, but have a higher interest in the teaching innovation of cloud computing and wireless communication technology.

Implementation and evaluation of team science training for interdisciplinary teams in an engineering design program,"Introduction: Interdisciplinary academic teams perform better when competent in teamwork; however, there is a lack of best practices of how to introduce and facilitate the development of effective learning and functioning within these teams in academic environments. Methods: To close this gap, we tailored, implemented, and evaluated team science training in the year-long Engineering Innovation in Health (EIH) program at the University of Washington (UW), a project-based course in which engineering students across several disciplines partner with health professionals to develop technical solutions to clinical and translational health challenges. EIH faculty from the UW College of Engineering and the Institute of Translational Health Sciences’ (ITHS) Team Science Core codeveloped and delivered team science training sessions and evaluated their impact with biannual surveys. A student cohort was surveyed prior to the implementation of the team science trainings, which served as a baseline. Results: Survey responses were compared within and between both cohorts (approximately 55 students each Fall Quarter and 30 students each Spring Quarter). Statistically significant improvements in measures of self-efficacy and interpersonal team climate (i.e., psychological safety) were observed within and between teams. Conclusions: Tailored team science training provided to student-professional teams resulted in measurable improvements in self-efficacy and interpersonal climate both of which are crucial for teamwork and intellectual risk taking. Future research is needed to determine long-term impacts of course participation on individual and team outcomes (e.g., patents, start-ups).

Paris agreement on climate change as a driver to accelerate energy transition : measures to adapt the coal sector to ne w challenges,"Plakitkin Yu.?., Doctor of Economic Sciences, Professor, academician of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences, academician of Academy Mining Sciences, Head of Center for analysis and innovation in energy, e-mail: uplak@mail.ru Plakitkina L.S., PhD (Engineering), Corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences, Head of Center a research of World and Russian coal industry, e-mail: luplak@rambler.ru Abstract The Paris Agreement on Climate Change envisages that all Parties will re? duce their CO2 emissions by 2030 by 25-40% of the 2005 levels, and by 2050 by 70% through the decarbonisation of economies and application of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). The Russian Federation has made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 70% by 2030 (compared to the 1990 level) with account for maximum carbon sequestra? tion capacity of forests and other ecosystems. The mitigation costs may range from 40 to 80 EUR /tCO2 eq. The trend of increasing power density of applied energy sources revealed by the authors confirms that consistent use of traditional resources (firewood, coal, oil, gas) in the global energy sector leads to an increase in the average caloric equivalent. Measures and proposals on adaptation of the coal industry to the new conditions of the world economic development are presented in the article. Among these measures, a particular attention should be paid to the preparation of a new Coal Strategy-2050, which would include the development of a ""stress scenario"" of a possible reduction in coal consumption due to the decarbonisation of the global economy by 2050 and the implementation of hydrogen energy programmes by many countries.",Plakitkin Y.; Plakitkina L.,Journal,Ugol,2021-01-01,The Energy Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences,Calo rific equivalent ;  Carbon border adjustment ;  Carbon footprint ;  Carbon neutrality ;  Decarbonisation of economy ;  Hydrogen energy programme ;  Industry 4.0 global project ;  Measures for implementation of the second coal industry restructuring programme ;  Paris agreement on climate cnahge ;  Power density of applied energy sources ;  Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions ;  Regularities in global energy development ;  Technology leap

Modelling and visualizing knowledge on the reference system and variations based on the model of PGE - Product generation engineering for decision support,"In 2019, Dyson had to cancel its ambitious electric car project after having already 500 Million pounds spent. This example shows how difficult it is to assess the consequences of decisions on development targets as cost, risk, and innovation potential. Knowledge about references, variation types and their impact on development targets can help to increase the maturity of the decision basis. The model of PGE - product generation engineering describes these interrelations using the reference system. This contribution deals with the question of how knowledge about the impact of variation types and characteristics of reference system elements on new product generations can be made usable through modelling and visualization. Therefore, characteristics of reference system elements and their impacts on common development targets are collected through literature research. To process this knowledge base in technical information systems, an Entity-Relationship data model is developed. Through the implementation of a VR visualization, the data model is validated and a first visualisation approach is shown. The findings of this work can be used to systematise research on impact factors in PGE and to develop further digital methods.",Pfaff F.; Rapp S.; Albers A.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the Design Society,2021-01-01,Karlsruher Institut für Technologie,Design management ;  Design theory ;  Knowledge management

Application of a composite strengthening technique in steel bridge rehabilitation,"Aging of existing steel structures becomes a serious social and economic problem around the world, in both developing and developed countries where more and more structures become old and need to be strengthened or rebuilt. In comparison with replacement with new structures, maintenance or rehabilitation of existing structures have many advantages, such as relatively low cost in most cases, less disturbance on public traffic, less impact on the environment etc. In this paper, a research program for strengthening existing steel railway bridges is introduced. The design philosophy of the strengthening method, 7 loading tests (1 material test, 2 static tests on steel-concrete interface, and 4 laboratory and field tests on girder bridges, connections and columns) involved in this research and their brief summaries, were reported. The major aim of this paper is to report the research route, research methods and innovations of the research program, and provide a reference for engineering innovations in strengthening aged civil infrastructures.",Lin W.; Taniguchi N.; Yoda T.,Conference Proceeding,"Bridge Maintenance, Safety, Management, Life-Cycle Sustainability and Innovations - Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Bridge Maintenance, Safety and Management, IABMAS 2020",2021-01-01,Maebashi Institute of Technology;Aalto University;Waseda University,
The Virtual reality electrical substation field trip: Exploring student perceptions and cognitive learning,"COVID19 has disrupted many higher education’s learning experiences, including those related to work integrated learning. This included the cancelling of the annual electrical engineering field trip to a local electrical substation. Field trips provides students an opportunity to connect their classroom learning with industry relevant engaging experiences. While virtual reality (VR) alternatives to electrical substations have been implemented and researched, the focus has been on the innovation and not on the educational benefits. The impact on learning is not well documented and understood. To address this gap an experimental study is conducted on fifty electrical engineering students at the University of Wollongong to determine if a VR replica of an electrical substation can provide an equal or better learning and student experience compared to traditional methods. A successful finding would provide confidence to implement such alternatives for situations that include: addressing COVID disruptions; for students that miss the field trip; and for providers that don’t have the funds or resources to visit a substation. It was found that the VR substation simulation provided a comparable student experience and stronger cognitive learning benefits than traditional methods. Further research is needed to explore learning impact beyond the cognitive domain.",Memik E.; Nikolic S.,Journal,STEM Education,2021-01-01,University of Wollongong,electrical substation ;  field trip ;  Oculus Rift ;  unity ;  virtual reality
Behavioral Analysis of Subjects for Green Technology Innovation: A Tripartite Evolutionary Game Model,"The application of green technologies can reduce environmental hazards and promote sustainability. The connotation of green technology innovation has two main aspects: the first aspect is the generation of green technology from nothing to something, and the other aspect is the improvement and upgrading of existing green technology; these two aspects are related. However, from the existing research, there are relatively few studies on the process of green technology innovation from these two aspects at the same time. If green technology is not studied from this perspective, the evolutionary process and influencing factors of green technology from generation to development cannot be clarified, which is not conducive to the development of green technology and the realization of the goal of environmental friendliness. Research considers the green innovation process from R&D to upgrading linkages and analyses the roles of government departments, green technology R&D institutions, and green technology application enterprises in green technology innovation. In addition, the green technology application enterprises are considered to promote technology enhancement through technology application feedback with green technology R&D institutions. The evolutionary game model of three subjects was established, the strategic evolution process of different subjects was analyzed, the influence of each element on the strategic choice of different subjects was explored, and the stability analysis of strategic choice was conducted using simulation software. The study shows the following: (1) The greater the government's punishment and support to green technology R&D institutions, the more favorable it is for green technology R&D institutions to carry out green technology R&D. (2) In green technology applications, if the government has no direct interest relationship with green technology application enterprises, the enterprises will choose negative response behavior. (3) The greater the technology enhancement gains of green technology R&D institutions and the greater the feedback gains of technology applications actively carried out by enterprises in response to the government's call, the more the government departments tend to support green technology R&D.",Guo Y.; Zou H.; Liu Z.,Journal,Mathematical Problems in Engineering,2021-01-01,Shenyang University of Technology;Shenyang Normal University,
Designing education applications for generation Z,"This paper discusses how generational differences impact on innovation processes and application design in Higher Education institutions. With both pedagogies and technologies varyingly according to generational divides, the existing literature is examined to uncover what this means for gathering requirements and designing and building educational software. The Covid-19 pandemic has made the limitations of current teaching practices through technology ever more apparent, and this paper recommends that to provide the best learning experience for students, generational research and horizon scanning for upcoming technologies should both be applied to the innovation process carried out by universities.",Ashcroft A.,Conference Proceeding,"15th International Conference on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction, IHCI 2021 and 14th International Conference on Game and Entertainment Technologies, GET 2021 - Held at the 15th Multi-Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems, MCCSIS 2021",2021-01-01,"School of Computing and Communications, Lancaster University",Design ;  Gen-Z ;  Generations ;  Higher Education ;  Pedagogies ;  User Experience
"Remote, simulation or traditional engineering teaching laboratory: a systematic literature review of assessment implementations to measure student achievement or learning","The laboratory is an integral component of engineering education, resulting in a multitude of studies. Generally, the research focus is on the laboratory innovation, rather than learning itself. It is observed that empirical evidence is strongly built around student perceptions of their learning or experience via survey instruments; and in some cases, complimented with limited quantitative measures including assessments. With the laboratory being a multifaceted, multi-domain learning environment also covering the psychomotor and affective domains, such observations suggest that the empirical data being collected is providing an incomplete analysis. Therefore, this paper undertakes a systematic literature review exploring remote, simulation and traditional laboratory studies that explicitly include assessment analysis. Explored are the types of assessments used and assessment innovations. The study 1) confirms that assessments concentrate on the cognitive domain, underselling the learning being achieved; 2) Student survey instruments play an important role in measuring laboratory success; 3) Background information of the learning objectives are not clearly stated and/or not clearly linked to the associated assessment; 4) There are several research opportunities available to improve understanding of laboratory assessments. A roadmap and recommendations to overcome these weaknesses is outlined, providing a platform for future researchers to incorporate in their studies.",Nikolic S.; Ros M.; Jovanovic K.; Stanisavljevic Z.,Journal,European Journal of Engineering Education,2021-01-01,School of Electrical Engineering;University of Wollongong,Blooms taxonomy ;  laboratory learning assessment ;  learning objectives ;  systematic review

Social Entrepreneurship Business Models for Handicapped People—Polish & Turkish Case Study of Sharing Public Goods by Doing Business,"Entrepreneurship is a complex issue, having an interdisciplinary character, which definitely constitutes a set of personality traits expressed in the entrepreneur’s attitude. This background is the basis for reflection and an to take an attempt to present the definition of entrepreneurship, which multitude in the literature review exists as the scientific subject. Hence, the aspect of conducted research is individual conditions and direct interviews, allowing to describe the social-economic environment in which current and potential business owners grow. Almost 300 years have passed since the publication of R. Cantillon’s theory lead economy to the creation of works in the field of social entrepreneurship. The entrepreneurship manifestations described by specific examples—coming from the commercial market—made it possible to put forward the thesis that all symptoms are a consequence of achieved profits, or are a derivative of the “road to success”, whose main motive is the desire to make a profit. The issue of entrepreneurship, however, takes on a different connotation when one additional feature of the entrepreneur is added under consideration: his physical disability. Then, social commitment, passion, openness and empathy take on new connotations, from which once again one feature that determines the whole process cannot be selected, only their team. It should be agreed, however, that these processes will seriously imply innovations, which are the “key” to more effective, lasting and with consequences solutions. The projects were carried out separately in Poland and Turkey. Social entrepreneurship described in accordance with the Nshareplatform (NSP) was created for people with physical disabilities in order to create better living conditions and integration with society as active individuals in a dynamically changing economic environment. A support system has been created that enables both networking and reaping benefits for able people who can support disabled people by achieving their goals. The Turkish experience was based on the Liberated Social Entrepreneur and Migport project, which meet the needs of many migrants in Turkey, improving their living conditions, activating socially needed activity, which in turn affects social peace in a country that is burdened with many risks—including political, belonging to the range of basic determinants limiting the economic development of this country.",Czerkawski D.; Małecka J.; Weber G.; Kjamili B.,Conference Proceeding,Springer Proceedings in Mathematics and Statistics,2021-01-01,Politechnika Poznanska;Middle East Technical University (METU),Business modeling ;  Handicapped people ;  Public goods ;  Social entrepreneurship ;  Social impact
Research on Performance Prediction of Technological Innovation Enterprises Based on Deep Learning,"High-tech enterprises are the leaders in promoting economic development. The study of the relationship between their scientific and technological innovation capabilities and corporate performance is of far-reaching practical significance for guiding companies to formulate independent innovation strategies scientifically, improving their independent innovation capabilities, and promoting further transformation into an innovative country. In view of the large-scale technological innovation enterprise network, the traditional technological innovation enterprise performance prediction method cannot fully reflect the real-time technological innovation enterprise status. Aiming at the deficiencies of the existing short-term technology innovation enterprise forecasting methods, this paper proposes a technology innovation enterprise performance forecasting method based on deep learning. I analyze the temporal and spatial characteristics of the data of technological innovation enterprises and divide the data according to the temporal characteristics of technological innovation enterprises. According to the spatial relevance of technological innovation enterprises, grouping is carried out by setting different correlation coefficient thresholds. The method of spectral decomposition is used to divide the data of scientific and technological innovation enterprises into trend items and random fluctuation items, to decompose the matrix of scientific and technological innovation enterprises, and to construct a compressed matrix using correlation. Using the deep belief network model in deep learning combined with support vector regression to establish a prediction model for technological innovation enterprises, this paper proposes a convolutional neural network model for performance prediction of scientific and technological innovation enterprises. Through the convolution operation and subsampling operation based on the concept of local window, the feature learning from the local to the whole is completed. This article uses the Naive Bayes model, logistic regression model, support vector regression model, and other mainstream methods to predict and compare the performance of technological innovation enterprises. I use the dropout method to reduce the impact of overfitting during training. The experimental results show that the deep neural network model method used in this article can achieve better prediction results than mainstream methods under the same characteristics. The experimental results on the data set confirm that the method of performance prediction of technology innovation enterprises based on deep learning used in this paper can effectively improve the results of performance prediction of technology innovation enterprises.",Liu H.,Journal,Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,2021-01-01,Northwest University,

Construction of a Hierarchical Neural Network Power Source Model for Human Capital Technology Innovation and Benefit Distribution with Big Data Analysis,"In this paper, a hierarchical neural network power source model is used to conduct an in-depth analysis and research on human capital technology innovation and revenue distribution. A hierarchical neural network analysis method was chosen to evaluate the human capital value of professional degree master students, and the applicability of the index system was confirmed through errors; moreover, the significance of the output results was analyzed according to the weight assignments of the input, implicit, and output layers. The analysis found that there was a large disagreement in the assessment of their human capital value, which led to the lack of practical utility of human capital. Knowledge-skilled talents have a wealth of theoretical knowledge and can use theories to guide related work. Compared with technically skilled high-skilled talents, their educational level is higher, and they can summarize past intuitive experience into theoretical guidance. Therefore, the hierarchical neural network method we constructed is theoretically effective in assessing the value of the human capital of professional master's students and the role of the main constituents. Based on the assessment results, we can provide policy-informed suggestions for improving the quality of school education. To quickly verify whether the model can converge during the training process, a simple dataset with only two sequences and the elements in the sequences being real numbers rather than vectors are constructed to speed up the computation; meanwhile, the length of the sequences in this dataset is adjustable to initially verify the model's ability to alleviate the long-time dependence problem.",Liu Y.; Tsai S.,Journal,Mathematical Problems in Engineering,2021-01-01,Harbin University of Science and Technology;Wuyi University,

Nature-Inspired Principles for Sustainable Process Design in Chemical Engineering,"Sustainable chemical processes should be designed to combine the technological advantages and progress with lower safety risks and minimization of environmental impact such as, for example, reduction of raw materials, energy and water consumption, and avoidance of hazardous waste and pollution with toxic chemical agents. A number of novel eco-friendly chemical technologies have been developed in the recent decades with the help of the eco-innovations approaches and methods such as Life Cycle Analysis, Green Process Engineering, Process Intensification, Process Design for Sustainability, and others. An emerging approach to the sustainable process design in process engineering builds on the innovative solutions inspired from nature. However, the implementation of the eco-friendly technologies often faces secondary ecological problems. The study postulates that the eco-inventive principles identified in natural systems allow to avoid secondary eco-problems and proposes to apply these principles for sustainable design in chemical process engineering. The research work critically examines how this approach differs from the biomimetics, as it is commonly used for copying natural systems. The application of nature-inspired eco-design principles is illustrated with an example of a sustainable technology for extraction of nickel from pyrophyllite.",Mas’udah.; Santosa S.; Livotov P.; Chandra Sekaran A.; Rubianto L.,Book Series,IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2021-01-01,"State Polytechnic of Malang;SSN College of Engineering, Kalavakkam;University of Applied Sciences Offenburg",Biomimetics ;  Chemical engineering ;  Eco-inventive principles ;  Nature-inspired principles ;  Process design ;  Sustainable technology
Domain Analysis with TRIZ to Define an Effective “Design for Excellence” Framework,"Design for Excellence (DfEx) is the name given to an engineering process where a product is designed to meet a set of objective functions that cover its lifecycle. There are negative correlations between different objective functions in this set and issues related to technological complexity are added, since modern products typically fall into the category of smart connected mechatronic products. This context leads to complexity in terms of tackling the design process. Simultaneous engineering and PLM platforms can only partially handle such levels of complexity. To our knowledge, the subject of DfEx was treated in current researches from a limited perspective, which does not necessarily cover the complexity of the present-day context. In order to formulate a reliable DfEx framework, this research considers a strategy based on tools that manage in a systematic way the process of identifying the comprehensive set of barriers and conflicts that obstruct DfEx. This research highlights the level of complexity in setting up a reliable methodology to DfEx of modern, sophisticated mechatronic products. A set of guidelines to be placed at the foundation of an effective DfEx methodology is formulated with the support of TRIZ.",Brad S.,Book Series,IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2021-01-01,Universitatea Tehnica din Cluj-Napoca;Cluj IT Cluster,AFD ;  Design for excellence ;  Design methodology ;  DfX ;  Open innovation ;  Systematic innovation ;  TRIZ

Scalable Learning Environments for Teaching Cybersecurity Hands-on,"This Innovative Practice full paper describes a technical innovation for scalable teaching of cybersecurity hands-on classes using interactive learning environments. Hands-on experience significantly improves the practical skills of learners. However, the preparation and delivery of hands-on classes usually do not scale. Teaching even small groups of students requires a substantial effort to prepare the class environment and practical assignments. Further issues are associated with teaching large classes, providing feedback, and analyzing learning gains. We present our research effort and practical experience in designing and using learning environments that scale up hands-on cybersecurity classes. The environments support virtual networks with full-fledged operating systems and devices that emulate realworld systems. The classes are organized as simultaneous training sessions with cybersecurity assignments and learners' assessment. For big classes, with the goal of developing learners' skills and providing formative assessment, we run the environment locally, either in a computer lab or at learners' own desktops or laptops. For classes that exercise the developed skills and feature summative assessment, we use an on-premises cloud environment. Our approach is unique in supporting both types of deployment. The environment is described as code using open and standard formats, defining individual hosts and their networking, configuration of the hosts, and tasks that the students have to solve. The environment can be repeatedly created for different classes on a massive scale or for each student on-demand. Moreover, the approach enables learning analytics and educational data mining of learners' interactions with the environment. These analyses inform the instructor about the student's progress during the class and enable the learner to reflect on a finished training. Thanks to this, we can improve the student class experience and motivation for further learning. Using the presented environments KYPO Cyber Range Platform and Cyber Sandbox Creator, we delivered the classes on-site or remotely for various target groups of learners (K-12, university students, and professional learners). The learners value the realistic nature of the environments that enable exercising theoretical concepts and tools. The instructors value time-efficiency when preparing and deploying the hands-on activities. Engineering and computing educators can freely use our software, which we have released under an open-source license. We also provide detailed documentation and exemplary hands-on training to help other educators adopt our teaching innovations and enable sharing of reusable components within the community.",Vykopal J.; Celeda P.; Seda P.; Svabensky V.; Tovarnak D.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2021-01-01,Masaryk University,cyber range ;  cybersecurity education ;  educational data mining ;  interactive learning environment ;  learning analytics ;  learning technology ;  sandbox ;  virtual machines
Exploration and Practice for the Cultivation Mode of College Students’ Innovation Ability,"Science and technology innovation has become a major driving force for economic growth and social development. Engineers are the primary group that carry out technology innovation in industrial production. And universities are the major institutions for cultivating engineers. However, with the rapid updating of technology, engineering education in universities failed to cope with the actual requirements of enterprises. In order to bridge the gap between university education and industry’s demands for talents, an innovating engineer education center is proposed in this paper. It was jointly developed by universities and enterprises. In the innovating center, enterprises were incorporated into universities’ teaching systems. The longevity of university-enterprise co- operation was guaranteed in terms of funding, personnel and supervision. It shows that through the joint training of university and enterprises, students’ engineering ability of collaborative development for on-the-ground projects is significantly strengthened.",Xi Y.; Chen X.; Li Y.,Book Series,Communications in Computer and Information Science,2021-01-01,Beijing Institute of Technology;China North Industries Corporation,Engineering education ;  Innovation ;  University

Diffusion of innovation in an Australian engineering school,"Innovation in higher education is challenging as staff are often overloaded and highly independent. The rollout of new initiatives in higher education is difficult. This paper explores a successful innovation in higher education: the rollout of new staff training methods as part of a new learning management system (LMS) in an engineering school. The research question explored was whether diffusion of innovation theory offers a successful project structure for innovation in higher education. The measures used in this research were LMS logins in engineering compared to the whole university and feedback from the target group towards the beginning and end of the training. The findings are: (a) diffusion of innovation theory is a useful guide to innovate in higher education (b) a community of practice can play a key role in innovation in education. We conclude that key elements of a successful innovation include: (1) senior management support, (2) the time needed to change practices, (3) appropriate skill development, (4) contextualised innovation, (5) supportive networks, (6) a solid institutional infrastructure.",Currie G.; Henderson A.; Hoult R.,Journal,Australasian Journal of Engineering Education,2021-01-01,Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology,Academic staff ;  change ;  communities of practice ;  diffusion of innovation
Life-cycle stability management for passenger ships,"Stability has been a primary focus of the maritime industry and of immense interest to the IMO from the outset. Despite several attempts to resolve stability-related issues, the problem of stability remains one that has yet to be resolved. Reasons for this, range from the complexity of the problem itself to misconceptions in its very nature, particularly concerning compromised conditions of the ship in question. More specifically, whilst stability of ships is an extremely interesting scientific problem and a determining factor in ship design, the impact on the operation of passenger ships, a matter of crucial importance from the dual point of view of safety and economics, has hardly ever received the attention it deserves. Currently, intact stability and damage stability share the same stage from a regulatory perspective and, consequently, they have equal impact on design and operation-related decisions, an example of which is the use of combined intact and damage stability GM limit curves (e.g. IACS Rec 110 Rev1). However, in line with goal-based regulations and standards, design and operational decisions should be risk-informed in which case, matters relating to damage stability are of higher concern, simply by virtue of the fact that damage stability is by far the greater risk contributor. In fact, for passenger ships (>500GT), the level of risk associated with intact stability is indiscernible in contrast to that of damage stability. More importantly, in the operational loading conditions of such vessels, damage stability is a more dominant constraint. Hence, such ships are designed based on damage stability considerations alone. However, since life-cycle risk management is still an active research subject, stability management is being addressed somewhat haphazardly by allowing for design GM margins, drawing from experience on the average deterioration of GM over the life-cycle of passenger ships. This is typically 1% to 2% per year on average, which leaves roughly 50% of ships on the wrong side of this averaging process and this, in turn, limits operation substantially with severe economic impact. This paper delves in this direction by drawing on current ship design and operational practice and presents an innovation with application to a large cruise ship to demonstrate how life-cycle damage stability management could be tackled in a structured and cost-effective manner.",Vassalos D.; Paterson D.; Boulougouris E.; Mauro F.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference,2021-01-01,University of Strathclyde,AREST technology ;  Damage stability ;  Life Cycle Management ;  Passenger ships ;  Very large cruise vessels
A Model to Integrate the BPM Life Cycle and the Design Thinking Process,"The current scenario has been pressuring companies to innovate in order to stand out in the market. Innovation is not just about products, but also about improving processes. In this sense, this research aimed to propose an integrated life cycle model for process improvement, inspired both on the Business Process Management and on Design Thinking, in order to lead to more effective and creative process improvements. To propose the life cycle model, a literature review on the subject was conducted, and grounded on this result an integrated model is proposed. The initial proposition was then reviewed and improved based on opinions from specialists in the field. Finally, a revised life cycle model consisting of seven stages is proposed, integrating the main stages of the Business Process Management life cycle and the Design Thinking process.",Vargas C.; da Fontoura Vieira J.; Soliman M.; Marcon É.; Marcon A.,Conference Proceeding,Springer Proceedings in Mathematics and Statistics,2021-01-01,Universidade Federal de Santa Maria;Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul;University of the Sinos Valley,Business process management ;  Design thinking ;  Life cycle model
Virtual Reality as a Tool for Education and Training in Intensive Care,"Background: The health care system and therefore also intensive care units are already facing great challenges and continuous changes. Apart from the demographic change and the rise in the need for care, the growing relevance of digitalization also plays a major role. Due to the increasing demand for high-tech medicine and the continuous progress in intensive care, not only innovations are needed to face the continuous changes, but also a specific education and training for nurses at an intensive care unit. Purpose: The study was designed to explore how virtual reality can be used as a training and education tool in the context of the increasing digitalization in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Methodology: Guideline-based expert interviews were conducted with virtual reality companies, directors of training centers in which special training for intensive care nursing is offered, and qualified specialists of intensive care units. Findings: The qualitative research shows that different scenarios in intensive care units can already be illustrated and simulated with virtual reality. These range from equipment training to a simulation of an entire patient room with a virtual patient and different symptoms. Conclusion: Due to the already existing possibilities, virtual reality is recommendable and useful as a training and education tool in the field of intensive care and will be of great importance in the future.",Horwitz S.,Book Series,Communications in Computer and Information Science,2021-01-01,IMC Fachhochschule Krems GmbH,Development ;  Intensive care unit ;  Virtual nursing ;  Virtual reality ;  Virtual training
Balancing Exploration and Exploitation Through Open Innovation in the Automotive Domain – Focus on SMEs,"The automotive domain is one of Europe’s key drivers of innovation. This sector is undergoing a broad disruptive reorganisation. Competition is enticed by multiple emerging technologies, such as IoT. Thus, the industry is evolving at a swift pace. The need to continually reinvent and modernise organisations and their portfolios is not new. However, the speed at which this once so stable and established industry is changing presents unique challenges. The innovators’ dilemma rises from the paradox in which established organisations become victims of their success and become insignificant despite the boom of their established business. The impact of the research and development of new technologies is often not realised as organisations pour all resources into their current success model. This paper aims to provide suitable recommendations for implementing the organisational principle of ambidexterity in small and medium enterprises (SME) to better transfer and exploit the potentials of R&D projects or new technologies.",Macher G.; Veledar O.,Book Series,Communications in Computer and Information Science,2021-01-01,AVL List GmbH;Technische Universitat Graz,Ambidexterity ;  Automotive ;  Exploitation ;  Exploration ;  Open innovation
The Need of an Innovation Agent: Requirements and Competencies of the Human Dimension in Innovation Management,"The aim of this research is to introduce new competencies at the interface between corporate strategy and managing innovation in the automotive industry as strategic perspectives shift from a one-dimensional thinking in technology to a two-dimensional thinking in systems and business designs. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the trends in business designs and the way to get there. This requires an innovation agent with the competencies to translate the findings into suitable actions. We extend the principles of the SPI manifesto in the context of a learning organization, dynamic models, and focus. The question of how to strategically evaluate innovation projects of an automotive tier 1 supplier is addressed by the analysis of qualitative interviews in a single case organization. For this purpose, the model of the Innovation Landscape Map is used, which represents the initial situation of the innovation projects of a company on its technical competencies and the business model. This internal view is then extended by an external perspective of megatrends and external interviewees to counteract purely corporate thinking and provide a more holistic view. The results show gaps between the desired allocation and the actual allocation, as well as internal and external views. Finally, in a self-reflection it is determined which possible competencies are necessary for an innovation agent in the implementation of a new tool in innovation management.",Del Fabbro A.; Niklas A.; Peisl T.,Book Series,Communications in Computer and Information Science,2021-01-01,Hochschule München;Strategy Management;University of Applied Science Landshut,Applied research ;  Innovation ;  Innovation agent ;  Strategy
Linking Innovation and eLearning – The Case for an Embedded Design,"The need to link eLearning and innovation has been discussed in depth in education and entrepreneurship since its inception 30 years ago. In times of subscriptions and anonymous selling via the internet organisations have one need prior to adopting a product: they need to acquire the right skills to accept the innovation a new product brings them. There is significant research outlining how eLearning supports the increase of knowledge in general and especially in organisational product adoption which details both the positive and negative impacts and practicalities of eLearning and its use. This cross-industry multi-case approach in automotive, healthcare and other sectors investigates the status and the potential of eLearning in Big Tech. We present findings that suggest embedding all needed eLearning directly into products before or during product introduction. Short and immediate eLearning and usage of simulations to uniform processes is the solution to increase product adoption. This suggestion is not only changing the well-known product lifecycle model by integration eLearning into the product, as AI will be able to analyse the eLearning data and give valuable feedback for the future product and process improvements.",Ziegler A.; Peisl T.; Harte P.,Book Series,Communications in Computer and Information Science,2021-01-01,IBM Deutschland GmbH;Hochschule München;Edinburgh Napier University,Automotive ;  Cross-sector ;  eLearning ;  Embedding design ;  Innovation ;  Multi-case approach
"EmpoderaData: Sharing a successful work-placement data skills training model within Latin America, to develop capacity to deliver the SDGs","EmpoderaData - from the Spanish word empoderar 'to empower' - is a partnership research project between the University of Manchester (UK), Fundação Getulio Vargas (Brazil), Universidad del Rosario (Colombia) and Data-Pop Alliance (US and France). The project builds upon a successful data-driven, research-led paid internship programme in the UK (Q-Step) which enables undergraduate social science students to practise data skills through immersion in the workplace. Two-hundred and fifty students have benefited from the Q-Step programme in six years, many graduating into analytical careers in civic society and industry. EmpoderaData aims to build on this experiential learning initiative by developing a data fellowship programme in order to foster and develop data literacy skills in Latin America, led by the need to address society's most pressing issues and using the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). EmpoderaData Phase 1 explored whether the internship model would have relevance and usefulness within the context of three Latin American case study countries (Brazil, Colombia and Mexico). The team set out to establish a baseline of the state of data literacy and existing training programs in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. As part of a 'Big Data for the Common Good' event, a workshop was held in São Paulo with thirty participants representing data literacy advocacy or policy formation and drawn from civil society, academia, the private and public sector. The main conclusions from this first phase are: (1) the most requested data literacy training need is for basic skills, including introductory statistics, foundation data analysis and methodological skills; (2) paid data fellowship models are acknowledged as a useful intervention; and (3) the notion of a 'hybrid' professional to build data literacy capacities for 'social science' purposes provides a practical way forward. In the EmpoderaData Phase 2 project our focus was on Colombia to explore the challenges and opportunities of developing a pilot data fellowship model there. Engaging with national, regional and international capacity development efforts, this highlighted a demand for partnerships between universities and organisations working on the social challenges represented by the SDGs. Partnerships ensure that the in-country data literacy pipeline is strengthened in a home-grown, self-sustaining way, producing a steady flow of data literate graduates into the institutions and sectors where critical data skills are most needed. We report on how the EmpoderaData project is exploring working with students studying Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) degrees at the Universidad del Rosario, to improve the application of statistical methods to the social sciences. The aim is to strengthen STEM skills and develop youth empowerment across Colombia, urban and rural areas, to improve the quality of statistical education at the national level, and support the skills needed to deliver the SDGs. In parallel, the Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV) Business School in São Paulo agreed to trial the work-placement programme in their undergraduate business and public policy degrees through a programme entitled 'The FGV Q-Step Center to improve quantitative skills in undergraduate business students'. This two-year-long funded study will enable us to explore the transferability of the internship model from the UK to Brazil. The paper will discuss how the programme was established (following the lessons learned from EmpoderaData), explain how this model will be implemented in FGV, especially paying attention to how the curriculum will develop to support it, and how the impact of the programme will be monitored. The knowledge exchange generated from this study will complement the research conducted through the EmpoderaData project. The paper will cover the progress of the EmpoderaData project and FGV-Q-Step Center to date and explore how we are developing these initiatives, the challenges we have faced, and how through partnership working we are developing capacity building in statistical and data skills training.",Carter J.; Méndez-Romero R.; Jones P.; Higgins V.; Samartini A.,Journal,Statistical Journal of the IAOS,2021-01-01,Fundacao Getulio Vargas;Universidad del Rosario;The University of Manchester,data skills ;  educational innovation ;  internships ;  statistical literacy ;  Sustainable development goals
An interdisciplinary conceptual study of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for helping benefit-risk assessment practices,"We propose a comprehensive analysis of existing concepts of AI coming from different disciplines: Psychology and engineering tackle the notion of intelligence, while ethics and law intend to regulate AI innovations. The aim is to identify shared notions or discrepancies to consider for qualifying AI systems. Relevant concepts are integrated into a matrix intended to help defining more precisely when and how computing tools (programs or devices) may be qualified as AI while highlighting critical features to serve a specific technical, ethical and legal assessment of challenges in AI development. Some adaptations of existing notions of AI characteristics are proposed.

STEM and STEAM Education in Russian Education: Conceptual Framework,"The paper examines the STEM approach as one of the revolutionary tools for transforming education. This paper discloses the content of the concept of “STEAM-education”, substantiates its importance and prerequisites for its appearance. The author elucidates a comparative analytical review of trends and prospects for the development of STEAM education in the Russian Federation. In this paper, the authors want to touch upon a comprehensive theoretical and methodological study conducted on the declared problem to identify the problem of the formation and development of the STEAM approach in the education system in the Russian Federation at all levels: general education, vocational education, and additional education. The object of this study was STEM education. The subject of this research was the STEM approach and STEM technologies in the system of general education, vocational education, and additional education. The methodological foundation of the study was the general scientific propositions on the holistic, systemic, and dialectical approaches to research, which made it possible to assess the totality of interrelated and interacting elements that form a certain integrity. The use of these approaches provided a comprehensive analysis and formulation of the research problem and determined the strategy for its study. The analysis of the current state of STEM and STEAM education in higher education in the Russian Federation suggests that it is necessary to stimulate the development of information and communication technologies in the country's education system in general, as well as to develop comprehensive programs for adapting STEM and STEAM approaches among the subjects of educational relations. In the context of modern global risks and challenges, the educational trajectory of development in Russia should be conceptually consistent with the new strategy in the field of natural science education adopted in the United States, “The Path to Success: American Strategy for STEM Education”. Experts believe that through the practical implementation of STEM and STEAM technologies, it is possible to improve the efficiency of the quality of training for the purposes of the modern digital economic sphere. In this regard, the primary competences obtained in the higher education system in the areas of STEM and STEAM training should be cognitive, personal, and interpersonal competences, expressed in digital literacy, computational thinking, creativity, open mind, soft skills, and others. The concept of STEAM education in the system of higher professional education in Russia will ensure the transformation of ideas about scientific knowledge and build an innovative development process through the formation of skills in the field of exact sciences, linguistics, engineering, art, etc.",Shukshina L.; Gegel L.; Erofeeva M.; Levina I.; Chugaeva U.; Nikitin O.,Journal,"Eurasia Journal of Mathematics, Science and Technology Education",2021-01-01,Moscow University of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation named after V.Ya.

Research on the Influence of Industry-University-Research Cooperation Innovation Network Characteristics on Subject Innovation Performance,"The automobile industry serves as the primary industry for national development and also enhances manufacturing development strategies. Its source of power comes from the maturity and operational efficiency of the technology innovation network within the industry. Firstly, this paper takes the automobile industry of the Yangtze River Economic Belt as the research object and depicts the topological structure of the 1985-2015 Industry-University-Research Cooperation Innovation Network (IURCIN) from the perspective of space-time evolution. Then, based on the 2015 industrial network characteristic data, the paper analyses the impact of individual network characteristics such as intermediate centrality, structural hole limitation, and cooperation intensity on the innovation performance of the respective network. At the same time, it adds innovation activity, per capita gross regional product (GRP), and research and development (RD) fund input intensity as control variables in the quantitative analysis. The results show that the centrality and structural hole limitation significantly and positively affect the subject innovation performance. The cooperation intensity and the subject innovation performance have an inverted U-shaped relationship. The innovation activity has a positive effect on the subject's innovation performance. Furthermore, per capita GRP and RD expenditure intensity on the main innovation performance is not significant. Finally, the countermeasures and suggestions are put forward to promote the innovation performance of each subject in the IURCIN.",Li M.; Zhang M.; Agyeman F.; Ud Din Khan H.,Journal,Mathematical Problems in Engineering,2021-01-01,Jiangsu University,
Intelligent computing application for cloud enhancing healthcare services,"Intelligent computing is a novel means of delivering computing services and resources. Due to massive demand of healthcare services that are transforming the face of health information systems (HISs), investing in healthcare research becomes more fundamental. Nonetheless, just like any form of healthcare advancement, intelligent computing needs to be investigated and evaluated before health practitioners decide to apply it globally. The application of innovations as a result of intelligent computing can be one of the best means of transforming healthcare provisions especially during the process of sharing patient data between medical practitioners during the urgent actual-time cases. However, before initiating the complete transformation of the healthcare sector, there should be a specific strategy that requires thorough eval-uation. For instance, a feasible intelligent strategy that is applicable in the healthcare facility must use a public domain cloud infrastructure to permit public accessibility to fundamental engineering healthcare data during the process of retrieving medical resources.",Haldorai A.; Ramu A.,Book Series,Lecture Notes on Data Engineering and Communications Technologies,2021-01-01,Presidency University Bangalore;Sri Eshwar College of Engineering,Cloud infrastructure ;  Electronic health records (EHRs) ;  Health information systems (HISs) ;  Information technology ;  Intelligent computing
Myoelectric control of robotic leg prostheses and exoskeletons: A review,"Myoelectric signals from the human motor control system can improve the real-time control and neural-machine interface of robotic leg prostheses and exoskeletons for different locomotor activities (e.g., walking, sitting down, stair ascent, and nonrhythmic movements). Here we review the latest advances in myoelectric control designs and propose future directions for research and innovation. We review the different wearable sensor technologies, actuators, signal processing, and pattern recognition algorithms used for myoelectric locomotor control and intent recognition, with an emphasis on the hierarchical architectures of volitional control systems. Common mechanisms within the control architecture include 1) open-loop proportional control with fixed gains, 2) active-reactive control, 3) joint mechanical impedance control, 4) manual-tuning torque control, 5) adaptive control with varying gains, and 6) closed-loop servo actuator control. Based on our review, we recommend that future research consider using musculoskeletal modeling and machine learning algorithms to map myoelectric signals from surface electromyography (EMG) to actuator joint torques, thereby improving the automation and efficiency of next-generation EMG controllers and neural interfaces for robotic leg prostheses and exoskeletons. We also propose an example model-based adaptive impedance EMG controller including muscle and multibody system dynamics. Ongoing advances in the engineering design of myoelectric control systems have implications for both locomotor assistance and rehabilitation.",Nasr A.; Laschowski B.; McPhee J.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference,2021-01-01,University of Waterloo,
A framework to develop and evaluate circular economy readiness within the rail sector,"The circular economy (CE) has been a policy initiative for supply chain looping strategies to reuse, refurbish, recycle, minimise, eliminate, share, and optimise material and energy use while maintaining firm profitability. Nevertheless, it appears there is no unified reporting framework that defines how effective an organisation’s circular economy activity is. Furthermore, such a framework requires systems-wide thinking and co-ordinated action across business, government and society. Also, it appears there are no previous studies that have examined how an organisation’s CE effectiveness can be developed or measured specifically based upon Systems Theory. In particular, within the context of how an organisation designs itself, its products and services, such that it can continually adapt and remain viable and sustainable in the future. If organisations were concerned enough about their own viability in relation to the products and services they sell and the impact that they have on the environment, then their business strategies and plans would include evidence to continuously improving circular economic activity. If customers and Regulators understood how effective an organisation’s products and services were in having a reduced or minimised impact, or better still, had a regenerative effect on the environment then this would create visibility of CE competition and CE value against incentives. To create a CE competitive environment, the products and services that form part of that CE competition relies upon ‘thinking in systems’. Systems Thinking is the ability to understand and/or design non-linear interdependencies of feedback relationships in context. For example, within a CE context, designing things for their next use, design for disassembly, maintaining the residual value of raw materials, designing products as an asset instead of a liability (to the environment) and designing products of service. As this research is still a work in progress, this paper does not aim to present a conclusive approach or methodology; rather, it presents a progressive step towards the development of a CE readiness framework within the rail sector. The longer-term aim for the outcome of the research in future will be to form the basis to enable a common platform to determine levels of CE value/competition not only within the Rail sector but wider industry.",Waring C.; Liyanage K.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management,2021-01-01,University of Derby,Business Strategy ;  Circular Economy ;  Environment Strategy ;  Ethics in Engineering ;  Innovation ;  Problem Solving Methodologies ;  Sustainability ;  System thinking ;  Viable Systems Methodology (VSM)

Academic and professional relevance of physics: Comparing perceptions of engineering students from Mexico and Chile,"Research about the perception of engineering students regarding the relevance of physics could explain the factors that influence their learning and retention in the engineering curricula. In the present study, we investigate students' perceptions of physics' relevance by comparing results by country, student semester, and gender. This is a quantitative comparative study between engineering students from Mexico and Chile. A total of 1,323 engineering students enrolled in physics courses in two private universities from those countries in their first and third semester responded to an eleven-item 5-Likert scale-type statements survey. Results showed that students in their first semester perceive the importance of physics more positively than students in their third semester. In general, students in the Mexican university have higher perceptions of physics' importance in engineering than students in the Chilean institution. Male and female students have similar perceptions about the relevance of physics. However, female students have a slightly higher perception of physics' importance for their ongoing studies in engineering than their male peers in the Mexican institution, opposite to what the results show in the Chilean institution. Reflecting upon the results and discussion of this contribution, some recommendations are: redesign physics courses to include activities in which students are in contact with real-life situations in classes, emphasizing the engineering part of the problem; promote active learning strategies in which students participate in the construction of their learning by interdisciplinary and gender-perspective approaches; and, include the student perspective in the curriculum and teaching materials by involving the higher-year students to demonstrate the relevance of physics to their first-year peers. As students are aware and perceive the relevance of their learning, they will be able to apply their knowledge in different academic careers and professional life situations.",Quezada-Espinoza M.; Dominguez A.; Zavala G.,Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2021-01-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey;Universidad Andrés Bello;Escuela de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud TecSalud,Educational innovation ;  Gender influences on perceptions ;  Relevance of physics to engineering ;  Student perceptions
A methodology for embedding research competencies in an undergraduate civil engineering program,"Research and its relationship with undergraduate education plays a decisive role in the training of new engineering professionals with a greater affinity for basic and applied research as a fundamental tool in their professional performance and a pillar for lifelong learning (LL). The study aimed to improve the research competencies of civil engineering students from the Universidad de Lima. To achieve this goal, a methodology that allows the acquisition of them gradually, throughout the curriculum, has been developed. Didactic-methodological tools were introduced transversally using a gradual, incremental, and progressive process to promote and develop student research competencies. To follow up on how this process evolved, the acquisition status of research competencies among a group of students was monitored and followed up over four consecutive semesters for two years. The implementation mechanism was based on immersing the students in different types of research exercises depending on their semester by developing exploratory, descriptive, and experimental/predictive research activities. The results indicate that the proposed methodology, Gradual Implementation Research Competencies (GIRC) Program, improved students' acquisition level of research competencies. It was possible to standardize a methodology for the development, improvement and evaluation of students' research competencies, acquired through research exercises. The most representative products generated from the design and implementation of this methodology are: Research competencies proposal, a rubric to assess them, and the Matrix of the Gradual Implementation Research Competencies Program with the proficiency levels expected for each curriculum year.",DEL SAVIO A.; CÁCERES L.; GALANTINI K.,Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2021-01-01,Universidad de Lima,Civil engineering ;  Competencies ;  Innovation ;  Lifelong learning ;  Rubric ;  Undergraduate research
Experimental study on mechanical properties and microstructures of steel fiber-reinforced fly ash-metakaolin geopolymer-recycled concrete,"Geopolymer cementitious materials and recycled aggregate are typical representatives of material innovation research in the engineering field. In this study, we experimentally investigated a method to improve the performance of geopolymer-recycled aggregate concrete (GRAC). The recycled concrete aggregates and steel fiber (SF), fly ash (FA), metakaolin (MK), and sodium silicate solution were used as the main raw materials to prepare fiber-reinforced geopolymer-recycled aggregate concrete (FRGRAC). First, the orthogonal test was carried out to study the GRAC, and the optimal mix proportion was found. Second, building on the optimal mix proportion, the effects of the SF content on the slump, 7 and 28 days compressive strength, tensile strength, and flexural strength of FRGRAC were further studied. Finally, the microscopic mechanism of FRGRAC was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The study results indicate that the slump continues to decrease as the fiber content increases, but the compressive strength, tensile strength, and flexural strength increase to a certain extent. Through SEM analysis, it is found that SF restrains the development of cracks and improves the strength of concrete.",Xu Z.; Huang Z.; Liu C.; Deng X.; Hui D.; Deng Y.; Zhao M.; Qin L.,Journal,Reviews on Advanced Materials Science,2021-01-01,Chengdu University of Technology;Guangzhou University;University of New Orleans Dr. Robert A.

Circle fitting for improved GNSS positioning via smartphones for engineering purposes,"With access to the raw data collected by certain Android smartphones, it is possible to perform post-processing of the data. Thus, it is possible to employ certain satellite positioning methods that were previously restricted to geodetic receivers. Thanks to this and other innovations, such as the emergence of smartphones with modern GNSS sensors, a promising scenario is seen when employing these devices in engineering applications. Generally, in certain applications that require high accuracy, centimeter and millimeter order, geodetic receivers are used. However, these devices are expensive when compared to smartphones. In this research, the coordinates of a point were determined via a smartphone with a modern GNSS sensor, whose data were post-processed by the IBGE-PPP service, using the combination GPS+GLONASS and L1 frequency. Thus, using circle adjustment techniques based on least squares, it was possible to obtain horizontal accuracy of approximately 12 cm and 25 cm with a set of about 128-hour and 24-hour sessions respectively. The results obtained in this research suggest that the applied methodology can be used in certain applications in engineering, such as land surveying of rural properties.",Gomes A.; Klein I.; Krueger C.,Journal,Boletim de Ciencias Geodesicas,2021-01-01,"Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Santa Catarina;Universidade Federal do Parana",Adjustment ;  GNSS ;  IBGE-PPP ;  Least Squares ;  Smartphone
Project bundling in transportation construction,"Project bundling is a process through which a single contract is awarded for the continued development of multiple bridges or roadways, i.e., their preservation, rehabilitation, or replacement. One question that past studies on project bundling have not answered is that of how to quantify its benefits on engineering projects. This paper shows the extent to which project bundling enables optimal use of resources and promotes quicker project completion. It also explains how project bundling effectively leverages these efficiencies by simplifying project delivery and exploiting alternative and traditional contracting approaches. Indeed, because the process of bundling individual projects into larger “umbrella” contracts simplifies design, contracting, and construction, it enables organizations to leverage economies of scale for significantly increased efficiency. This process also encourages more partnering during project delivery, execution, and project completion. In addition to discussing the efficiency of bundling, this paper also identifies implementation strategies and scenarios for project bundling that can be applied by counties, municipalities, districts, or states. These implementation practices can also be layered to allow any combination of project types, beyond the combinations most common to current bundling contracts. Ultimately, this research shows that overall contract cost can be significantly reduced through carefully designed strategic project bundling.",D’Angelo D.; Minchin R.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of International Structural Engineering and Construction,2021-01-01,University of Florida;ARA Transportation Infrastructure,Coordinate ;  Every Day Count ;  Improve performance ;  Innovation

A Microservice-Based Reference Architecture for Digital Platforms in the Proteomics Domain,"Proteomics holds huge innovations for healthcare such as personalized medicine to tremendously increase people’s health. Due to its rapid growth, its multidimensional data sets and the related need for the latest technologies and huge computing capacities, a diverse and scattered tool and repository landscape evolved in an uncontrolled manner. Therefore, tool usage is complicated, time consuming and almost impossible without expert IT skills. To create the conditions for new innovations in the proteomics domain and making first steps towards personalized medicine, digital platforms are needed. However, designing such a system is complex and was not yet supported by information systems. Consequently, we will design and implement a sustainable microservice-based reference architecture for digital platforms in the proteomics domain based on the example of ProteomicsDB that focuses on maintainability, extendibility, and reusability by following the design science requirements. With our reference architecture, we extend evidence-based design knowledge in real-world information systems contributing to information systems research and provide proteomics researchers, but also practitioners a foundation for establishing new business models and enhancing existing or developing new services or platforms.",Shraideh M.; Samaras P.; Schreieck M.; Krcmar H.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2021-01-01,Technische Universität München,Design science ;  Digital platform ;  Information systems engineering ;  Microservices ;  Proteomics ;  Reference architecture
"Life cycle engineering: Past, present, and future","Engineering activities around the globe have been systematically directed towards the sustainability in last few years. Life cycle engineering (LCE) is a promising choice to achieve sustainability due to its long-term perspective and consideration of both economic and ecological targets. The concept of life cycle engineering was introduced in the 1908s to address the emerging concepts about sustainability in engineering. With the innovations in engineering and other related areas, a lot of tools have been developed to operationalize the life cycle engineering concept, but as the scope of sustainability in the many areas has broadened. Now Life cycle engineering is evolving in parallel with some other disciplines for different objectives and requirements. At present, life cycle engineering exists in many concepts such as cleaner production, industrial ecology, life cycle management, circular economy, and industrial symbiosis. It is still a challenge to develop an integrated framework for all these concepts. This book chapter aims to review the work done in 45 years (1975-2020) in life cycle engineering and develop an integrated framework for life cycle engineering. The systematic literature review approach is considered to review the work done in the life cycle engineering from 1975 to 2020. In this research work, the Scopus database is considered for data collection. Further, most common keywords, high impact factor journals and highly cited papers in the area of life cycle engineering have been considered and referred. This chapter also aims to introduce the new integrated framework for LCE which defines its boundaries and concepts. With the help of the bottom-up and top-down approach, the framework establishes the LCE concept. It is expected that this chapter will help the readers to understand the life cycle engineering and decide their research direction in this field.",Jamwal A.; Agrawal R.; Sharma M.,Book,Sustainable Manufacturing,2021-01-01,Malaviya National Institute of Technology Jaipur,Environment ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Life cycle engineering ;  Sustainability ;  Sustainable manufacturing
Project Management Competences for Next Engineers in the Industry 4.0 Era. A Case Study,"In the context of training in engineering and technology in the Industry 4.0 era, project competences’ acquisition must start from the trainer’s perspective as a counselor, facilitator, and sponsor of trainees’ learning. This means minimizing master classes to promote their autonomy and collaborative work, not being possible to ensure their development through traditional evaluations. In a recession context (Spain, Andalusia, and Cadiz) with low growth and high youth unemployment rate, it is intended to promote future engineers’ entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation. Within this framework, the study reviews the models that highlight the ways of teaching and learning in project management subjects in the engineering degrees of the industrial branch (chemistry, electricity, electronics, industrial design and product development, mechanics, and industrial technology) offered by the University of Cadiz (UCA). This selects project-based learning (PBL), in which learners are the main characters, who evolve through experimentation. This research consists of three stages. In a first phase, education in entrepreneurship is encouraged.

Formulating a Strategic Plan for BIM Diffusion within the AEC Italian Industry: The Application of Diffusion of Innovation Theory,"The importance of digital skills diffusion in fostering the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry has been highlighted for more than a decade. The extent to which this objective can be achieved depends on several factors. An augmented building information modelling (BIM) adoption stems from, but is not restricted to, government policies and initiatives. This study aims to assess the diffusion of digital skills, specifically through BIM adoption and to establish feasible strategies for such adoption within the Italian AEC industry,= taking into account institutional, organisational and project-related factors. This purpose is achieved through an initial investigation of the most significant hurdles in BIM uptake and various BIM-promoting policies adopted at an international level. Moreover, a rigorous review of recent developments in the diffusion of innovation theory is presented. Based on findings and combining the experiences of various authors in BIM-related research an exploratory online survey was conducted, resulting in identification of the clients' lack of knowledge as the most critical challenge to BIM adoption in the Italian AEC industry.

Preferred roles of industrial engineering and management students - An exploratory European analysis,"The European Students of Industrial Engineering and Management (ESTIEM) is a non-profit organization of Industrial Engineering and Management (IEM) students, founded in 1990 to promote the connection between students, companies, and professors by its activities and initiatives. Through its partnership with the European-funded “Professional Roles and Employability of Future EngineeRs” (PREFER) project, whose objective is to allow students to better understand what engineers do and what kind of engineers they want to be, ESTIEM started a research to better understand the preferred engineering roles of students in several universities in Europe. In the PREFER project, three professional roles for early career engineers - Product Leadership (focusing on radical innovation), Operational Excellence (focusing on process optimisation) and Customer Intimacy (focusing on tailored solutions) - have been identified. Furthermore, competencies essential to be successful in those roles have been associated with them. Based on this model, two tests for engineering students were developed including the PREFER Explore test, which identifies the preference of the engineering roles. Understanding the importance of knowing the competencies needed for future engineers, the goal of the research is to map the possible differences in regard to the preferred roles among IEM students in Europe. This paper reports the findings of the Explore test run among six universities in Europe that are members of the ESTIEM network (Lisbon, Porto, Liège, İstanbul-Boğaziçi, Eindhoven and Saint-Petersburg). From those, Bachelor and Master students in IEM were invited, regardless of their association with ESTIEM (n=179). Findings indicate that the roles preference vary inside each university, even though the population shares the same educational background, and throughout the different European universities analysed. Furthermore, it explores the potential factors influencing those preferences based on students’ insights and previous research conducted by ESTIEM.",Heyen V.; Serôdio M.; De Oliveira R.; Özdağ E.; Craps S.,Conference Proceeding,International Symposium on Project Approaches in Engineering Education,2021-01-01,Leuvens Centrum voor Onderwijs van Ingenieurs en Wetenschappers;ESTIEM,Engineering education ;  Engineering roles ;  Industrial engineering ;  Management
CDIO and biomimicry: A case of study of analysis of the enhanced structural masonry interlock with the nacre interlacing solution,"This article seeks to discuss possible contributions of addressing the environmental issue as an optional standard for the Conceive, Design, Implement and Operate - CDIO methodology. In turn, the environmental approach was based on Biomimetics in which models of nature serve as inspiration for the design of products and processes to solve human problems. In this article, the development of a students’ project of the civil engineering course carried out in an optional course at PUC-SP with the union of the methodologies of CDIO and Biomimicry will be detailed. The general objective of the optional course was to create a Biomimetic engineering solution: students should choose a problem to be worked on and, from that, they should seek inspiration in nature through analysis of morphological, physiological, anatomical characteristics of living beings or even in phenomena nature to develop the conception of your project. The project described here adopted as an object of study the improvement of the interlocking of structural masonry with the use inspired by Nacre: from the analysis of Nacre's morphology, the students sought to reproduce the interlocking characteristics of this material that would influence its resistance. Through the union of CDIO and Biomimetic methodologies, students had the possibility to develop research and prototyping skills, competences, hypothesis testing and product validation.

A Machine Learning Approach for Recognition of Elders’ Activities Using Passive Sensors,"The increasing ageing population around the world, is calling for technological innovations that can improve the lives of elderly people. Real time monitoring their activities is imperative in order to mitigate the detrimental occurrences and dangerous events like falls. The aim of this research is to develop and test a Machine Learning model, capable to determine the activity performed by the elderly in their everyday environment. Data for this research was acquired by setting up two fully monitored rooms, equipped with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) antennas, while subjects who participated in the experiment were wearing a Wearable Wireless Identification and Sensing Platform (W2ISP) tag. The dataset consisted of 14 healthy elders, who would perform four activities namely: sitting on the bed, sitting on a chair, lying in bed and ambulating. Nine independent variables were used, eight of which were obtained by the sensors as raw data vectors and the ninth is the gender. The final data set includes 75,128 records. Totally, 25 Classification Algorithms were used in an effort to determine the more efficient model. The best performance has been achieved by employing the Bagged Trees algorithm. A combination of 10-fold Cross validation and Grid Search was used in order to tune the values of the hyperparameters and to avoid any form of overfitting or underfitting. The accuracy and the generalization ability of the optimal model, have been proved by the high values of all performance indices, with a very small deviation for the case of the fourth activity. Thus, this approach can be reliably used (with low cost) by caregivers, hospital staff or anyone else in charge, to watch for potentially dangerous situations for the elders.",Psathas A.; Papaleonidas A.; Iliadis L.,Book Series,IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2021-01-01,Democritus University of Thrace,Bagged Trees ;  Elders’ activity recognition ;  Human activity recognition ;  Machine Learning ;  RFID ;  W ISP 2

The transition of regional innovation systems to Industry 4.0: the case of Basque Country and Catalonia,"The work looks at how regions design policies to facilitate the transition of regional innovation systems to Industry 4.0. The research analyses how regional Industry 4.0 policies should take into account the integration of the position of the regional productive system into international supply chains, the games of legitimacy and power of the actors involved in the innovation system, the institutional structures that allow the exchange of knowledge on Industry 4.0. between the agents and the connection between the synthetic knowledge base (engineering driven) and the analytical knowledge base (science driven) of the region. Through a detailed case study of the background, structure and impact of Industry 4.0 in the Spanish regions of the Basque Country and Catalonia, the work demonstrates how it is not possible to define a policy of promoting Industry 4.0 that is generalizable to all regions and how each region will have to adapt the design and implementation of its Industry 4.0 policies to the specific characteristics of its regional innovation system. Therefore the replication of policies from other regions will not be an effective mechanism for promoting Industry 4.0 since the transition to Industry 4.0 is a very regional specific and diverse process.",Sandulli F.; Gimenez-Fernandez E.; Rodriguez Ferradas M.,Journal,European Planning Studies,2021-01-01,Universidad Complutense de Madrid;Tecnum–University of Navarra,Digital transformation ;  innovation policy ;  institutions ;  knowledge bases ;  legitimacy ;  Technological change

Bottom-up analysis engineering of investigative practices and innovation of reflective activities in life and earth sciences: From information theory to systems theory,"The heavy trends of the Information Society are knowledge that requires the spirit of innovation, creativity, flexibility and critical thinking ""more than benign introspection."" In addition, information about each other's relationships with oneself, the other and the environment is crucial to enable individuals to understand the complex reality. The Moroccan school is part of this societal vision, by renovating its education and training programs, which claim the development of the quality of procedural, cognitive and metacognitive strategies. In this perspective this research work aimed at studying the engineering analysis of investigation approaches in the teaching of SVT for the implementation of a reflexive practice in lycian learners, generating the ability to process information and invest in mechanisms for understanding, conceptualizing and proceduralizing cognitive and metacognitive strategies. Informational investigative capacity is crucial because it informs learning decisions, which can lead to innovations in the delivery of cognitive styles. To do this, we chose to conduct our study, through interview surveys and semi-structured questionnaires. The first among teachers and the second for SVT inspectors from three provincial directorates of National Education. The results show that the majority of those involved in education are involved in the classical informational approach and the experimental approach. The use of investigative analysis approaches remains episodic in some learning units (scientific ecological output and DNA extraction). Teachers are keen to introduce new information technologies to create favourable conditions for learning about investigative approaches, in order to improve the power of analysis, treatment and critical thinking and coping with situations of authentic and novel learning.

Modeling engineering of therapeutic education approaches for diabetic patients and quality of the support and human resources management process : Towards a new challenge in the management of public health,"The modeling engineering of psychotherapeutic approaches to diabetic patients has a positive impact on the quality of the support process and organizational, personal and professional development, in the sense that the education and neuro-educational training project constitutes a powerful human resources management vector. The research would attempt to analyze therapeutic education models and corresponding health promotion approaches, as well as the identification of methods and techniques used in health practice As a result, the quality of the neuro-educational approaches is the guarantor of the effectiveness of the recommended support system. Adopting this imperative highlight, a new PCA patient-centered approach. This major concern therefore calls on the medical profession to question the impact and effects of collaborative support in the process of building and developing the conceptual, procedural and behavioral skills of diabetic patients which facilitate their self-knowledge, their self-determination and their awareness of the factors of therapeutic effectiveness and the promotion of their physical, moral, social and psychological well-being. It prompts us to ask ourselves how the different care teams and support actors organize and coordinate their andragogical actions, with a view to complementarity and synergy. We proceed, through a descriptive and exploratory research approach, opting for a so-called longitudinal survey, by a semi-directive questionnaire and by an interview technique. By comparing the results of the study with the validation interviews, it emerges that appropriate attention must be paid to the support process to allow the diabetic patient to master all the components of reflective therapeutic practice and to achieve his personal and organizational development necessary for the development of a subject actor of change and innovation. This support system engineering will define the frame of reference, including the ethical values and the basis of the required professional skills which will be applicable to any program for the development of cognitive and behavioral skills in diabetic patients. The new vision will be built around adapted support practices, collaborative approaches, a comprehensive, harmonious and balanced therapeutic education program, personalized training courses and inclusive evaluation methods that go well beyond validation and tenure.

Engineering of techno-pedagogical innovation in science and technique of physical and sports activities (ctsstaps),"In an EPS lesson, the student can learn in three different ways, including learning by doing, observing, or thinking; the last method will be the subject of our study, the objective of which is to show how a debate of ideas (sociocognitive conflict), between a group of students will make it possible to construct learning through the educational mediation of the teacher? So by verbalizing the problems encountered in learning situations and concretizing theoretical behaviors (proceduralization of knowledge), students will be able to learn in an autonomous and responsible manner (self-management). This expected result is one of the purposes of competence-based pedagogy as well as the pedagogical orientations, namely to train a citizen capable of developing powers of analysis and reflection and the ability to adapt (the national charter for education and training) Control groups were planned to facilitate comparison of the results. At the end of the experiment, we noticed that the students in the experienced groups made greater progress than those in the control groups. The progress that has been made by the experienced groups confirms the research hypothesis that the learning built by the students themselves through a collective project based on the verbalization of actions and problem solving is not only more profitable for the students but also for the teacher.",Aboufirass R.; Lotfi S.; Talbi M.,Journal,Journal of Information Technology Management,2021-01-01,Laboratoire de Chimie Analytique et Physicochimie des Matériaux;Hassan II University of Casablanca,Engineering ;  Information processing systems ;  Socio-cognitive conflict ;  Techno-pedagogical innovation
Review of Remote Usability Methods for Aging in Place Technologies,"This paper reports on the study of best practices in evaluation methodologies for aging in place technologies, and analyses their feasibility in a pandemic environment. The pandemic situation, with various physical distancing restrictions in place, especially for vulnerable older adults, has increased the importance of deploying health monitoring and social interaction technologies for aging in place. The pandemic also made it more difficult for researchers and developers of technologies to evaluate the usability of home health monitoring technologies. Existing technology evaluation methods mostly involve laboratory and home technology usability evaluations that could be problematic during physical distancing restrictions, and are not well suited for rapid evaluation of health monitoring technologies. The increasing trend in virtual doctor and health professional visits puts additional pressure to speed up innovation for home health and wellness monitoring and communication technologies without increasing risks for vulnerable populations. Researchers observed challenges with performing HCI research with older adults in a pandemic situation, including challenges with participant recruitment, obtaining informed consent for the study, shipping technology to the willing participants, assessing the ability of older adults to set up both digital health technology and remote usability tools, and research data collection. The need for low cost, low risk, easy to use and privacy-preserving usability evaluation methods and tools for home health monitoring is growing rapidly, and new remote usability evaluation methods and tools will add to the growing arsenal of digital technologies used in the public health response to COVID-19 and beyond.",Kondratova I.; Fournier H.; Katsuragawa K.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2021-01-01,National Research Council Canada,Aging in place ;  Home health monitoring ;  Remote usability evaluation ;  Usability evaluation methods
The Cognitive Study of Immersive Experience in Science and Art Exhibition,"In terms of the history of design development, human engineering emerged after World War II in the 1950s, and continued to the rise of personal computers in the 1980s. Human-oriented interface design and human-oriented interactive interfaces are more important. In the 21st century, the age of sensibility is approaching. The so-called pleasure or experience, when it comes to cultural creativity, its interaction with “people” becomes more important. Since the 1980s, science and technology art exhibitions have begun to focus on audience participation. Facing the challenges of the new century, why do you need to apply interactive technology in the art exhibition scene? What are the factors that affect the audience’s experience of the immersive space? How to integrate resources to provide service innovation? It is a topic of contemporary art exhibition. This research is based on literature discussion and case studies. It first sorts out the application of technology in Taiwan’s art exhibitions in the past three years, and then focuses on the case of all-tech immersive performances. Through observation of the audience experience and focus group interviews at the exhibition site, we can understand the audience’s perception of immersive immersion. The cognitive model of space is used as a reference for the modification of exhibition design. In the future cultural performance stage, it is necessary to combine interactive technology with cultural connotation through the audience’s experience, with educational concepts and interpretation creation as the purpose, and practical application in the new creative planning project of the exhibition space to complete cultural added value. And further develop service innovations to achieve the goals of “Co-produce”, “Co-design” and “Co-deliver” for exhibitors and participants.",Chang C.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2021-01-01,National Taiwan University of Arts,Hermeneutic theory ;  Immersive experience ;  Metacognition ;  Service innovation

From Imitation to Innovation: A Case Study of an Amateur Artist,"Imitation is a human instinct, and it is an effective way for humans to learn new things. Imitation is an effective method in the process of learning painting. With the advent of the era of national aesthetics, everyone has the opportunity to become creators. Generally speaking, they have not received professional training, so they are called “Amateur Artist”. This research takes the process of learning painting by an amateur artist with an engineering background as an example and selects 10 groups of his imitated paintings as experimental samples for questionnaire survey and analysis. A total of 322 interviewees from domestic and foreign have participated. The result shows that: (1) Although this amateur artist didn’t start learning painting until he was 70, he has quickly mastered the expression skills of painting through imitation. So that part of his work can even surpass the original. (2) The interviewees’ understanding of the “painting” does not affect their confidence and reason for judging the “original”. They rely more on their intuition to make judgments. (3) Whether the interviewees like the “original works” has little relevance to the attributes they judge they are “original works”. This research can be provided as a reference for readers who are learning painting or planning to treat painting as leisure.

Research on Smart Shopping Cart Modeling Design Based on Kansei Engineering,"With the continuous development of intelligent technologies such as the Internet of Things, traditional supermarkets are also constantly exploring new ways of retailing. The smart shopping cart is a corresponding innovation. Through market and literature research, it is found that the existing design research of smart shopping cart focuses too much on the integration and implementation of technology, without fully considering the aesthetic and emotional needs of users for modeling. In this paper, the modeling design of the smart shopping cart is mainly based on the design method of Kansei Engineering. Firstly, the design positioning of the smart shopping cart is determined, that is, consumers aged 18–35 in large supermarkets are taken as the target users. Secondly, related product databases and perceptual vocabulary databases were established. After screening 40 groups of perceptual vocabulary by KJ method, 6 groups of vocabulary were obtained. Then the SD method is used to conduct a questionnaire survey on users. Finally, by drawing the intention scale map and analyzing the data, the three design elements of “simple and simple”, “light and large capacity” and “friendly streamline” were summarized. Combined with the functional requirements and ergonomics, the shape design was carried out. Finally, the design practice was recognized by design experts and the public through the survey of satisfaction. This study is an effective practice and exploration of Kansei Engineering design methods, providing new design ideas for the development of the smart shopping cart industry, and further improving the competitiveness and user experience of supermarkets.",Ye J.; Wang M.; Zhu S.; Wang J.; Liu X.,Book Series,Communications in Computer and Information Science,2021-01-01,East China University of Science and Technology,Kansei Engineering ;  Modeling design ;  Semantic scaling method ;  Smart shopping cart

Innovative approaches to the Sustainable Development Goals using Big Earth Data,"A persistent challenge for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has been a lack of data for indicators to assess progress towards each goal and varying capacities among nations to conduct these assessments. Rapid developments in big data, however, are facilitating a global approach to the SDGs. Tools and data products are emerging that can be extended to and leveraged by nations that do not yet have the capacity to measure SDG indicators. Big Earth Data, a special class of big data, integrates multi-source data within a geographic context, utilizing the principles and methodologies of the established literature on big data science, applied specifically to Earth system science. This paper discusses the research challenges related to Big Earth Data and the concerted efforts and investments required to make and measure progress towards the SDGs. As an example, the Big Earth Data Science Engineering Program (CASEarth) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is presented along with other case studies on Big Earth Data in support of the SDGs. Lastly, the paper proposes future priorities for developments in Big Earth Data, such as human resource capacity, digital infrastructure, interoperability, and environmental considerations.",Guo H.; Liang D.; Chen F.; Shirazi Z.,Journal,Big Earth Data,2021-01-01,Aerospace Information Research Institute;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;International Research Center of Big Data for Sustainable Development Goals,Big Earth Data ;  CASEarth ;  data science ;  decision support ;  Sustainable Development Goals
Extending Business Model Development Tools with Consolidated Expert Knowledge,"Business Model Innovation (BMI) is a creative process that often needs collaboration between different stakeholders with the support of domain experts. Instead of innovation workshops where the domain experts need to be physically present, software-based tools allow reusing the knowledge of many domain experts independent of their actual presence. This reusing of expert knowledge, which improves the quality of the developed business models, is currently not supported by existing Business Model Development Tools (BMDTs). To address this shortcoming, we present an approach to support BMDTs with consolidated knowledge of different experts. In our approach, domain experts formalize their knowledge about business models for particular domains in expert models to make them useable within and transferable between different tools. Business developers can subsequently choose the expert models they need, consolidate the knowledge, and use it within the BMI process. With this approach, we provide a three-fold contribution to the research of BMDTs: First, we design a modeling language to store the business model knowledge of individual experts. Second, we develop a concept to consolidate expert knowledge and detect possible knowledge conflicts. Third, we provide blueprints to add expert knowledge into existing BMDTs. We demonstrate the technical feasibility of our approach with an open-source BMDT implementation and show the applicability with an exemplary instantiation of a local event platform.",Gottschalk S.; Kirchhoff J.; Engels G.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing,2021-01-01,Paderborn University,Business domain knowledge ;  Business Model Development Tool ;  Business Model Innovation ;  Expert knowledge
An industrial policy framework for transforming energy and emissions intensive industries towards zero emissions,"The target of zero emissions sets a new standard for industry and industrial policy. Industrial policy in the twenty-first century must aim to achieve zero emissions in the energy and emissions intensive industries. Sectors such as steel, cement, and chemicals have so far largely been sheltered from the effects of climate policy. A major shift is needed, from contemporary industrial policy that mainly protects industry to policy strategies that transform the industry. For this purpose, we draw on a wide range of literatures including engineering, economics, policy, governance, and innovation studies to propose a comprehensive industrial policy framework. The policy framework relies on six pillars: directionality, knowledge creation and innovation, creating and reshaping markets, building capacity for governance and change, international coherence, and sensitivity to socio-economic implications of phase-outs. Complementary solutions relying on technological, organizational, and behavioural change must be pursued in parallel and throughout whole value chains. Current policy is limited to supporting mainly some options, e.g. energy efficiency and recycling, with some regions also adopting carbon pricing, although most often exempting the energy and emissions intensive industries. An extended range of options, such as demand management, materials efficiency, and electrification, must also be pursued to reach zero emissions. New policy research and evaluation approaches are needed to support and assess progress as these industries have hitherto largely been overlooked in domestic climate policy as well as international negotiations. Key policy insights Energy and emission intensive industries can no longer be complacent about the necessity of zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Zero emissions require profound technology and organizational changes across whole material value chains, from primary production to reduced demand, recycling and end-of-life of metals, cement, plastics, and other materials. New climate and industrial policies are necessary to transform basic materials industries, which are so far relatively sheltered from climate mitigation. It is important to complement technology R&D with the reshaping of markets and strengthened governance capacities in this emerging policy domain. Industrial transformation can be expected to take centre stage in future international climate policy and negotiations.",Nilsson L.; Bauer F.; Åhman M.; Andersson F.; Bataille C.; de la Rue du Can S.; Ericsson K.; Hansen T.; Johansson B.; Lechtenböhmer S.; van Sluisveld M.; Vogl V.,Journal,Climate Policy,2021-01-01,"Wuppertal Institut für Klima, Umwelt, Energie;Nationalekonomiska Institutionen;SciencesPo Paris;Miljö- och Energisystem;Københavns Universitet;Lunds Universitet;Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory;Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency;SINTEF Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research",climate policy ;  decarbonization ;  Industrial policy ;  industry

A “crescendo” model: designing food experiences for psychological well-being,"Purpose: This paper aims to advance the design-thinking approach in food from an engineering mind-set toward a positive psychology perspective by investigating how consumer experiences evoked by food-related activities can facilitate, stimulate and enhance individuals’ happiness and perceptions of life satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach: A diary field experiment was conducted. Participants from a major European city were asked to reflect on their food-related activities, provide descriptions and answer questions on experiential stimulation derived from these activities in relation to happiness and perceived life satisfaction. Findings: Food-related activities generally result in positive consumer experiences and psychological well-being. Experiential stimulation resulting from food activities is positively related to perceived life satisfaction directly and indirectly via pleasure and meaning. Although the authors found an overall positive relationship between these constructs, they also found differences based on the experience type considered. A “crescendo model” of experiences that details how experiences lead to happiness and perceived life satisfaction is presented. Research limitations/implications: This study is largely exploratory. Future research should adopt an experimental approach and further test the relationship between experiential stimulation, happiness and perceived life satisfaction in the context of food. Practical implications: The paper offers innovation teams in food companies a practical “crescendo model” that can be used to design product–consumer interactions. Originality/value: The research bridges literatures on design thinking, psychological well-being and consumer experiences. By studying the relationship between experiences, happiness and perceived life satisfaction in the context of food, the findings contribute to research on food well-being by expanding the notion of happiness seen only as pleasure. The research also contributes to work on design thinking by offering an experiential framework that contributes to the notion of consumer empathy.",Zarantonello L.; Grappi S.; Formisano M.; Schmitt B.,Journal,European Journal of Marketing,2021-01-01,Columbia University;University of Roehampton;Università degli Studi di Modena e Reggio Emilia;Planning Insights,Consumer experience ;  Design thinking ;  Food ;  Happiness ;  Perceived life satisfaction ;  Psychological well-being

Developing strategies in system level model of smart cyber physical system,"It was long way to current highly integrated and smart modeling and simulation in engineering. This way started with separated problem solving for representation, manufacturing control, and visualization of mathematical surfaces. By now, autonomous engineering model system (EMS) serves lifecycle innovation and engineering of systems operated autonomous intelligent industrial and commercial products. Modeling platforms constitute one of the most important and extensive application areas in information technology. Advanced EMS is highly integrated, multidisciplinary, and multipurposed model structure. Any contribution to EMS must use contextual object modeling (CM) and continuous engineering (CE) which are within the most important achievements in engineering during the past two decades. Considering the above situation, this paper introduces the novel organized content model (OCM) approach, concept, and methodology as contribution to integrated and lifecycle serving model system of highly automated products. OCM organizes driving contexts for lifecycle of modeled product. It is an extension to the currently prevailing EMS structure to contribute fulfilling the new requirement of active context based integration of virtual (EMS) with physically operating cyber physical system (CPS) products. Other essential requirement is that relevant objects in EMS and CPS must be contextually driven by higher level decisions, intellectual property (IP) items, and human intervention attempts while EMS and CPS are increasingly autonomous. Therefore, main purpose of OCM is to support active driving contextual connections for EMS and CPS. In this way, this paper discusses integrated model of highly automated complex product system, extended OCM for situation controlled product system, and Support of Situation Awareness by OCM. Research for OCM is done at the Laboratory of Intelligent Engineering Systems (IESL). In this context, preliminary research at IESL and concept of configuring professional cloud organized modeling platform for the purpose of virtual research laboratory (VRL) are also included in this paper.",Horváth L.,Journal,Acta Polytechnica Hungarica,2021-01-01,John von Neumann Faculty of Informatics,Engineering model system ;  Organized content model ;  Situation based modeling ;  Smart cyber physical system ;  System level modeling
From Industrial Design to Healthcare Innovation—A Comparative Study on the Role of User-Centered Design and Stanford Biodesign Process,"User-centered design (UCD) process is a comprehensive and widely accepted methodology practiced by designers across numerous areas of specializations like product design, user experience design, interaction design, web design etc. The central philosophy of this approach is to empathize with the user at various design decisions in order to fulfill user requirements. Like UCD approach, the Stanford Biodesign process is also an accepted and widely used framework specifically for health technology innovation. UCD philosophy and the Stanford Biodesign process both lay strong emphasis on deep understanding of user(s) and stakeholders as their basis for focused ideation and development. However, health technology innovation brings additional challenges and constraints in its course of design and development, which not only require to satisfy user requirements but also clinical and demographic requirements for successful healthcare implementation. This paper discloses such challenges of health technology design and development and synthesizes the requirements that need to be considered in a design methodology. Later, based on these requirements the paper compared both Stanford Biodesign process and UCD process in terms of methodological effectiveness for highly sensitive healthcare innovation. The paper also highlights issues where UCD approach fails to address some of the requirements for healthcare innovation and suggests additional contexts and stages to be considered by a UCD practitioner as an easy adaptation for healthcare design projects.",Dutta N.; Dhar D.,Book Series,"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies",2021-01-01,Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati,Biodesign innovation process ;  Biomedical design process ;  Health technology innovation ;  Healthcare innovation process ;  Healthcare-centered design ;  Stanford biodesign process ;  User-centered design

Data-driven strategy maps: A hybrid approach to strategic and performance management combining hard data and experts' knowledge,"A Strategy Map is a tool that depicts the interrelationships between the key performance indicators of a company. Strategy Maps are considered as Decision Support Systems by allowing the user to understand the consequences of a decision on other indicators of the business which is crucial in decision-making. To this date, the majority of the practical development of Strategy Maps is based on the knowledge and intuition of experts of the company regardless of the methodology used. These”soft data” present a number of drawbacks when implementing Strategy Maps: in accuracy, in completeness and a lack of longitudinal perspective. Currently, technological innovations enable to collect, store and analyze more data. These”hard data” are a powerful source of information used in Decision Support Systems to enhance strategic decision-making. We suggest to integrate hard data in the development process of the Strategy Maps in order to increase their reliability. This paper presents the outline of a research project related to the use of hard data in Strategy Maps. Five research questions are presented in order to contribute to the current literature with theoretical conclusions, methodological propositions and empirical demonstrations.",Pirnay L.,Conference Proceeding,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2021-01-01,Namur Digital Institute,Data mining ;  Performance measurement models ;  Strategic decision-Making ;  Strategic management ;  Strategy map

"Opportunistic diagnosis of osteoporosis, fragile bone strength and vertebral fractures from routine CT scans; a review of approved technology systems and pathways to implementation","Osteoporosis causes bones to become weak, porous and fracture more easily. While a vertebral fracture is the archetypal fracture of osteoporosis, it is also the most difficult to diagnose clinically. Patients often suffer further spine or other fractures, deformity, height loss and pain before diagnosis. There were an estimated 520,000 fragility fractures in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2017 (costing £4.5 billion), a figure set to increase 30% by 2030. One way to improve both vertebral fracture identification and the diagnosis of osteoporosis is to assess a patient’s spine or hips during routine computed tomography (CT) scans. Patients attend routine CT for diagnosis and monitoring of various medical conditions, but the skeleton can be overlooked as radiologists concentrate on the primary reason for scanning. More than half a million CT scans done each year in the National Health Service (NHS) could potentially be screened for osteoporosis (increasing 5% annually). If CT-based screening became embedded in practice, then the technique could have a positive clinical impact in the identification of fragility fracture and/or low bone density. Several companies have developed software methods to diagnose osteoporosis/fragile bone strength and/or identify vertebral fractures in CT datasets, using various methods that include image processing, computational modelling, artificial intelligence and biomechanical engineering concepts. Technology to evaluate Hounsfield units is used to calculate bone density, but not necessarily bone strength. In this rapid evidence review, we summarise the current literature underpinning approved technologies for opportunistic screening of routine CT images to identify fractures, bone density or strength information. We highlight how other new software technologies have become embedded in NHS clinical practice (having overcome barriers to implementation) and highlight how the novel osteoporosis technologies could follow suit. We define the key unanswered questions where further research is needed to enable the adoption of these technologies for maximal patient benefit.",Aggarwal V.; Maslen C.; Abel R.; Bhattacharya P.; Bromiley P.; Clark E.; Compston J.; Crabtree N.; Gregory J.; Kariki E.; Harvey N.; Ward K.; Poole K.,Journal,Therapeutic Advances in Musculoskeletal Disease,2021-01-01,"Birmingham Women’s and Children’s NHS Foundation Trust;Kingston Hospital NHS Foundation Trust;School of Clinical Medicine;University of Southampton, Faculty of Medicine;University of Southampton;University of Bristol;Imperial College London;University of Aberdeen School of Medicine, Medical Sciences and Nutrition;The University of Manchester;The University of Sheffield;Health Evidence Matters",artificial intelligence ;  computed tomography ;  epidemiology ;  fragility fracture ;  innovation ;  Osteoporosis ;  QCT ;  screening ;  technology ;  vertebral fracture
Research progress on rapid optimization design methods of metamaterials based on intelligent algorithms,"At present, research on metamaterials is continuously advancing to engineering applications, and great progress is being achieved in the areas of physical mechanisms and effects, design theory and methods, and fabrication and measurement. However, traditional metamaterials design mainly relies on artificial design and optimization. In the face of large-scale engineering applications, it is impossible to realize the rapid overall design of a large number of metamaterial structural units. In recent years, the proportion of intelligent algorithms covering traditional heuristic algorithms and neural network algorithms in metamaterials design has increased gradually. Metamaterials design based on intelligent algorithms can surpass the limitation of traditional methods in different substrate systems, frequency variation, and different performance indicators, offering the unique advantages of rapid design and architectural innovation. This paper summarizes the application of several typical intelligent algorithms, including the genetic algorithm, Hopfield network algorithm, and deep learning algorithm in metamaterials design, which include forward designs and an inverse design. The use of intelligent algorithms can achieve the rapid design of frequency selective surfaces under different performance indexes, multi-mechanisms composite absorber metamaterials, flat focusing, and abnormal reflection metasurfaces, providing the necessary support for design methods while promoting the engineering applications of metamaterials.",Jia Y.; Wang J.; Chen W.; Sui S.; Zhu R.; Qiu T.; Li Y.; Han Y.; Qu S.,Journal,Journal of Radars,2021-01-01,Air Force Engineering University China,Frequency selective surface ;  Heuristic algorithm ;  Metamaterials ;  Neural network algorithm ;  Phase gradient metasurface ;  Sub-wavelength

Real work with real consequences: Enlisting community energy engineering as an approach to envisioning engineering in context,"This study describes an illustrative case study from a year-round program that positions middle and high school youth to explore the social value of energy systems in their homes, schools, and neighborhoods. Designed to center existing youth assets, interests and values, Community Energy Engineering (CEE) frames engineering as a tool that students can enlist in order to understand and interrogate their local socio-energy system while also acting to transform it. CEE partners with Title 1 schools in Latino/a neighborhoods in the U.S. southwest. CEE situates youth community-based solar energy innovation projects as consequential, evolving in and with historically contingent engineering practices, and shaping and shaped by interactions across multiple contexts. We present our analysis of an asset-based approach to pre-college energy engineering education by following an exemplary project team across 15 months of programming. We used critical design ethnography to address the research question: How do community-centered energy engineering projects organize opportunities for productive disciplinary engagement and consequential learning? Findings are presented through the endogenous, first-person accounts of five youth as they participated in their project, and as they reflected on their participation during interviews. We consider connections to a wider array of cases reported using a sociocultural theoretical perspective on asset-based approaches to pre-college engineering education. We discuss these connections in relation to reciprocity as an asset-based approach to ingenuity and care, as well as two overarching design principles that emerged: (a) real work with real consequences and (b) everyone a learner, everyone a contributor.",Jordan M.; Zuiker S.; Wakefield W.; Delarosa M.,Journal,Journal of Pre-College Engineering Education Research,2021-01-01,Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College;Alhambra Unified School District,Asset-based ;  Consequential learning ;  Engineering ;  Engineering design ;  Productive disciplinary engagement ;  Renewable energy
The implementation of Lean Six Sigma for operational excellence in digital emerging technology companies,"Purpose: The purpose of this research is to develop a better understanding of the hurdles in implementing Lean Six Sigma (LSS) for operational excellence in digital emerging technology companies. Design/methodology/approach: We have conducted case studies of LSS implementations in six US-based companies in the digital emerging technology industry. Findings: Critical success factors (CSF) for LSS implementations in digital emerging technology companies are: (1) organizational leadership that is engaged to the implementation, (2) LSS methodology that is rebranded to fit existing shared values in the organization, (3) restructuring of the traditional LSS training program to include a more incremental, prioritized, on-the-job training approach and (4) a modified LSS project execution methodology that includes (a) condensing the phases and tools applied in LSS projects and (b) adopting more iterative project management methods compared to the standard phased LSS project approach. Research limitations/implications: The qualitative nature of our analysis and the geographic coverage of our sample limit the generalizability of our findings. Practical implications: Implications comprise the awareness and knowledge of critical success factors and LSS methodology modifications specifically relevant for digital emerging technology companies or companies that share similarities in terms of focus on product development, innovation and growth, such as R&D departments in high-tech manufacturing companies.

"Protecting Intellectual Property and Appropriating Value from Innovations in Weak Appropriability Regimes: Two constructs, barrier to imitation and barrier to commercialization, are two tools multinational enterprises can use to block imitators.","Overview: How can multinational enterprises (MNEs) protect their intellectual property (IP) when patents are weakly enforced? An imitator will only take action to appropriate an innovator’s value if the imitator has the financial motivation, opportunity, and ability to copy and commercialize the innovator’s product/service. If the innovator can decrease one of these conditions to a level that demotivates or inhibits the imitator from taking action, the innovator will have protected its IP. In this article, we introduce the constructs of barrier to imitation and barrier to commercialization, two separate hurdles that can block imitators from appropriating MNE rents. We prescribe MNE IP strategies contingent on country characteristics, local imitator capabilities, an MNE’s barriers to imitation and commercialization, and the value chain activities the MNE desires to locate in the country of interest.",Nebus J.; Chai K.; Subramanian A.,Journal,Research Technology Management,2021-01-01,National University of Singapore;Suffolk University,Non-patent IP protection mechanisms ;  Value appropriation ;  Weak appropriability regimes
Countering Commoditization Through InnovationChallenges for European B2B Companies: B2B companies can use a Commoditization-Innovativeness Matrix to identify actions to counteract the pervasive threat of commoditization that exists in many B2B markets.,"Overview: B2B companies are an important part of the global economy, and traditionally they have relied on technological capabilities to compete. Currently, the B2B sector is under increasing pressure, as many B2B companies no longer have a technological advantage, and they also face commoditization. Companies see innovation as a way to compete against these challenges. Although product and process innovation are important in B2B markets, companies need other forms of innovation such as service and business model innovation to create a differentiated offering. B2B managers’ views on the value of market research vary widely, and many are unaware that sophisticated techniques such as ethnography can effectively identify B2B customer needs. Our Commoditization-Innovativeness Matrix is a diagnosis tool that enables B2B companies to identify actions that can counter commoditization.",Goffin K.; Beznosov A.; Seiler M.,Journal,Research Technology Management,2021-01-01,Cranfield School of Management;Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf;Handelshögskolan i Stockholm;Cranfield University,B2B companies ;  Commoditization ;  Competitive strategy ;  Customer needs
Nanopreparations in technologies of plants growing,"The use of engineered nanomaterials in sustainable agriculture has demonstrated a completely new way of food production that can potentially overcome uncertainty in the agricultural sector with limited available resources. Nanoparticle engineering is one of the latest technological innovations which demonstrate unique target characteristics. During 2013–2020, research on the directions and effectiveness of nanopreparations in plant growing: nutrient source, activation of photosynthesis, immunocorrectors, stimulators of seed germination, plant growth and development, multivalent drugs for increasing plant resistance to stress was conducted. Monoparticles, nanoparticle combinations, and chelate complex of nano fertilizers on crops of soybean were tested. Field research was conducted in a stationary field experiment of the Plant Science Department of the National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine. The soil of the stationary experiment is typical chernozem. In research was used soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) of early-ripening variety Horol. Over the years of research, weather conditions varied, but were within the typical for zone of research. Average monthly temperatures were close or higher the perennial average indicators. The purpose of the research is to find out the influence of pre-sowing seed treatment and fertilizing of crops by nano-preparations Avatar (microfertilizer of carboxylates of natural acids), Iodis-concentrate (immunomodulator-stimulator of growth processes), and Super Micro Plus (nanochelate fertilizer) on leaf formation-rate, the activity of symbiotic nitrogen fixation and yield of soybean variety Horol. Nanopreparations were used for pre-sowing seed treatment and fertilizing-spraying during the growing season in several doses. The use of nanopreparations, as seed treatment in combination with inoculation and as fertilizer, intensified formation of the leaf surface area, symbiotic apparatus activity of soybean plants. The introduction of nanofertilizers complex in the top-dressing helped to increase yields and change the functional quality of crop products which indicates their unconditional effectiveness. Soybean yield significantly depended on weather conditions, varying from 1.23 to 3.48 t ha-1 depending on the weather conditions and the combination of seed inoculation and nanofertilizer. Soybean yield under favourable weather conditions in 2016, depending on the use of preparation combination ranged from 2.27 to 3.48 t ha-1. As a result of the research, it was found that the use of nanopreparations Avatar, Jodis-concentrate and Super Micro Plus for seed treatment and fertilizing intensified leaf surface formation and symbiotic apparatus activity of soybean plants. The obtained results confirm that application of nanofertilizers complex Jodis-concentrate, Avatar and nano chelate fertilizer Super Micro Plus in the soybean fertilizing helped to increase the yield, which testifies to their unconditional effectiveness. The highest efficiency of nanofertilizers was shown by inoculation and seed treatment by Avatar and fertilizing by Avatar + nano chelate fertilizer Super Micro Plus, providing the formation of 52.4 thousand m2 ha-1 of leaf surface area of soybean varieties Horol, 69.7 pcs per plant of root nodules, 785 mg per plant of their weight and yield at the level of 2.79 t ha-1 an average of five years.",Kalenska S.; Novytska N.; Stolyarchuk T.; Kalenskyi V.; Garbar L.; Sadko M.; Shutiy O.; Sonko R.,Journal,Agronomy Research,2021-01-01,National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine,Forms of fertilizers ;  Nano fertilizers ;  Soybean ;  Yields
A review of FinTech research,"The aim of this paper is to review previous research on FinTech, which may be broadly understood as financial innovation that uses information technology to provide financial services. The paper describes a review of 88 refereed academic papers on the subject of FinTech published in journals that have high SJR2017 scores. Papers were categorised according to the type of companies leveraging FinTech (existing financial institutions vs. new entrants) and the type of value derived from FinTech innovation (new value-added vs. improved efficiency). Also considered were types of new value-added, geographical focus of the research and research methodologies. The largest number of studies concerned the use of FinTech innovation by new entrants to offer solutions to social issues or build new financial ecosystems. Over half the studies were on FinTech in Asia or the European Union, and the most common methodology employed was the case study.",Takeda A.; Ito Y.,Journal,International Journal of Technology Management,2021-01-01,Nagaoka University of Technology,Bank marketing ;  Crowdfunding ;  Financial inclusion ;  Financial innovation ;  FinTech ;  Information technology ;  Innovation management ;  IT ;  P2P lending ;  RegTech ;  Technology management
Direct subsidies or tax credits? The effects of different R&D policy tools,"Governments increasingly recognise the benefits of direct subsidies and tax credits for supporting private sectors to adopt research and development (R&D) activities. However, the different reactions of firms toward these two types of measures have remained with advance financial support, whereas tax credits wait until the R&D expense has been incurred to pay back. Thus, the former is better at attenuating risk, but leaves recipients with less discretion in their research efforts. Firms with more financial resources can more easily overcome such constraints. Tax credits provide more flexibility to using the money. This can be especially beneficial for firms whose financial resources are limited. These ideas were tested using data on research support and research outcomes describing 2,748 Chinese firms in Beijing Zhongguancun Science Park between 2012 and 2015. Analyses of those data delivered support for the preceding arguments.",Xie Z.; Xie L.; Li J.,Journal,International Journal of Technology Management,2021-01-01,Antai College of Economics and Management;Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management;Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,China ;  Innovation performance ;  Policy effectiveness ;  Subsidies ;  Tax credits
Investigating factors that impact the development of entrepreneurial interest among engineering students,"Entrepreneurship is a crucial skill in today's world, especially in the engineering and hi-tech industries, but engineering education is still lagging behind in finding ways to teach entrepreneurship. The purpose of this study is to clarify the factors that contribute to entrepreneurship tendencies among engineering students and to use them as an entrepreneurship predictor tool. We conducted research on 95 undergraduate engineering students, for which we used well-documented personality analysis and entrepreneurial questionnaires. In particular, we analyzed the relationship between personality profiling and entrepreneurial intention, and we examined entrepreneurship according to the types of goals that drive innovative behavior. We discovered four main factors that contribute to entrepreneurial behavior: motivation, control, innovative personality, and ability to get support. In addition, our findings indicate that while emotional intelligence contributes to the engineering students' entrepreneurial intention, students with an established perception of gender equality have higher entrepreneurship intention. This suggests that their entrepreneurial tendencies will benefit from an enhanced perception of gender equality. The importance of this study is that it points out the crucial impact of the perception of gender equality in the early stages of student development in the academic world. This pinpoints the effect of gender equality on entrepreneurial and innovation intention. Therefore, it is crucial to examine how gender equality and emotional intelligence can be incorporated into the curriculum of engineering studies. The challenges of teaching entrepreneurship in engineering education as well as the difficulties of involving women as entrepreneurs can both be solved by actions that foster entrepreneurship for women in the educational setting.",Shmallo R.; Shrot T.; Madar N.,Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2021-01-01,Sami Shamoon College of Engineering,Engineering education ;  Entrepreneurial intention ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Gender differences ;  Personality factors
The responsible innovation framework: A framework for integrating trust and delight into technology innovation,"Although systematic biases in our intelligent systems and lack of privacy, equity, and ethical and trust considerations have entered AI and emerging technology debate, we are still lacking a common practice-based framework for innovation that puts social well-being if not ahead at least on par with growth and profits. This comes at a cost that includes public trust. This paper introduces The Responsible Innovation Framework as a tool with a reframing of stakeholders, value-sets, and influences. Who is this for? It's for everyone who's involved in decision-making for products and technology especially leaders and practitioners. The paper 1) makes a case for using a common framework starting from the ideation and vision stage or introducing it anywhere in the process, 2) describes the “essential” components of the framework: stakeholders, value sets, and influencers, 3) provides examples of how value sets could be leveraged in a flexible and iterative way for AI or Non-AI technology, and 4) lays out the need for additional work and case studies. The goal of the framework is to include social considerations as an essential part of technology decision making.",Roy A.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,2021-01-01,The Responsible Innovation Project,
IT-enabled sustainable supply chain management capability maturity,"The increasing importance of sustainability gives rise to the sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). To help organizations develop their SSCM capabilities with IT support, this paper proposes an IT-enabled sustainability supply chain management capability maturity model (SSCM CMM). Based on the previous literature, seven SSCM capabilities and four IT dimensions are identified. A five-level maturity model is then defined based on these two domains. The model is preliminarily examined through an in-depth case study with an Australian company. The case study reveals that the role played by IT is not fully recognized, the integration of IT function for sustainability into other organizational functions should be appropriately guided, and sustainability innovation capability deserves more attention. This study guides future research to systematically explore the role of IT and investigate the progression of IT-enabled SSCM implementation and provides a useful tool for organizations to develop their SSCM capabilities with the support of IT.",Peng X.; Kurnia S.; Cui T.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,2021-01-01,University of Melbourne,
Compact cold atom gravimeters and precise gravity measurement,"Atomic gravimetry measures the gravitional acceleration of an ensemble of identical neutral atoms through the atom interferometry based on Raman two-photon transition, where the Raman lasers are used as “optical ruler” and the identical neutral atoms play the role of test mass and quantum storage of gravity field information. As the novel gravimetry system suffers no mechanical wear and works at a higher repetition rate, atom gravimetry can reach a much better short-term sensitivity than the classical falling-corner-cube counterpart, and the accuracy is reasonably well. Since the very first in-laboratory device built over 30 years ago, atomic gravimetry has matured to a versatile tool that offers both precise and accurate absolute gravity measurement to fundamental research and metrology, such as testing the weak equivalence principle or linking the mass and weight of the test mass in Watt (Kibble) balance. As the current rapid development of compact cold-atom gravimeters, atomic gravimetry is moving out of the laboratory to be used as a quantum enhancement of classical devices in dynamical measurement, such as geophysics survey, inertial navigation and space mission. We review the roadmap for the development of cold-atom absolute gravimetry, highlight recent advances in the dynamical measurement using compact cold atom gravimeters and discuss the associated technological challenges. In the future, with the maturity of its application in dynamical measurement or civil engineering and the innovation in atom interferometry theory, atomic gravimetry could play a more and more important role in our life.",Jiang B.; Long J.; Li C.; Chen L.; Chen S.,Journal,"Scientia Sinica: Physica, Mechanica et Astronomica",2021-01-01,Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at the Microscale;University of Science and Technology of China;Shanghai Research Center for Quantum Sciences,Atom interferometry ;  Compact gravimeters ;  Dynamical survey
Understanding the urbanization impacts of high-speed rail in China,"Advances in transport technology have been shown to play a vital role in urban development over millennia. From the engineering and pavement innovations of the Roman road network to the aerospace breakthroughs that enabled jet aircraft, cities have been reshaped by the mobility changes resulting from new designs for moving people and goods. This article explores the urbanization impacts of High-Speed Rail's introduction in China, which has built the world's largest High-Speed Rail network in record time. Since High-Speed Rail was launched in Japan in 1964, this technology has worked to reshape intercity travel as a revolutionary transportation alternative. High-Speed Rail has developed steadily across Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland during the 1970s and 1980s. It expanded to Russia, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Sweden in the 1990s. In the 21st century, China began developing High-Speed Rail on an unprecedented scale, and now has a national network that is longer than the totality of the rest of the world's High-Speed Rail operations combined. China's High-Speed Rail operation is exerting a transformative influence on urban form and function. This article synthesizes secondary research results to analyse the impacts of HSR on urbanization. These effects include population redistribution, urban spatial expansion and industrial development. We offer a typology that considers the urban effects of High-Speed Rail at three spatial levels: the station area, the urban jurisdiction, and the regional agglomeration. When organized through our typology, research findings demonstrate that High-Speed Rail influences urban population size, urban spatial layout and industrial development by changing the accessibility of cities. We highlight the processes by which High-Speed Rail ultimately affects the urbanization process for people, land use, and industrial development. However, High-Speed Rail's impacts on urbanization are not always positive. While leveraging the development opportunity enabled by High-Speed Rail, governments around the world should also avoid potential negative impacts by drawing lessons from the experience of High-Speed Rail's rapid deployment in China.",Perl A.; Deng T.; Correa L.; Wang D.; Yan Y.,Journal,Archives of Transport,2021-01-01,Taiyuan Normal University;Shanghai University of Finance and Economics;Simon Fraser University,China ;  High-speed rail ;  Industry ;  Land ;  Population ;  Urbanization
Application of the generic variation operator in the model of PGE - Product generation engineering onto the element types of properties and functions of technical systems,"In analogy to the research field of epigenetics in biology, engineering research in the Model of PGE - Product Generation Engineering according to Albers is concerned with the detection of phenomena of variation that can be observed not only in physical embodiment, but also in other system elements such as properties and functions. Based on the gathered findings and insights of the structuring of elements of a new product generation or the reference system and an understanding of the set of elements, the generic variation operator in the Model of PGE is applied onto the properties and functions of technical systems. The application of the generic variation operator supports the product developer in identifying the alterations of the system elements. In addition, linking the variation types of properties, functions, and physical elements initially reveals preliminary patterns of ""element-spanning""variation. Further research should focus on systematically linking the carry -over and new development shares of properties, functions and physical elements, whereby insights on the innovation potential of a product generation and the underlying development risk may be evaluated.",Albers A.; Fahl J.; Hirschter T.; Rapp S.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2021-01-01,Karlsruher Institut für Technologie,Automotive Product Development Practice ;  Element Types ;  Functions ;  Generic Variation Operator ;  P GE - Product Generation Engineering ;  Properties ;  Set of Elements
Artificial intelligence in engineering: Evolution of virtual product development in the context of medical device industry,"In this paper a framework is introduced to elicit requirements of Artificial Intelligence (AI) towards the System Model in order to support engineers in Virtual Product Development (VPD). The framework supports to shape the evolution necessary in system modelling to provide the right data in the right quality for AI. Depending on the business benefit that a company wants to realize, AI can provide capabilities and solutions to be implemented in VPD. Therefore, differing requirements need to be fulfilled for each business benefit that a company pursues. This framework is applied in a case study in the Medical Device Industry, where a marked leader wants to improve their capability to create innovations by automatically increasing their market knowledge. Therefore, a Natural Language Processing system is applied to automatically enhance the company knowledge base with an external source. This is realized in an initial prototype by analyzing Tender Documents and automatically connecting the new knowledge generated to the company internal knowledge in the system model. This paper is part of research activities within the Research and Development department of a global Medical Device Company.

Digital Technologies For Personnel Management: Implications For Open Innovations,"Personnel management in the digital industry has become inextricably linked with open innovation, as a greater emphasis is placed on finding talents best suited for a specific company and on controlling the situation in the rapidly changing environment. In this context, it is important to bridge the current gap in the literature, understanding how introducing innovative approaches in personnel management allows to support simultaneous complex processes, finding the parameters required for performance assessment and forecasting. The goal of the article is to consider multiple options of personnel management metrics, outlining their strengths, weaknesses and opportunities, and present the suitable dashboard with the most appropriate indicators. We propose an innovative tool that can help managers at different levels to effectively handle diverse scenarios of personnel performance. We have formulated the criterion for choosing most appropriate innovative personnel management digital dashboard, investigating various metrics and KPI which should be chosen to assess the company’s current situation in terms of personnel management. We present an example of the dashboard, which is a ready solution that can be adapted to the specific company environment. A detailed modification of the proposed digital dashboard for personnel management based on the fundamental approach to engineering incorporating open innovation could be a topic for a further research.",Barykin S.; Kapustina I.; Valebnikova O.; Valebnikova N.; Kalinina O.; Sergeev S.; Camastral M.; Putikhin Y.; Volkova L.,Journal,Academy of Strategic Management Journal,2021-01-01,Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation;Gazprom;Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University,Digital Dashboard ;  Innovation ;  Personnel Management
Research on the Relationship between Data Empowerment and Service Innovation Capability of Logistics Platform Enterprise,"Based on the application of big data, this paper constructed a theoretical model focusing on the mechanism of data empowerment on the service innovation capability of logistics platform enterprises, with value cocreation as the mediating variable and environmental dynamism as the moderating variable. The research hypothesis was empirically tested based on the results obtained from the questionnaire survey. The results demonstrate that data empowerment can promote the value co-creation between logistics platform enterprises and users, and value co-creation is an important factor to promote the service innovation capability of logistics platform enterprises. Meanwhile, the moderating variable of environmental dynamism is found to inhibit the interaction between cooperation and service innovation capability. The findings expand the theoretical research on data empowerment and raise important inspiration for practical activities of logistics platform enterprises.",Zhang Y.; Hu M.,Journal,Mathematical Problems in Engineering,2021-01-01,Guangdong University of Foreign Studies,
The deployment dynamics and multistability of tubular fluidic origami,"This research for the first time investigates the deployment dynamics of fluidic origami tubular structures, driven by internal pressurization using working liquid or air. Utilizing fluidics is attractive given that it is readily available in many engineering systems and is easy to realize and control, and embedding it in tubular origami is an effective innovation to create various advanced functionalities, which are not achievable in traditional origami even with adaptive materials. Despite fluidic origami's potential as a promising inflatable deployable structure, the dynamics of its deployment have not been explored. This research advances the state of the art with intriguing new findings that have not been observed in previous studies and cannot be derived with traditional quasi-static analysis. In this investigation, the origami tube is constructed using the Miura origami pattern with the ends of the tube sealed and fluidic pressure applied in the chamber. We develop a structural dynamic model based on the bar-and-hinge approach, where the panel flexibility and inertia effects are captured. We restrict movement on one end of the tube in the axial direction and release the other end to move freely. We derive discretized non-dimensionalized equations of motion and apply equivalent nodal forces on the facets to emulate the effect of internal fluidic pressure. Through quasi-static analyses, the tube's deployed configuration is shown as a function of the fluidic field pressure. It is illustrated that given the same pressure level, the structure will deploy to a lesser length/volume as the crease folding stiffness increases, and that the effect of the variation in panel deformation stiffness is not as significant. We then perform analysis of the tubular structure's dynamic deployment process, by assuming a space-invariant pressure field first applied as a step function in time. The results reveal that the internal pressure level can effectively influence the structure's transient response during deployment and its final configuration. Increasing the pressure level may increase the tube oscillation frequency, and may also cause the system behavior to change from overdamped to underdamped. These results indicate that adjusting the fluidic field pressure would vary the system effective stiffness and damping ratio properties, and thus would affect the tube's transient dynamic response during deployment. Additionally, the multistability landscape of the fluidic tubular origami will further enrich the deployment dynamics. Under certain values of the fluidic pressure, the tubular structure exhibits significant global bending motion, and settles at a distorted stable equilibrium configuration with large transverse deformation. By applying the fluidic pressure as a ramp function in time, we show that through controlling the pressurization rate, the tube will possess different transient behaviors and settle at different stable configurations. Overall, this investigation enables a deeper understanding of the physics behind the dynamics of tubular origami deployment utilizing internal pressure and pave the way for potential applications of fluidic origami-based structures, such as space boom, morphing surfaces, soft robotics, and many others.",Xia Y.; Filipov E.; Wang K.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,2021-01-01,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",Deployment ;  Dynamics ;  Fluidic origami ;  Miura origami ;  Origami
Study of engineering talent cultivation in emerging engineering education,"The concept of New Engineering Education (NEE) is essential to reforming higher education for engineering talents in China. However, the theoretical system and the application of it are not complete as NEE is a newly proposed concept. This paper adopts textual and comparative analysis methods to study NEE’s development in China. It suggests that the developing path, innovation paradigm, and theoretical system of NEE should be studied from the perspective of talent cultivation. The research finds that two key issues should be firmly grasped: “new demand” of industrial development and “new quality” of talent cultivation. Besides, three major integrations should be underlined including the integration between traditional majors and interdisciplinary technology, the theoretical teaching and practical education, the knowledge transfer and application inquiry. Therefore, a new engineering talent cultivation model should be built featuring “three major reforms” including the reform of curriculum structure, teaching staff and educational platform.",Zhou Y.; Zheng F.,Journal,Transformations in Business and Economics,2021-01-01,Nanjing Institute of Technology,Engineers ;  Interdisciplinary training ;  New engineering education ;  Reform ;  Talent cultivation

A Cloud-Based Decision Support System to Support Decisions in Sow Farms,"In the pig farming industrial sector, innovation is a crucial factor in maintaining competitiveness. On the research side, there exists a large body of models and decision analysis tools that too often do not reach the end-user. In this chapter, we propose a software-as-a-service based on a cloud-based Decision Support System architecture that should overcome the main adoption barriers spotted in the literature. The service proposed takes advantage of existing herd management models feed with historical farm data and economic parameters recorded by the most popular farm management software used by pig companies. The approach includes a sow farm model and offers a set of analytic tools to help farmers in making better strategic, tactical and operational decisions based on their own data. This chapter highlights the advantages of optimization and simulation models hosted in a cloud computing platform to deliver a service of knowledge discovering and data analytics to sow farms. The success in adoption depends on the added value and usability through software integration with current management tools used by pig producers. Preliminary results show that the proposed service helps pig managers to make better supervision of sows and to obtain the competitive advantages of using complex mathematical models in a practical, flexible and transparent way.",Mateo J.; Florensa D.; Pagès-Bernaus A.; Plà-Aragonès L.; Solsona F.; Kristensen A.,Book Series,Lecture Notes on Data Engineering and Communications Technologies,2021-01-01,Universitat de Lleida;Københavns Universitet,
Re-engineering The Clinical Research Enterprise in Response to COVID-19: The Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) experience and proposed playbook for future pandemics,"The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the clinical research enterprises at the 60 Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) Hubs throughout the nation. There was simultaneously a need to expand research to obtain crucial data about disease prognosis and therapy and enormous limitations on conducting research as localities and institutions limited travel and person-to-person contact. These imperatives resulted in major changes in the way research was conducted, including expediting Institutional Review Board review, shifting to remote interactions with participants, centralizing decision-making in prioritizing research protocols, establishing biobanks, adopting novel informatics platforms, and distributing study drugs in unconventional ways. National CTSA Steering Committee meetings provided an opportunity to share best practices and develop the idea of capturing the CTSA program experiences in a series of papers. Here we bring together the recommendations from those papers in a list of specific actions that research sites can take to strengthen operations and prepare for similar future public health emergencies. Most importantly, creative innovations developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic deserve serious consideration for adoption as new standards, thus converting the painful trauma of the pandemic into “post-traumatic growth” that makes the clinical research enterprise stronger, more resilient, and more effective.",Coller B.; Buse J.; Kimberly R.; Powderly W.; Zand M.,Journal,Journal of Clinical and Translational Science,2021-01-01,Rockefeller University;University of Rochester Medical Center;UNC School of Medicine;Washington University in St. Louis;UAB Department of Medicine,clinical research ;  COVID-19 ;  CTSA ;  pandemic ;  translational research
ICT Enabled TVET Education: A Systematic Literature Review,"Economies of the world and workforce level of skills are changing rapidly. Industrial revaluations and knowledge economies have raised the demand for a knowledgeable and digitally equipped skilled workforce. Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) is an educational stream that provides vocational skills to youth and produces a skilled workforce for the industry. The role of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in the TVET pedagogy, training delivery, teachers training, curriculum, and labs is need of the day to meet current era challenges. In the TVET education training cycle, the level of ICT enablement is required to be reviewed. This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) evaluates literature for innovation of ICT in TVET education for the last ten years. This study aims to identify and present ICT-based technology innovations, research, and applications used in TVET training cycle system components/functional areas to identify gaps for future research directions/agenda. This gap identification will help (i) TVET training institutes to upgrade their teachers, curriculum, labs and, equipment, (ii) policymakers to devise technology-oriented skilled workforce development policies, (iii) to provide guidelines to industry, researchers, and academics to focus on gaps to address future challenges of workforce development. Based on the search string, we found 2,445 relevant documents and after applying quality assurance and inclusion/exclusion criteria, finally, 134 documents were selected for the study and analyzed. The result of this systematic literature review identifies that ICT technologies and application dispersion into TVET training cycle system components/functional areas is very low particularly in monitoring and evaluation, career guidance and job placement, trainee’s assessment, and teacher’s training.

Modern trends in development of PDC-type drilling tools,"Relevance. Requirements for rock cutting tools are to ensure high mechanical speed, resource, wide range of application and low material costs for its purchase. In other words, the drilling tool must be durable, wear-resistant, and made of relatively inexpensive material. Advances in the synthesis of polycrystalline diamond and the manufacture of high-strength cutters from it have significantly expanded the capabilities of drilling tool manufacturers. Synthetic superhard material began to be used in the manufacture of cutting elements and the entire working part of rock cutting tools. Innovations in materials science have made it possible to produce PDC cutters of various shapes, sizes, strengths, which is especially important when creating bits, crowns and drill heads with combined weapons. As is known, the composition and sintering conditions of the composite affect the properties of the resulting PDC cutter blank. By changing the strength parameters and the geometry of the PDC cutting elements, taking into account the field of application of the tool, you can achieve the best effect of rock breaking. Thus, when creating a new drilling rock cutting tool, it is relevant to combine knowledge and skills in the field of chemistry, materials science and design, which will lead to obtaining a promising rock cutting tool. The aim of the research is to determine the directions of improving the PDC-type drilling tool, namely, the possibilities of materials science in the field of sintering of superhard PDC material, the advantages of using a composite of various structure in the engineering of new designs of PDC-type drilling tools.

A solution in search of problems: a cognitive tool for solution mapping to promote divergent thinking,"Engineering design processes are often defined as beginning with a problem and diverging to generate possible solutions; however, design processes can start with a newly developed technological solution, followed by a divergent search for potential problem applications it can solve, termed ‘solution mapping'. Building on previous research where engineering practitioners described their successful strategies for solution mapping, we created a tool to support solution mapping and tested its impact with engineering students. In a single session, graduate and advanced undergraduate engineering students were presented with a novel technology and worked to identify potential problem applications for it. Comparing students using the Solution Mapping Design Tool to two control groups, more diverse problem applications were produced when using the tool. Considering diverse options is an important feature of design processes shown to promote creativity and innovation. With this successful proof of concept, future work on solution mapping will identify how to support engineers seeking problem applications by making use of new technologies.",Lee J.; Daly S.; Huang-Saad A.; Rodriguez G.; DeVries Q.; Seifert C.,Journal,Journal of Engineering Design,2021-01-01,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor;California State University, Fullerton","Creativity and innovation ;  Design education ;  Design education, descriptive models of the design process ;  Design education, types of design ;  Design theory and research methodology, creative education ;  Design theory and research methodology, problem solving techniques"

Efficiency Evaluation of Green Technology Innovation of China's Industrial Enterprises Based on SBM Model and EBM Model,"The industrial revolution has brought a leap in productivity; however, some severe ecological environment and resource problems are coming out with the development of industrialization. To achieve sustainable development of social economy, green technology innovation emerges in response to the proper time and conditions. In this context, the correct approach to measure the efficiency of green technology innovation in China's industrial enterprises is an important research topic. Based on existing studies, this paper divides innovation activities into two stages based on the innovation value chain and constructs a two-stage evaluation index system including all kinds of undesirable outputs transferred from negative externalities of the ecological environment. To evaluate green technology innovation efficiency, SBM and EBM network DEA models are applied to conduct empirical analysis from the perspective of time and space. This paper also calculates the efficiency values based on the SBM model and the EBM model, respectively, and compares the differences between them. The results show that the efficiency value of the achievement transformation stage is significantly higher than that of technology development stage; there are noticeable gaps in the efficiency of green technology innovation between different regions of China.

Actionable strategy framework for digital transformation in AECO industry,"Purpose: The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) holds the potential to improve capabilities- and technology-based innovation, which will enable breakout for architectural, engineering, construction and operation and maintenance (AECO) companies, for international competitiveness. Though the top management of such companies is convinced on the utility of the applications, they are unsure on the strategy of implementing the same. The objective of this research is to suggest a strategy framework for digital transformation of the AECO value chain. Design/methodology/approach: The nascent level of research on 4IR in construction necessitated the adoption of the integrative review methodology for the study. Extensive literature review of research on strategy and 4IR has been utilized to establish the validity of the first two pillars, namely “a strategy of simple rules in a complex environment; and deployment of dynamic capabilities.” The validation of a construct for the third pillar of “confluence of change and continuity forces” has been achieved via hypothesis testing of data obtained through a questionnaire survey. Findings: The present study has integrated three diverse ideas of strategy, named as the pillars, to facilitate sustainable digital transformation. Within the third pillar, top three continuity forces which offer resistance to change are organization culture, existing delivery processes and networks, and existing standard operating procedures. On the other hand, the leading drivers of change are needs of competitiveness; global industry trends and the advent of new technologies/innovations. Research limitations/implications: This provides a practical approach to operationalize digital transformation of the AECO at an organization level. The validation relied on opinion and perspectives of a sample frame in the Indian context, which was its limitation. Originality/value: This paper suggests a strategy framework of three pillars to help address specific strategy dilemmas during implementation of digital transformation of particular organizations in AECO. The study contributes to both theory and practice by helping leaders of AECO companies, associations, policymakers and the academia to strategize transformations successfully.",Bhattacharya S.; Momaya K.,Journal,"Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management",2021-01-01,Shailesh J.

Application of Computer Simulation Optimization Algorithm in Waste Treatment of Drilling Engineering,"The existing computer technology is used to conduct an in-depth study and analysis of drilling waste treatment, and the results are analyzed by computer simulation optimization algorithms. Based on the system theory, we define the research system, combine the unique characteristics of the technological innovation mechanism of drilling waste treatment, and use the internal and external factors affecting the technological innovation dynamics of drilling waste treatment, such as drilling waste treatment capacity, from the current actual situation. On this basis, factor analysis is used to analyze the factors affecting technological innovation dynamics from both internal and external aspects of the system, establish a system model of technological innovation dynamics of drilling waste disposal, and give the initial values of the simulation model. This will reduce the pollution of the environment and enhance the competitiveness of enterprises. Drilling waste treatment technology is getting increased attention, but at this stage, there is no suitable technology innovation mechanism for drilling waste treatment. Through the simulation trend chart obtained by sensitivity analysis, the key factors in the system are found, and the innovation power mechanism of drilling waste treatment technology is constructed, which provides a basis for the formulation of enterprise technological innovation strategies and the development of technological innovation activities.

Analysis of Financing Risk and Innovation Motivation Mechanism of Financial Service Industry Based on Internet of Things,"It is of practical significance to introduce the Internet of Things technology into the financial service industry and find the driving factors and mechanisms of financial innovation to accelerate the promotion of financial innovation. This article starts from the perspective of banks and other supply chain financial institutions, takes mainstream trading products in the commodity trading market as the research object, uses the LA-VAR model, and fully considers the market price fluctuations and liquidity factors of supply chain financial inventory products. It analyzes the theoretical basis of the continuous innovation of rural financial products. On the basis of analyzing the basic characteristics and types of rural financial product innovation, we explore the connotation of sustainable innovation of rural financial products, clarify the evaluation criteria, and lay a theoretical foundation for continuous dynamic evaluation. Based on technical innovation evaluation theoretical models such as Schumpeter's innovation model, technical specifications-technological track model, and NR relationship model market, we analyze the innovation elements of rural financial products from the external and internal aspects of innovation and discuss the relationship between the factors. The interaction mechanism of rural financial products has established a dynamic mechanism model for the continuous innovation of rural financial products. A fuzzy comprehensive evaluation was made on the continuous innovation power of financial service industry products in a certain area. Using a combination of remote surveys and on-site visits, a questionnaire survey was conducted on financial service industry institutions in a certain region's financial system. Each survey object was required to conduct 120 × 1067 index comparisons and use the data after processing the arithmetic average Matlab carries out the objective processing of programming. The results show that the LA-VAR model with liquidity indicators can measure the liquidity risk well and more comprehensively evaluate the risk of the inventory pledge financing model. According to the index weights determined by AHP, the development of the financial service industry will be promoted in a targeted manner from the internal construction of financial institutions and the optimization of the external innovation environment.",Li L.; Li H.,Journal,Complexity,2021-01-01,Beijing Forestry University,

Divergent Creativity for Requirement Elicitation Amid Pandemic: Experience from Real Consulting Project Go out of the building with a mask and talk with the customer from 2 meter distance-How to foster creativity,"Pandemic situations impact the ability of the startups to identify the product features that have match with market needs; the activity that requires direct interaction with the customers at the same physical space. Online tools can overcome this limitation, but early stage startups have too limited resources and lack of access to the potential customers, which make their online interactions quite limited. The divergent creativity is required to identify the Requirement Elicitation methods and tools that could help startups to identify product/market fit with limited same physical space interaction with customers. The open innovation involving academia, experts and researchers could help startups to get access to the market needs. This paper reports one such consulting experience of the author with the Madrid (Spain) based startup which successfully identified its market in pandemic time through market research driven by secondary studies, primary research involving potential clients (or users) through online means and limited interactions at the same physical space. Daily brainstorming with a team of researchers, experts and professors helped to generate divergent ideas about identifying markets amid pandemic and testing them in real context that proved to be successful for the startup.",Gupta V.; Fernandez-Crehuet J.,Conference Proceeding,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2021-01-01,Universidad Politécnica de Madrid;Fachhochschule Nordwestschweiz FHNW,Coronavirus ;  Creativity. ;  Pandemic ;  Requirement Engineering ;  Startup-Academia partnerships ;  Startups
The social nature of technology fixes,"In this paper we argue that concerns about ‘technological fixes’ are often misguided because people misunderstand the basic concept, which is both value neutral and fundamentally about social issues rather than properly technical ones. After analysing and expanding the concept of a technological fix, these insights are applied to several cases, including an example from software engineering. We contend that decision­making processes involved with technological solutions and innovations need to build in more reflective components sensitive to basic human behaviour in order to be more successful.",Hight M.; Norbisrath U.,Journal,Proceedings of the Estonian Academy of Sciences,2021-01-01,Hampden-Sydney College;Institute of Computer Science,Philosophy of engineering ;  Philosophy of technology ;  Software engineering ;  Technology fixes

Ocean Energy for Ocean Worlds,"Energy systems generating power from ocean waves, currents, tides, and thermal and salinity gradients are being developed to power oceanographic instrumentation and autonomous vehicles in Earth's oceans. Exploration missions enabled or extended with in-situ energy harvesting on Earth may be similar to those on extra-terrestrial ocean worlds including mapping, biogeochemical sampling, acoustic monitoring, searching for building blocks of life, and physical oceanographic characterization. With the addition of ocean energy available at the point of observation, data can be collected on larger spatial and temporal scales, enabling more comprehensive missions on other worlds. Power resource characteristics (e.g., current speed and variability) will similarly need to be assessed. Earth and extra-terrestrial ocean missions share vast technical challenges including high expense, need for advanced autonomy, ability to survive in the harshest environments, and limited communications or opportunities for intervention. Marine energy systems may be the only option for in-situ generation in certain scenarios (e.g., under a thick layer of ice) or advantageous over onboard energy storage options that may interfere with the natural environment (e.g., radioisotope thermoelectric generators). This work provides an overview of existing marine energy technology pertaining to ocean observations, highlights emerging research and development and new funding and program initiatives, explores similarities in mission requirements between terrestrial and extra-terrestrial applications, and suggests innovation pathways towards enabling high-value ocean world exploration powered by ocean energy.",Cavagnaro R.; Spence H.; Schmaus C.; McShane B.; Copping A.,Conference Proceeding,"Earth and Space 2021: Space Exploration, Utilization, Engineering, and Construction in Extreme Environments - Selected Papers from the 17th Biennial International Conference on Engineering, Science, Construction, and Operations in Challenging Environments",2021-01-01,United States Department of Energy;Pacific Northwest National Laboratory,
Procedure to Identify Actors that Revitalize an Incipient Defense Industry Under the Five-Helix Approach,"The development of any defense industry requires identifying actors, both public and private, whose efficient interrelation stimulates a sustainable innovation model that allows reducing exogenous technological dependence. In the work, a procedure was established for the identification of the actors associated with an incipient defense industry, as is the case of the Ecuadorian one, with the approach of the quintuple helix model. The procedure is based on the application of the prospective MACTOR method, a tool that allows analyzing stakeholder strategies and establishing future recommendations. Important conceptual nodes were identified in the subject of study, such as the linking of public and private actors, cooperation between them, the role of public policies and spending on R+D+i, the development of an innovation model that considers agents such as government, academia, industry, society and environmental agencies/organizations. The results of the work made it possible to delineate future research actions associated with the application of the procedure in order to identify for the Ecuadorian case the fundamental actors, their strategies, possible alliances, conflicts and recommendations for the future.",Fernández Lorenzo A.; Paredes Calderón D.; Parra Cárdenas H.,Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2021-01-01,Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas ESPE,Actors ;  Defense and security sector ;  Defense industry ;  Innovation ;  Quintuple helix ;  Strategic prospective ;  Strategy
Analysis of the Social Identity Measurement of the Enterprise Founders in Ecuador,"The social identity of the founders focuses on how individuals identify and understand themselves as entrepreneurs, it has been shown that the intellectual abilities and nature of leaders are manifested in the creation and management of their companies and the results that these get. The research defines a model adjusted by structural equations to measure the types of Darwinian, Missionary and Communitarian social identity of companies’ founders in Ecuador. In the application of the model, it is evidenced that there is an inclination of these founders towards missionary identity, followed by Darwinian, as pure identities, thus a significant percentage of the hybrid Darwinian/missionary is also obtained as a result (13.2%). It is evident that there is no significant difference between the variables gender, age, professional training and company sector, and the type of identity. Except between the missionary identity and the formation of the founder. The study shows the importance of relating the type of social identity with relevant business results such as the capacity for innovation in companies.",Maya Carrillo M.; Ramos V.; Ruiz W.; Sempertegui C.,Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2021-01-01,Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas ESPE;Universidad de las Americas - Ecuador;Escuela Politécnica Nacional;Universidad Nacional de Colombia Medellin,Founders ;  Model ;  Social identity

Faculty and Trainee Perceptions of NSF I-Corps Technology Commercialization Training,"At universities, interest is increasing in expanding entrepreneurship education opportunities for both engineering faculty and students, with the goals of improving the professional skills of students and accelerating research commercialization by faculty. However, questions remain about the effective design of entrepreneurship education initiatives for both of these two audiences. Comparing the experiences of trainees (including primarily graduate students and postdoctoral researchers) and faculty in entrepreneurship training will better allow for meeting the distinct needs of these two communities. In this analysis, structural equation modeling was used to examine differences between trainee and faculty perceptions of usefulness, instructional climate, and workload in the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps (I-Corps) entrepreneurship training program. Data were drawn from the publicly available VentureWell I-Corps dataset, including precourse, postcourse, and longitudinal follow-up survey responses from 722 faculty and 781 trainee participants. Results show that trainees perceived the training program as more useful to their careers than did faculty, although no differences in perceived usefulness to one's research program were found. Trainees also perceived instructional climate more negatively and experienced a greater workload.",Epstein A.; Huang-Saad A.; Duval-Couetil N.,Journal,IEEE Engineering Management Review,2021-01-01,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor;Purdue Polytechnic Institute",Entrepreneurship ;  Faculty Development ;  Graduate Education ;  Motivation ;  Structural Equation Modeling (Sem) ;  Survey ;  Technology Commercialization
A Matrix for Gamifying Development Workshops,"The interest in potentials of gamification for innovating businesses through collaboration and innovative development in businesses has been an ongoing topic in gamification research for the last decade. This based on the theoretical notion of gamification’s potential to facilitate “third space communication” and games capability to improve user engagement in non-game settings by transforming this space into a “magic circle” of gameplay for innovative thinking. In this paper an initial matrix is presented for discussing the parameters of gamifying development sessions or workshops conducted throughout innovation and development processes. The purpose of the matrix is to visualize the parameters involved in deciding the level of gamification for a workshop setting. Thus, a tool for identifying a balance in implementing game mechanics, one that can serve to support and facilitate innovative processes rather than purely creating and playing a game for its own sake. Therefore, through this paper the parameters of the matrix and gamifying facilitation of innovative development processes through gameplay, is discussed and presented. This is followed by the exemplification of use and application of the gamification matrix through four gamified workshops.",Madsen K.; Rasmussen M.,Book Series,"Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering, LNICST",2021-01-01,Aalborg University Business School,Gamification ;  Innovation ;  Workshop design
Blockchain applications in agribusiness: A systematic review,"Blockchain is a technology that can be applied in different sectors to solve various problems. As a complex system, agribusiness presents many possibilities to take advantage of blockchain technology. The main goal of this paper is to identify the purposes for which blockchain has been applied in the agribusiness sector, for which a PRISMA-based systematic review was carried out. The scientific literature corpus was accessed and selected from Elsevier’s Scopus and ISI of Knowledge’s Web of Science (WoS) platforms, using the PRISMA protocol procedures. Seventy-one articles were selected for analysis. Blockchain application in agribusiness is a novel topic, with the first publication dating from 2016. The technological development prevails more than blockchain applications since it has been addressed mainly in the Computer Sciences and Engineering. Blockchain applications for agribusiness management of financial, energy, logistical, environmental, agricultural, livestock, and industrial purposes have been reported in the literature. The findings suggest that blockchain brings many benefits when used in agribusiness supply chains. We concluded that the research on blockchain applications in agribusiness is only at an early stage, as many prototypes are being developed and tested in the laboratory. In the near future, blockchain will be increasingly applied across all economic sectors, including agribusiness, promoting greater reliability and agility in information with a reduced cost.

Advancing medical technology innovation and clinical translation via a model of industryenabled technical and educational support: Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute’s Medical Technology Advance Program,"The success rate for translation of newly engineered medical technologies into clinical practice is low. Traversing the “translational valleys of death” requires a high level of knowledge of the complex landscape of technical, ethical, regulatory, and commercialization challenges along a multi-agency path of approvals. The Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute developed a program targeted at increasing that success rate through comprehensive training, education, and resourcing. The Medical Technology Advance Program (MTAP) provides technical, educational, and consultative assistance to investigators that leverages partnerships with experts in the health products industry to speed progress toward clinical implementation. The training, resourcing, and guidance are integrated through the entire journey of medical technology translation. Investigators are supported through a set of courses that cover bioethics, ethical engineering, preclinical and clinical study design, regulatory submissions, entrepreneurship, and commercialization. In addition to the integrated technical and educational resources, program experts provide direct consultation for planning each phase along the life cycle of translation.

Boosting Supplier Innovations by Implementing New Promotor Roles,"Successfully implemented innovations in firms often benefit from a set of corporate actors who promote such innovations. This is the essence of promotor theory. However, this theory was designed almost five decades ago, when most innovations were still generated internally in a firm's laboratory. In most cases today, suppliers external to the firm play a crucial role in implementing innovations. The following question thus arises: Do such externally generated innovations actually require the buying firm to have a set of promotors of its own? Relying on a benchmark and the World Café method, our research concludes that a new set of promotors tailored to supplier innovation is needed: the supplier vision promotor; the customer promotor; and a diplomatic promotor. Establishing a dedicated team of promotors may be a key to boost innovations coming from suppliers.",Goldberg J.; Schiele H.,Journal,IEEE Engineering Management Review,2021-01-01,Universiteit Twente,Innovation champion ;  innovation implementation ;  innovation promotor ;  supplier innovation
Procurement and Contractual Choices for Engineer-to-Order Supply Chains,"Complex projects are increasingly collaborative, involving ever greater numbers of multiple organizations, while also seeking to deliver high levels of innovation. To gain insight into how supply chain management might be developed to better support these developments, many have looked to high volume manufacturing to benchmark and seek best practice. Outcomes have often fallen short of expectation: in the construction sector, for instance, productivity and adversarial relationships are still a major cause of concern in many countries. While there have been some successes in transferring technologies and supply chain innovation from high volume manufacturing to engineering intensive sectors, such as construction, shipbuilding, machinery, and capital goods, the more general narrative is of the difficulties that have arisen. We see these difficulties arising from underlying differences between the supply chain types, and have developed a body of knowledge for 'engineer-to-order' situations to better support such sectors. The procurement process is crucial to establishing conditions for success and is typically a major source of concern for the supply chain. Hence, we summarize the findings of a research project that focused on developing the principles required for procurement excellence and to structure the possible contractual choices in engineer-to-order supply chains.",Gosling J.; Hewlett B.; Naim M.,Journal,IEEE Engineering Management Review,2021-01-01,Cardiff Business School;Cardiff University;Bill Hewlett Associates Ltd.,Construction ;  contracts ;  engineer-to-order ;  procurement ;  supply chain management
Environmental Implications of the Recycling of End-of-Life Tires in Seismic Isolation Foundation Systems,"The extensive generation of end-of-life (ELT) tires worldwide has resulted in adverse environmental effects and threats to public health and safety including tire fires and leaching of contaminants into the soil environment, groundwater, and surface water. It is becoming imperative to investigate more sustainable and large-scale opportunities for the reuse of ELTs. One novel engineering solution is their reuse in structures with enhanced seismic resilience. This is particularly important in countries such as New Zealand and Japan where past earthquakes have caused widespread damage and socioeconomic loss. Research is being carried out to investigate a seismic-resilient engineered foundation-soil system for low-to-medium-density low-rise residential housing composed of a layer of granulated tire rubber (GTR) and gravel, and a flexible rubber–concrete raft foundation. It is essential to ensure that such innovations do not result in long-term negative impacts on the environment as tires contain hazardous compounds used in their manufacturing and the steel fiber within the tires can leach heavy metals (e.g., zinc, manganese, lead, cadmium). Preliminary batch leaching tests undertaken on (1) GTR and (2) GTR: gravel mixtures (20–40% rubber content by volume) indicated leaching of calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), and potassium (K) which was contributed to the gravel and low levels of zinc (Zn), which were attributed to the tires.",Banasiak L.; Chiaro G.; Palermo A.; Granello G.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering,2021-01-01,University of Canterbury;ESR - Christchurch Science Centre,End-of-life tires ;  Foundation systems ;  Tire leachate ;  Waste tires
"3D Printing in Construction: Current Status, Implementation Hindrances, and Development Agenda","3D printing (3DP) is regarded as an innovation that contributes to automation in civil engineering and offers benefits in design, greenness, and efficiency. It is necessary to objectively analyze the current status and challenges associated with 3DP and identify future research directions to properly understand its construction applications. Previous research has focused more on the technical dimension of 3DP; however, the nontechnical dimension of the technology may hinder its implementation and thus must be paid particular attention to. This study presents a systematic review of the existing literature from both technical and nontechnical dimensions by combining quantitative and qualitative studies. The quantitative study was conducted using scientometric methods. The qualitative study analyzed information, including the technical research status and nontechnical challenges and trends. Two aspects of technical research status are presented, including materials and processes. In addition, nontechnical challenges and trends from the economic, environmental, social, and legislative aspects are proposed. This study provides a comprehensive agenda to advance 3DP in construction and proposes research interests, challenges, and future topics. It is intended to help construction practitioners systematically master existing processes and materials and assess the application degree and necessity of 3DP.",Ning X.; Liu T.; Wu C.; Wang C.,Journal,Advances in Civil Engineering,2021-01-01,Dongbei University of Finance and Economics;Beihang University;Louisiana State University,
Computational thinking and stem in agriculture vocational training: A case study in a greek vocational education institution,"Due to the dynamic nature of the agricultural industry, educators and their institutions face difficult challenges as they try to keep pace with future demands for knowledge and skilled workers. On the other hand, computational thinking (CT) has drawn increasing attention in the field of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education at present and, as advanced technologies and tools emerge, it is imperative for such innovations to be sustained with knowledge and skill among STEM educators and practitioners. The present case study aims to explore the relation between CT, STEM and agricultural education training (AET) in a Greek vocational training institute (IEK), the Agriculture IEK of Metamorfosis city (IEKMC), which is active in agriculture education. The research methodology is utilized according the positivist philosophical approach through data acquisition employing a questionnaire and the quantitative (statistical) analysis of data collected. The sample consists of IEKMC educators and students selected based on simple random sampling. Based on the participants belief that CT and STEM philosophy add value in the learning process, it focuses on the application of knowledge in the real world (students) and problem solving using new technologies (educators). Educators consider “experiments” as the most significant educational tool for problem solving in teaching practice. Students rate Greek Agriculture Education and Training (GAET) higher than educators. However, the participants evaluate GAET very low due to the lack of new innovative teaching methods being introduced. Finally, there is great interest in the implementation of CT and STEM in the European Union (EU) by students and educators.",Chondrogiannis E.; Symeonaki E.; Papachristos D.; Loukatos D.; Arvanitis K.,Journal,"European Journal of Investigation in Health, Psychology and Education",2021-01-01,University of West Attica;Agricultural University of Athens,Agriculture education and training ;  Computational thinking ;  Problem solving ;  STEM

Various versions of integrated ERP-class systems are known. At the same time, we are in the fourth indus-trial revolution. The future is Industry 4.0 and Digital Factory. Industry 4.0 is an overall term for technical innovations and value change organization concepts which revolutionize the industrial production. Currently, the digital technologies change the way production is carried out by generating, transferring and processing of data, and also by analysing large amounts of datasets. There is a problem of the place and significance of logistics, transport and supply chains in the fourth industrial revolution. What is logistics engineering, what methods are suggested to solve the contemporary problems of logistic support of production processes? To whom are the virtual systems dedicated? What rules should be applied by small and medium enterprises (SME)? Is the pressure of virtual world a threat to such companies? Is it possible to design and make real products without virtual manufacturing? Hence, does Logistics 4.0 exist and where is it used? The practice of logistics engineering is applied during the entire system lifecycle by means of interactive processes supporting the anal-yses and research (compromise) for optimization of costs, logistics and efficiency. Surely, it can be said that without the correctly designed and effective logistic processes the contemporary production system could not achieve the required productivity and effectiveness. The article describes the basic tasks of logistics engineering in relation to production com-panies, as well as relations with Industry 4.0. and digital factory. Moreover, a proposal of the author's own algorithms for use in the quest to improve the continuity of flow and of enterprise effectiveness for SME class companies was presented.",MICHLOWICZ E.,Journal,Archives of Transport,2021-01-01,AGH University of Krakow,Industry 4.0 ;  Logistics engineering ;  Production logistics ;  Supply chain
Piston Machines,"Piston machines are the most used power and work machines in the mechanical engineering industry. Piston machines are divided into so-called reciprocating and rotary piston machines. With the first type, a reciprocating motion is transformed to a rotary motion in the case of the power machine and conversely in the case of the working machine. Today, rotary piston machines are almost exclusively used as work machines. Important innovations and intensive research are practiced in particular for the use of piston machines as an internal combustion engine. Therefore, mixture formation and the combustion process, with their consequences in terms of emission and fuel consumption, are in the center of attention.",Tschöke H.; Piacenti V.; Keppy B.; Singh A.; White S.; Kern J.; van Gerpen J.,Book Series,Springer Handbooks,2021-01-01,"University of Idaho;Otto-von-Guericke-Universität Magdeburg;Robert Bosch GmbH;BOSCH, ROBERT LLC",compressors ;  internal combustion engines ;  Piston design ;  reciprocating machines ;  rotary machines
Empathy Instruction Through the Propagation Paradigm: A Synthesis of Developer and Adopter Accounts,"Prior research indicates that empathy can help engineers achieve better outcomes in team-based, design, entrepreneurial, and humanitarian environments. We describe an educational innovation designed to teach engineering students empathic communication skills. Written in the spirit of a propagation (versus dissemination) paradigm, we focus on how the original innovation was adapted to fit into two instructional settings that differed from the first implementation context. We use first person instructor accounts to describe these adaptation processes, including interactions between the developers and the adopters of the innovation, what modifications were necessary to “fit” the innovation into the new settings, and adopter experiences. We conclude with a brief discussion of particularly salient propagation considerations that emerged for the two adopters including, for example, the amount of instructional time available for implementing the empathic communication exercises, and how to achieve student buy-in in different course settings. The two main contributions of this paper are, first, the rich descriptions of how features of the original educational innovation had to be modified to meet the two other settings’ pedagogical goals and, second, an example of how to advance scholarship that supports the propagation of engineering education teaching and learning innovations.",Sochacka N.; Delaine D.; Shepard T.; Walther J.,Journal,Advances in Engineering Education,2021-01-01,"University of Georgia;University of St. Thomas, Minnesota;The Ohio State University",empathy ;  professional skills ;  propagation
Cloud applications adoption: User study survey from industry and academia,"Cloud computing has changed the ways software systems are developed, deployed, and managed. Even though cloud computing could reduce cost, time to market, and increase the scalability of applications and systems, there are some debates about the actual adoption of cloud computing in general and cloud applications in particular by organizations from both, industry and academia, and whether stakeholders of organizations look for them as opportunities or risks. To answer these debates, we conducted a user study that included professionals from industry and academia, with various experience levels and job-roles, to be able to get a common understanding of the real value of cloud computing. In particular, the study included questions about the preferred approach of developing green-field applications and the availability of resources and expertise. In addition, it included questions about the cost of development, maintainability, and operations of cloud applications. The results of the user study are presented and discussed, and we believe that it is promising and could be used as the base of future directions of research and technology innovation.",Kiswani J.; Dascalu S.; Harris F.,Conference Proceeding,EPiC Series in Computing,2021-01-01,College of Engineering,
Key success factors of engineering company (Case of czech engineering industry),"The definition of a successful company is not uniform in the scientific literature, and the determinants of a company’s success can vary from one business sector to another. Based on a study of 16 Czech engineering companies, this paper defines the success of an engineering company as a state when the company achieves the satisfaction and stability of external and internal interest groups (especially employees), contributing to its healthy development, technological expansion and long-term sustainability through marketable products or services and sufficient resources to finance that state. This definition is consistent with the results of studies such as Fortune and White (2006), Zarina et al. (2014), Arcić (2018), Mahanti (2018) or Amuda-Yusuf (2018). In the Czech engineering environment, marketing can generally be considered a key factor, and within the marketing mix, pricing policy and especially product. The breadth and depth of the products provided and their high quality also play a significant role. Furthermore, human resources are a key factor in the success of the Czech engineering company, where the emphasis is placed on the stability and loyalty of employees and their positive attitude to work, and research, development and innovation are mentioned as another key success factor. Surprisingly, financial factors were not listed as the main determinants of success.",Kubíčková L.; Chudá B.,Journal,Journal of East European Management Studies,2021-01-01,Mendelova Univerzita v Brně,Determinants of success ;  Engineering company ;  Key factors of success ;  Success ;  Successful company
Learning specifics of corporate culture development: A study of motor transport masters program graduates,"Within the framework of post-industrial development in the motor industry a new management culture based on corporate values is stimulating change in the system of engineering education. In the evolution of the vehicle servicing businesses, second level higher education graduates, (masters of Engineering) are often employed as line managers. The results of a multi-panel academic study involving stakeholders indicated the need for masters program graduates to be actively engaged in the development of corporate culture and training production staff. This highlighted a new competence for line manager which has previously not given adequate focus – training as a part of operational management activities. This is an innovative feature of the Engineer masters Program training process. This article analyzes the curriculum for teaching corporate culture to production personnel. It also specifies the role of a facilitator to replace an expert teacher and formulates the academic problem of teaching specific didactic tools appropriate for corporate culture development to masters students.",Dorofeev A.; Bukalova G.; Novikov A.,Journal,Education and Self Development,2021-01-01,Orel State University;Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation;HSE University,Corporate culture ;  Didactics ;  Educational innovations ;  Educational research ;  Engineering higher education ;  Masters competencies ;  Production personnel training
Engineering companies and their readiness for Industry 4.0,"Purpose: This case study of the readiness of engineering companies for Industry 4.0 (I4.0) presents how surveyed key figures manage the implementation of I4.0. The research comprised a census of larger and medium-sized engineering companies in the Pilsen region of the Czech Republic. The selected region is characterised by a long industrial tradition and a high concentration of technical and technology-oriented companies. The survey questionnaire monitors a wide range of topics. In this text, the authors present the results only from selected areas. In particular, the authors examined: (1) the use of I4.0 technologies in individual areas, (2) the level of the digital strategy (DS), (3) factors influencing investments in I4.0 technologies, (4) the impact of I4.0 on the workforce and (5) existing threats to I4.0 implementation. The purpose of this paper is to show how key figures with a real impact on the implementation of I4.0 think and act in practice (as opposed to declarations). Design/methodology/approach: In the presented article, thanks to the unique data obtained in the form of a census in the selected, traditionally engineering-oriented Pilsen region, and within the highly industrially oriented Czech Republic, the authors explored the state of readiness of companies for implementation of I4.0. The obtained data allowed the authors to present, in a suitably descriptive way, the current level, with respect to the future, of the planned use of I4.0 principles in the surveyed companies. They monitored not only the state of the adoption process (Industry of 4.0 technologies) compared to the declared proclamations but also which phenomena represent key obstacles. Findings: First, medium-sized companies have barely implemented I4.0, whereas I4.0 is more often implemented in larger companies, especially the so-called DS aspect of I4.0. Furthermore, it appears that larger companies also clearly consider I4.0 more often and see it more significantly as a key success factor. Second, the survey highlighted the fact that customer satisfaction is the determining impetus for the introduction of I4.0. It can be assumed that with an increase in pressure from customers and a decrease in the price of technology, the introduction of I4.0 will increase. The third important finding is that the authors can observe a kind of two-stage flow of innovation in the results. The transformation towards I4.0 is approached by larger companies first, because they are more sensitive to customer satisfaction, are looking for new opportunities, and have greater resources to cover the costly implementation of innovations. Originality/value: In the presented article, thanks to the unique data obtained in the form of a census in the selected, traditionally engineering-oriented Pilsen region, and within the highly industrially oriented Czech Republic, the authors explored the state of implementation of I4.0. The obtained data allowed the authors to present, in a suitably descriptive way, the current level, with respect to the future, of the planned use of I4.0 principles in the surveyed companies.",Váně J.; Kalvas F.; Basl J.,Journal,International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management,2021-01-01,University of West Bohemia,Digital strategy ;  Engineering companies ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Readiness
The Construction and Empirical Research on the Dynamic Evaluation Model of University Science and Technology Output,"We established a model based on the 'Malmquist index' to evaluate the dynamic performance of scientific and technological innovation in seven Chinese universities, which included five categories: changes in pure technical efficiency, changes in production technology, changes in scale efficiency, changes in organizational management performance, and changes in comprehensive efficiency. Seven domestic first-class universities were studied, and empirical analysis was performed based on data related to their scientific and technological innovation during three time periods (2013-2014, 2014-2015, and 2015-2016). Our results demonstrated that the contribution rate for each index was different for each university across the three time periods, and that Chinese universities is gradually transitioning from resource allocation to technical efficiency. In this paper, we explored the transformation from effect to efficiency and static to dynamic in the evaluation of the scientific and technological output of colleges and universities, and constructed systematic and unique multi-evaluation system for the scientific and technological output of universities.",Sun Y.; Yuan X.; Chen Q.,Journal,IEEE Access,2021-01-01,Business School of Sichuan University;Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences;Sichuan University,data envelopment analysis ;  Dynamic performance ;  enhanced Russell measure ;  Malmquist index ;  university science and technology

Embedded System Learning Platform for Developing Economies,"The continual research of electronic embedded system platforms for teaching and learning is of paramount importance. This is to increase the impact on a universities’ ability to lead in technological advancement with goals to enhance innovation and accelerate the concept-to-deployment process. Technological progress in the fields of electronics, wireless communication, cognitive computing, and robotics has caused almost everything which connects to electricity to have a small processor and sensor embedded with itself [1]. Cognitive or Intelligent embedded systems are the ‘core’ of trends such as: reduced energy consumption, deep learning applications, improved security for embedded devices, cloud connectivity and mesh networking, and visualization tools with real time data. This paper is aimed at stimulating design and innovation in electronics education through the rapid prototyping of configurable embedded systems. It also covers remote access functionality is also shown using cloud services. Divided into two parts, this paper gives design examples for both an elevator controller and a Data Acquisition (DAQ) system design. Focus was on the Programmable System on Chip (PSoC) 6 based kit, PSoC Creator software, and Laboratory Virtual Instrumentation Engineering Workbench (LabVIEW) as rapid prototyping and learning platforms for digital and analog system designs. The Universal Digital Block (UDB) editor in PSoC Creator software was used to configure PSoC chip digital blocks and design a Finite State Machine (FSM) based elevator controller, which acquired digital signals and gave corresponding output. LabVIEW was used as a signal analysis tool and was also used to send results for online access and display. The PSoC and LabVIEW ecosystems are utilized here to bring an innovative paradigm into the embedded system design. These two platforms, especially combined with the virtual instrumentation concept, offer configurability and monetary value. This paper shows that the use of these ecosystems for the purpose of electronics education can accelerate learning and bridge the gaps within the online environments that students and universities find increasingly necessary.",Chamunorwa T.; Ursutiu D.; Samoila C.; Modran H.,Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2021-01-01,Universitatea Transilvania din Brașov;Academia Româna;Romanian Academy of Technical Sciences,AFE ;  FPGA ;  FSM ;  LabVIEW ;  PSOC ;  UDB ;  Verilog

Percentage of reducing heat of coco fiber material as a potential isolation of building walls,"This paper was purposed to determine the percentage of coco fibers ability in reducing heat as a potential for insulation building walls with different coco fiber thickness. For the fulfillment of thermal comfort in buildings requires engineering, knowledge and skills and innovation. One way to reduce hot air in the room can be done through walls, thereby reducing the use of air conditioning. The walls need protection and solar heat absorbers which can make the room inside the building have thermal comfort. Based on this, research needs to be done on natural ingredients that can function to reduce heat. Tests carried out on coconut fiber and fiber-free materials. Material without fiber and coco fiber thickness are 1 centimeter, 2 centimeter and 3 centimeter. This coco fiber material is coated with a mixture of cement which also functions as a fiber adhesive. In this case testing by applying heat of 35 Celsius degree to one side of the fiber and measuring the temperature that occurs on the other side of the fiber. The test results found that there was a significant difference between the heat temperature supplied and the heat temperature measured on coco fiber. The thicker the coco fiber material, the greater the percentage of heat that can be reduced. This shows that the coco fiber material has the potential to reduce heat as a wall covering against solar radiation.",Kemala J.; Selamat T.; Rusnardi R.; Rumilla H.,Conference Proceeding,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,2021-01-01,Universitas Negeri Medan,building wall ;  coco fiber ;  insulation ;  percentage ;  reducing heat

From modernization to greening. Geoecology and geosociality,"The article discusses the problem of complex relationships between the two leading areas of scientific, technical and socio-cultural development – modernization and greening. The emergence of new general scientific methodologies and interdisciplinary types of knowledge is largely due to the release of human demiurgic activity to the planetary level. A new interdisciplinary area of research is gaining momentum – geoecology. Natural and socio-humanitarian sciences are involved in the study of geoecological problems. In social epistemology, the problem of interaction between science, technology and society goes to the global level. Philosophical concepts of nature constitute the prerequisites for scientific paradigms, which in the era of global crisis and transformations of public consciousness are multiple and compete with each other. The ideas of scientific vitalism find expression in the life sciences and environmental sciences. Scientific and public discussions on the problems of the new climate regime, pandemic and other global challenges actively influence the formation of new modes of “collective thinking”, involving science, engineering, geopolitics, business, society and culture. Author makes a conclusion about the formation of the methodologies of the ecogeosystem approach, in which living beings, humans, natural environments, the planet as a whole and the surrounding space are considered as open, interacting systems. The common interests of the people of the Earth form a new type of community – geosociality. Humanity is facing a radical value choice – unlimited modernization or reasonable greening? Ideal of a common world or egoism of elites? A turn to an effective ecological worldview is possible only in the context of transformations of public consciousness, restoration of the rights of humanitarian culture and the advanced development o fenvironmentally friendly design.",Gerasimova I.,Journal,Epistemology and Philosophy of Science,2021-01-01,"Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences",A new dialogue with nature ;  Climate-negationism ;  Ecogeosystems ;  Geoecology ;  Geosociality ;  Greening ;  Innovation ;  Mechanicism ;  Methodology of science ;  Modernization ;  Philosophy of nature ;  Social philosophy of science ;  Tradition ;  Vitalism
"Business Administration, Graduate Profile, Social Representations, and Social Relevance: Case of the Universidad Católica de Temuco","The purpose of this study is to identify the underlying social representations of business administration students regarding the concepts of the graduate profile, professional training, and business engineer to subsequently interpret and contrast them with the stated graduate career profile and to review the social relevance thereof. This research study has a cross-sectional design and is descriptive in nature, based on qualitative methodology using the natural semantic networks technique, and the applications were developed in group form. The results show that the concept of the graduate profile does not appear to have been considered in-depth, with participants focusing on peripheral traits and setting aside a large part of what the profile establishes regarding innovation and problem-solving skills in a citizenship education context. With regard to professional training, the concepts associated with this construct are mainly ethics, responsibility, and knowledge, with no mention of the knowledge and skills that are more apposite to the profession. Finally, and in terms of the business engineer stimulus, we note that there is a better understanding of the concept, coinciding more precisely with the business engineering profile UC Temuco wishes to achieve.",Müller-Ferrés P.; Vera-Gajardo N.; Beltrán Véliz J.,Journal,International Journal of Educational Organization and Leadership,2021-01-01,"Universidad Católica de Temuco;Universidad de la Frontera;Universidad Santo Tomas, Santiago",Business Administration ;  Graduate Profile ;  Social Relevance ;  Social Representations
CLONETS-DS - Clock network services-design study strategy and innovation for clock services over optical-fibre networks,"Long-distance time and frequency transfer methods based on optical fibre links have evolved rapidly in recent years, demonstrating excellent performance for frequency transfer and considerable promise for accurate time transfer. Optical fibre links, besides provisioning extreme data transfer rates, are attractive both for very highperformance applications such as optical clock comparisons, basic research or relativistic geodesy, but also for many industrial and societal applications, and they complement and offer an alternative to radio- and satellite-based methods. CLONETS-DS is a European Union-funded research and innovation action intended to facilitate the vision of a sustainable, pan-European optical fibre network for precise time and frequency reference dissemination, by bringing together expertise from national metrology institutes (NMI), academic groups and research infrastructures (RI), research and education networks at the national and European level (NREN, GÉANT) and innovative high-tech small and medium enterprises (SME). The proposed project aims to establish a pan-European time and frequency reference system as a European Resaerch Infrastructure which serves the European science community. It is based on transmitting ultra precise time and frequency information via optical fiber. The proposed project builds on several projects of the European metrology research programmes such as NEAT-FT, OFTEN and TiFOON, the former GN3+ project ICOF, the novel work package 6, Optical Time and Frequency Network (OTFN), of the GN4-3 project of GÉANT and its direct precursor project CLONETS [1]. We now go far beyond previous efforts by designing a sustainable, pan-European, ultra-precise time-and-frequency reference-system available to the European research community. This newly designed European Research Infrastructure will consider user needs, architecture requirements, engineering models and roadmaps, and will develop a sustainability model for the future service, thus strengthening the European research area and its innovative potential.",Vojtěch J.; Altmannová L.; Smotlacha V.; Velc R.; Vohnout R.; Schnatz H.; Liebisch T.; Capone V.; Chiotis T.; Roberts G.; Vicinanza D.; Binczewski A.; Bogacki W.; Turza K.; Pottie P.; Tuckey P.; Calonico D.; Holzwarth R.; Sprenger B.; Číp O.; Rerucha L.; Alonso J.; Vidal E.; García T.; Kodet J.; Schreiber U.; Kusche J.; Meschede D.; Schröder S.; Stellmer S.; Nogas P.; Urbaniak R.; Krehlik P.; Śliwczyński Ł.; Amy-Klein A.; Quintin N.; Seeds A.; Desruelle B.; Lautier-Gaud J.; Ménoret V.; Rabault M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the Annual Precise Time and Time Interval Systems and Applications Meeting, PTTI",2021-01-01,Menlo Systems GmbH;CESNET;Poznańskie Centrum Superkomputerowo‑Sieciowe;Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica;Télécom Paris;Universidad de Granada;University College London;Technische Universität München;AGH University of Krakow;Institute of Scientific Instruments of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic;Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt;University Sorbonne Paris Nord;Universität Bonn;L'Observatoire de Paris;Géant Vereniging;Muquans;Seven Solutions S.L.;Piktime Systems sp. z o.o.,Clock ;  Dissemination ;  Frequency ;  Metrological ;  Network ;  Optical fibre ;  Service ;  Time

The methods and methods of ideological and political education are very old, and students' learning efficiency is very low. How to use ideological and political education technology combined with modern technology for teaching has become a current research hotspot. Based on this background, this article proposes to use a new type of Internet multimedia technology interactive teaching. In the ideological and political network multimedia teaching system, use occasions suitable for IP multicast applications, such as broadcast teaching, group discussions, and on-demand courseware. Among these functions, the IP multicast mechanism is appropriately used. The adoption of the extended conversation node scales each conversation group to a multicast group, and the members of the multicast group represent the participants, which brings convenience and ease of management. Through case study analysis, it can be seen that this method can reduce the burden on the system and improve efficiency, and the number of multicast members is unlimited, which has a very good auxiliary effect on course learning. Through the Internet multimedia technology, the innovation of ideological and political education has been realized, the learning environment of students has been improved, the ways of ideological and political education have been broadened, and the education system has been better optimized.",Yu H.,Journal,Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,2021-01-01,Harbin University of Science and Technology,
Does China's OFDI Successfully Promote Environmental Technology Innovation?,"Environmental technology innovation is a crucial measure of the quality of China's economic development and sustainable environmental protection. Based on the 2009-2017 provincial panel data from China, this article used the modified projection pursuit model to measure the environmental technology innovation capabilities of various regions. Moreover, this article empirically investigates the threshold effect of outward foreign direct investment on China's environmental technology innovation under different intellectual property protection levels. The results are as follows. First, the environmental technology innovation capabilities of China's regions vary significantly, showing an ""east-middle-west""gradient decline trend similar to levels of economic development. Second, outward foreign direct investment has a significant reverse environmental technology innovation effect, but this effect has complex nonlinear characteristics. Third, in the process of outward foreign direct investment affecting environmental technology innovation, intellectual property protection has a significant double threshold effect. As the level of intellectual property protection continues to cross the threshold value, the effect direction of outward foreign direct investment on environmental technology innovation undergoes a sudden change from inhibition to promotion. However, when intellectual property protection is too high, the promotion effect is relatively limited. This paper provides some reference points and insights that should aid in establishing a scientific intellectual property protection system and raising the level of environmental technology innovation.",Han B.,Journal,Complexity,2021-01-01,Shandong University of Science and Technology,
Capability mapping to improve manufacturing network performance: how a factory can target growth,"Purpose: This paper explores growth opportunities for a contract manufacturer (CM), which operates a global virtual manufacturing network (GVMN). The Swiss factory should play a profitable role in the holding's competitive strategy, in spite of lower-cost alternatives within its network. Design/methodology/approach: The study applied a design science method over a period of two years of collaboration with the partner firm to complete three iterations of solution incubation and refinement. Findings: The design artefact is a growth strategy for a CM with independently-managed, heterogeneous sites. A novel capability mapping tool reveals competitive advantage by deploying the GVMN as an order fulfilment system. Engineering and sales are integrated with production to project higher revenue streams in multiple locations including Switzerland. Research limitations/implications: The research expands the operations management (OM) focus on optimization and continuous improvement. Results indicate that local and global manufacturing capabilities can be configured to target network performance, implying that the smile curve flattens in certain GVMN configurations. The exploratory case study is limited by a lack of statistical generalizability and is specific to the contract electronics manufacturing industry. Practical implications: Managing manufacturing as a network can restore feed-forward and feedback loops, which are disrupted by de-verticalization and externalization. The visualization positions a Swiss plant in an inimitable role, serving growth accounts, which require co-development. The order fulfilment strategy and capability maps can be adapted to other GVMNs. Social implications: The study presents an alternative to shuttering high-cost locations using performance improvements instead of protectionist interventions. This could have a material impact on de-industrialization in developed nations like Switzerland. Originality/value: The strategy innovation originates in practice. Its synthesis drew on multiple disciplines to position OM as a strategic lever for competing in global value chains (GVCs). The author finds alternatives to the internationalization logic of cost arbitrage and adds to developed country studies. This is an OM contribution to the broader debate on globalization dominated by the social sciences.",Thakur-Weigold B.,Journal,Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management,2021-01-01,ETH Zürich,Action research ;  Competitive manufacturing ;  Dynamic capabilities ;  Global manufacturing networks ;  Strategy formulation ;  Value chain
"Advances in Neuroscience, Not Devices, Will Determine the Effectiveness of Visual Prostheses","Background: Innovations in engineering and neuroscience have enabled the development of sophisticated visual prosthetic devices. In clinical trials, these devices have provided visual acuities as high as 20/460, enabled coarse navigation, and even allowed for reading of short words. However, long-term commercial viability arguably rests on attaining even better vision and more definitive improvements in tasks of daily living and quality of life. Purpose: Here we review technological and biological obstacles in the implementation of visual prosthetics. Conclusions: Research in the visual prosthetic field has tackled significant technical challenges, including biocompatibility, signal spread through neural tissue, and inadvertent activation of passing axons; however, significant gaps in knowledge remain in the realm of neuroscience, including the neural code of vision and visual plasticity. We assert that further optimization of prosthetic devices alone will not provide markedly improved visual outcomes without significant advances in our understanding of neuroscience.",Abbasi B.; Rizzo J.,Journal,Seminars in Ophthalmology,2021-01-01,Massachusetts Eye and Ear,neural coding ;  neural plasticity ;  neural stimulation ;  Vision restoration ;  visual prosthetic

Transitioning to what? The role of genetic-engineering in New Zealand’s (circular) bioeconomy debates,"Bioeconomy conceptualisations often invoke opportunities to transition towards innovative biotechnologies, bioresources and applications. Clarifying goals has implications for the regulations needed for successful transitions. However, most countries have not yet made final decisions on how to regulate particular bio-innovations: those based on genetic-engineering Certain genetically-modified organisms (GMOs) are still considered high-risk, as full scientific consensus is missing regarding the magnitude/reversibility of potential negative impacts. New Zealand is among these countries; regulations require a case-by-case approval of high-risk GMOs. Key organisations are polarised regarding the ideal kind of bioeconomy. This article draws on literature syntheses, to clarify what features can be regarded as ‘the most distinctive’ for three economic visions currently debated in New Zealand: a natural bioeconomy (BE-1), a genetic-engineering bioeconomy (BE-2) and circular economy (CE). The research objective is to understand what kind of economic transitions are being called-for by key actors in New Zealand. Findings indicate a long-standing BE-2 coalition dominated by science and commercial interests; and a recent CBE-1 coalition already implementing multiple, albeit fragmented, policies. The framework can support similar research in countries still affected by BE-1/BE-2 debates, enabling robust and replicable analyses, longitudinally and comparatively.

"How Companies Can Benefit from Brilliant Failures: Despite the stigma surrounding failure, companies can use failure to learn, pivot, and achieve success—thus failing “brilliantly.”","Overview: Failure is integral to growth and progress, yet companies and individuals struggle to accept it. A company’s culture is one of the most important influences for accepting and learning from failures. We define brilliant failure and distinguish brilliant failures from mistakes, avoidable failures, and epic failures. We identify best practices so companies can understand the value of failure and use what they learn to pivot and achieve success. We present seven major drivers that can impact a company’s ability to fail brilliantly.",Zaharee M.; Abad L.; Chandra P.; Krautkramer C.; Mehlman S.; Schall J.; Taylor K.,Journal,Research Technology Management,2021-01-01,Massachusetts Institute of Technology;Georgia Institute of Technology;Southern New Hampshire University;University of Massachusetts Amherst;Purdue University;Tecnológico de Monterrey;Kimberly-Clark,Failure ;  Innovation culture ;  Innovation process ;  R&D
Lean startup for opportunity exploitation: adoption constraints and strategies in technology new ventures,"Purpose: Most studies investigating the adoption of lean startup (LS) practices by technology new ventures focus on software startups in mature entrepreneurial ecosystems and disregard their applicability for opportunity exploitation in other technological backgrounds. This study contributes to this research stream by exploring how Brazilian technology new ventures (in different technological fields) tentatively adopt LS to exploit opportunities and whether LS is suitable to their emerging economy context. Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopt an exploratory multiple-case study based on qualitative data collection and analysis of nine Brazilian biotechnology, engineering and software startups. Findings: The study shows how technology new ventures tackle the activities of opportunity exploitation – namely, developing a product or service, acquiring human resources, gathering financial resources and setting up the organization – by leveraging LS tools and practices for business model validation; also, it identifies six contextual constraints hindering the systematic adoption of LS and reveals how technology new ventures cope with such constraints in their early stages by integrating LS with complementary strategies and practices. Furthermore, the study reveals that the systematic and comprehensive adoption of LS nurtures the development of an entrepreneurial experimental capability to explore opportunities in a quasi-scientific and hypothesis-driven fashion. Originality/value: The study investigates how Brazilian engineering, biotechnology and software startups exploit opportunities and overcome constraints to business model validation through the combined adoption of LS and complementary strategies and practices and provides a set of propositions to guide future research.",Silva D.; Ghezzi A.; Aguiar R.; Cortimiglia M.; ten Caten C.,Journal,International Journal of Entrepreneurial Behaviour and Research,2021-01-01,Politecnico di Milano;Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,Business model innovation ;  Emerging economy ;  Entrepreneurial experimental capability ;  Lean startup ;  Minimum viable product ;  Technology entrepreneurship
How to Prepare Future Generations for the Challenges in the Raw Materials Sector,"Today some raw materials (RMs) have become essential in the manufacturing of common goods and technologies (i.e., mobile phones, computers, automobiles). Readily accessible raw materials, such as rare earth elements (REEs), indium, neodymium, and others are important to industries and allow the transition towards a low-carbon economy. With the future global resource use projected to double by 2030, addressing raw materials through the entire value chain becomes a priority as well as transferring these ideas to youngsters. Some learning paths for pupils from 10 to 18 years old were developed in the framework of a European project, Raw Matters Ambassadors @Schools (RM@Schools), funded by the Knowledge and Innovation Community “Raw Materials” of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (KIC EIT-RM). It aims to increase among youngsters the understanding of how RMs are needed in modern society and to make careers in RM attractive. Thanks to a strategic European Partnership among the three sides of the knowledge triangle (research, education, and business), RM@Schools has developed learning pathways where different educational approaches are used to foster students’ interest in science and technology, in particular in circular economy, and RM-related topics. The pathways are oriented toward a common goal: students are guided to become Young RM Ambassadors (science communicators) and create a “product” to be communicated outside of the class. By doing this, students develop twenty-first century learning skills such as creativity, critical thinking, awareness of responsibility, and teamwork.",Torreggiani A.; Zanelli A.; Degli Esposti A.; Polo E.; Dambruoso P.; Lapinska-Viola R.; Forsberg K.; Benvenuti E.,Book Series,"Minerals, Metals and Materials Series",2021-01-01,Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche;The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH),Education ;  Raw materials ;  Schools ;  Science dissemination ;  Sustainability
A Novel Framework for Modelling Wheelchairs under the Realm of Internet-of-Things,"Innovations in research labs are driven to global markets by applied, established standard engineering practices, using state-of-the-art research that most likely results in manufacturing highly effective and efficient engineered products. As a technology, that enables assistance to physically challenged people, wheelchairs have attracted researchers across the globe whilst showcasing an increased demand for higher production. However, wheelchairs in relation with the environments implementing Internet-of-things (IoT) devices, have been mostly overlooked to include the assessment of global market trends. Therefore, this paper proposes Acceptability Engineering (AE) framework to enhance the growth and expansion of markets relying on the environments, wherein wheelchairs can coordinate with IoT to enable smart technologies. AE as a standard engineering approach would help in – evaluating the characteristics of IoT-wheelchair environments, analysing their market trends, and highlighting the deficiencies between early and prevailing markets. This will significantly impact the manufacturers, who market wheelchairs specific to the IoT environments, and in addition manufacturers would be able to identify the potential users of their manufactured products.",Bhat S.; Dar M.; Elalfy H.; Matheen M.; Shah S.,Journal,International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,2021-01-01,Kuwait College of Science & Technology;Faculty of Engineering;College of Sciences;National Institute of Electronics and Information Technology (NIELIT),acceptability engineering ;  early adopters ;  human-centered engineering ;  innovative technologies ;  Wheelchairs IoT

Prediction Modelling of Cold Chain Logistics Demand Based on Data Mining Algorithm,"Modern information technologies such as big data and cloud computing are increasingly important and widely applied in engineering and management. In terms of cold chain logistics, data mining also exerts positive effects on it. Specifically, accurate prediction of cold chain logistics demand is conducive to optimizing management processes as well as improving management efficiency, which is the main purpose of this research. In this paper, we analyze the existing problems related to cold chain logistics in the context of Chinese market, especially the aspect of demand prediction. Then, we conduct the mathematical calculation based on the neural network algorithm and grey prediction. Two forecasting models are constructed with the data from 2013 to 2019 by R program 4.0.2, aiming to explore the cold chain logistics demand. According to the results estimated by the two models, we find that both of models show high accuracy. In particular, the prediction of neural network algorithm model is closer to the actual value with smaller errors. Therefore, it is better to consider the neural network algorithm as the first choice when constructing the mathematical forecasting model to predict the demand of cold chain logistic, which provides a more accurate reference for the strategic deployment of logistics management such as optimizing automation and innovation in cold chain processes to adapt to the trend.",He B.; Yin L.,Journal,Mathematical Problems in Engineering,2021-01-01,Hubei University of Automotive Technology,

Non-Coherent and Backscatter Communications: Enabling Ultra-Massive Connectivity in 6G Wireless Networks,"With the commencement of the 5th generation (5G) of wireless networks, researchers around the globe have started paying their attention to the imminent challenges that may emerge in the beyond 5G (B5G) era. Various revolutionary technologies and innovative services are offered in 5G networks, which, along with many principal advantages, are anticipated to bring a boom in the number of connected wireless devices and the types of use-cases that may cause the scarcity of network resources. These challenges partly emerged with the advent of massive machine-type communications (mMTC) services, require extensive research innovations to sustain the evolution towards enhanced-mMTC (e-mMTC) with the scalable network cost in 6th generation (6G) wireless networks. Towards delivering the anticipated massive connectivity requirements with optimal energy and spectral efficiency besides low hardware cost, this paper presents an enabling framework for 6G networks, which utilizes two emerging technologies, namely, non-coherent communications and backscatter communications (BsC). Recognizing the coherence between these technologies for their joint potential of delivering e-mMTC services in the B5G era, a comprehensive review of their state-of-the-art is conducted. The joint scope of non-coherent and BsC with other emerging 6G technologies is also identified, where the reviewed technologies include unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted communications, visible light communications (VLC), quantum-assisted communications, reconfigurable large intelligent surfaces (RLIS), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and machine learning (ML)-aided intelligent networks. Subsequently, the scope of these enabling technologies for different device types (e.g., UAVs, body implants, etc), service types (e.g., e-mMTC), and optimization parameters (e.g., spectrum, energy, cost) is analyzed. Finally, in the context of the proposed non-coherent and BsCs based framework for e-mMTCs, some promising future research directions and open research challenges are highlighted.",Nawaz S.; Sharma S.; Mansoor B.; Patwary M.; Khan N.,Journal,IEEE Access,2021-01-01,COMSATS University Islamabad;University of Luxembourg;Capital University of Science & Technology;University of Wolverhampton,5G ;  6G ;  B5G ;  backscatter ;  IoT ;  mMTC ;  non-coherent
Protecting Intellectual Property Rights of Industrial Software,"The importance of software is increasing and software has become the main driver of innovation in many industrial products.

Advanced joining processes unit: A fully independent research group,"The Advanced Joining Processes (AJP) is an autonomous research unit at the Institute of Science and Innovation in Mechanical and Industrial Engineering (INEGI) that works closely with the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP). This unit is staffed by professors, post-doctoral researchers, PhD students, MSc students and research fellows. The AJP unit has four key competences, established to support all aspects related to the study of advanced joining processes: testing, simulation, production and machine design. The AJP unit has robust and fully independent competences in the manufacture of experimental specimens and components. The unit operates a fully equipped laboratory with all facilities necessary to manufacture specimens, moulds, test fixtures and testing equipment. The unit has extensive experience in testing complex specimens’ geometry under a wide range of conditions. Research is carried out to determine the performance of structural joints under quasi-static loads, high strain rates, fatigue and creep conditions, among many others. Complementarily, the unit also has a strong machine design capability, being experienced in the development and manufacture of custom designed testing equipment (such as creep testing machines, drop-weight testing machines, torsion testing machines, split Hopkinson pressure bars and devices for glass transition temperature measurement). These experimental capabilities are complemented with robust numerical simulation competencies, which allow to streamline the design process by creating powerful models that can accurately predict the mechanical behaviour of advanced structural joints. These capabilities enable the AJP unit to undertake new and challenging research projects, reacting quickly to current industrial demands and scientific trends, due to its autonomy. This work methodology allows the AJP unit to simultaneously operate in two main fronts. One is fundamental academic research, resulting in MSc and PhD thesis and scientific publication, and the other is comprised of knowledge-transfer activities with industrial partners, which generate funding that can be used to support additional fundamental research. By combining these two approaches, the AJP unit proves that sound technological based educational processes can be achieved while undertaking cutting edge research with practical and industrial value.",Carbas R.; Marques E.; da Silva L.,Journal,U.Porto Journal of Engineering,2021-01-01,Instituto de Ciência e Inovação em Engenharia Mecânica e Engenharia Industrial;Universidade do Porto,Machine Design ;  Production ;  Research Group ;  Simulation ;  Testing

Using open innovation platforms for technology transfer,"The use of Internet platforms such as open innovation platforms is a quite new strategy in innovation management that marks a rethinking from classical principles of coordination in innovation processes. Instead of relying exclusively on the internal expertise of their own researchers and developers, companies are increasingly integrating external problem-solvers (often supported by so-called innovation intermediaries) into their innovation processes. As an alternative to conducting traditional research or commissioning engineering service providers or academics with third-party contracts, a large, undefined network of actors are openly invited to participate in the innovative project (known as the “broadcast search” principle). Participants who know an answer to the problem respond by providing solutions—despite never being commissioned to do so by a manager. This procedure offers completely new potential and opportunities for knowledge and technology transfer and gives access to the knowledge held by third parties in new ways.",Piller F.; Hilgers D.; Ihl C.; Schmidthuber L.,Book Series,FGF Studies in Small Business and Entrepreneurship,2021-01-01,Johannes Kepler University Linz;Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen;Hamburg University of Technology;WU Vienna University of Economics and Business,Broadcast search ;  Open innovation ;  Technology transfer

Assessment of Augmented Reality Technology’s Impact on Speed of Learning and Task Performance in Aeronautical Engineering Technology Education,"Objective: This study compared learning and skill transfer among university aviation students using interactive Augmented Reality (AR) technology versus traditional paper-based instruction. While similar AR use and research in university education exists, this study piloted a comparative method assessing knowledge retention and transfer. Background: AR technology is a popular tool used in technical education. But learner behaviors observed like game play and exploration during this study could impact future learning strategy design as AR use increases. Method: 36 university undergraduate students enrolled in a university aeronautical engineering technology program were divided into AR and paper-based groups and compared on first-time task execution times for starting an aircraft auxiliary power unit (APU). A two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test comparing times for task completion was used. Results: Learner task times using AR were consistently faster, replicating similar AR studies, compared to learners using paper-based. However, AR test subjects also took longer interacting with the technology, including gaming-style “play” and exploration of the digital twin AR flight deck environment. This is believed to enhance learner innovation, knowledge retention and transfer, warranting further study. Conclusion: AR users had significantly reduced task execution times. Pre-task “gamification and play” were also observed among the AR users, which could impact how educators and the industry assess and leverage learning strategies when using AR for job task training.",Borgen K.; Ropp T.; Weldon W.,Journal,International Journal of Aerospace Psychology,2021-01-01,Purdue Polytechnic Institute,aerospace education ;  Augmented reality ;  aviation education
Progressive university technology transfer of innovation capabilities to smes: An active and modular educational partnership,"Regarding SMEs’ relationship with R&D and technology, university technology transfer (UTT) programs have evolved in recent years toward approaches that are more focused on a systemic and continuous exchange between firms, university departments, and R&D centers. Financial support such as innovation vouchers and open initiatives has been applied for a few years, and only recently have research works analyzed the impacts of these programs on the innovative capabilities of SMEs. Existing studies are based on short-term analysis, but there are no studies on the medium- or long-term influence of innovation vouchers on firms’ innovation capabilities. This chapter aims to contribute to this topic through a longitudinal exploratory study of two SMEs in eastern France. It puts forward an original modular program proposed by an engineering school at the University of Lorraine, where groups of students participate throughout the academic year in innovation-related projects. Empirical evidence shows that this type of project has positive impacts on firms’ innovative capabilities, but also fosters the analytical skills and self-directed learning capabilities of students.",Camargo M.; Morel L.; Lhoste P.,Book Series,FGF Studies in Small Business and Entrepreneurship,2021-01-01,Université de Lorraine,Innovation capabilities ;  Innovation vouchers ;  Open innovation ;  Problem-based learning ;  SMEs ;  UTT

Active learning effects on students’ performance: A methodological proposal combining cooperative approaches towards improving hard and soft skills,"Empirical evidences on the benefits of cooperative learning at the higher education a still limited. This paper aims at verifying the hypothesis of improvement from the cooperative learning to students’ performance. Firstly, the Fast-300 based learning is introduced as a methodological proposal combining cooperative approaches. From a case study, analysis of variance was carried out comparing scores, before and after the application of Fast-300. Moreover, students’ perception of effect on theoretical understanding, communication, logical reasoning, and leadership, were collected using Likert-type scale. Then, an index was generated to measure the effect based on this perception. The results showed that the students’ performance after the application of Fast-300 had a statistically significant improvement. In addition, the students’ perception indicated enhancement of the skills evaluated. In conclusion, the Fast-300 can be considered a promising alternative for improving both hard and soft-skills. Future studies may evaluate the effects on cognitive permanence, emotional effects, among other skills.",Bressane A.; dos Santos Bardini V.; Spalding M.,Journal,International Journal of Innovation and Learning,2021-01-01,"Universidade Estadual Paulista ""Júlio de Mesquita Filho""",21st-century skills ;  Educational research ;  Engineering education ;  Fast-300 method ;  Higher education ;  Innovative education ;  Student engagement ;  Student skill ;  Studentcentred learning ;  TBL method

An innovative application of event structure analysis (ESA),"This paper presents an innovative application of event structure analysis (ESA). The key improvements incorporated on the method are: (i) a robust system for coding events; (ii) the use of causal process tracing tests for inferring necessary connections; (iii) the combination of ESA with network analyses. Finally, we propose five types of analysis for event network models (i.e., critical elements, critical associations, critical connections, critical specific happenings, and critical antecedents) and exemplify some of them in a causal case study about the process of capability construction for open innovation management in an Industrial Electronic Manufacturer. • ESA can be combined with process-tracing tests to ground counterfactual causal inferences. • ESA can be combined with network analysis to explore quantitative patterns in event structures. • ESA is an outstanding method to conduct process research in management and engineering.",Freitas J.; Melo J.; Salerno M.; Bagno R.; Brasil V.,Journal,MethodsX,2021-01-01,Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais;Universidade de São Paulo,Causal process tracing ;  Critical events ;  Emergence ;  ESA ;  Event structure analysis ;  Event Structure Analysis (ESA)
Standards. The building blocks of complexity,"Without standards, the world as we know it would not be possible. International and supra-cultural standards and norms have been a key factor in engineering, as well as in the development of industrial societies. Despite the obvious successes in electronic and mechanical design, other technological areas present difficulties for the application of standards. In the field of biotechnology and synthetic biology - which aims at studying living things from an engineering perspective - standards are desirable, but whether they can be widely adopted remains to be proved. This monograph reviews the sociological and scientific aspects of standardisation and delves into the more problematic facets of universal standardisation, especially in the biological field. Are standards possible in synthetic biology at all? What are the limitations to the universal use of modular and interchangeable parts in a cellular context? Could it be that the biological world resists standardisation, similarly to the field of software engineering, where these attempts have not progressed? And should some kind of standard be applicable in synthetic biology, what qualities might be required in an environment of open science and responsible research and innovation?.",Peretó J.; Porcar M.,Journal,Metode,2021-01-01,Universitat de València,

Gaganyaan mission: Socio-technical systems design and strategic perspectives of India's human spaceflight program,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India in his Independence Day address on August 15, 2018, committed the nation to achieve a Human Spaceflight by the 75th Anniversary of Indian Independence in 2022. Following this momentous political decision, the Indian Union Cabinet approved a budget of ₹10,000 Crores (~$1.4 Billion) in December 2018. The design and development of Indian Human Spaceflight Program (HSF) is a highly complex, large scale, public sociotechnical system (STS) with strong interwoven technical, political and social players within a dynamic ecosystem that influences national strategic perspectives, technology capability, foreign policy, economic development and sociocultural spheres of the Republic of India. Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) has launched the Gaganyaan Mission (“Sky Craft”) project with the mandated goal of a first crewed spaceflight to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and safe recovery by 2022. Since 2007, ISRO has developed several critical technologies for the Human Spaceflight Program. The Indian HSF program is a national endeavor that aims to bring together expertise in diverse disciplines and realize capacity building, spur technological innovation, and inspire youth in science & technology. As part of Gaganyaan Mission, ISRO plans to conduct two orbital tests during 2020-21 with a Cognitive AI Based robot, VyomMitra (“Space Friend”), a half-humanoid before the crewed mission. STS frameworks and related strategic perspectives allow us to understand the interplay of scientific and technological developments with the other dimensions of the society. The sociotechnical systems (STS) frameworks such as Stakeholder Value Network (SVN), STS Architecture models, systems design through phenomena studies and STS Impact through policy levers can be utilized to evaluate the systems design and explore the complex space engineering endeavor.

Antitumoral microorganisms: The Swiss army knife of immunotherapy,"Research on viruses, bacteria and protozoa-based immunotherapy has been on the rise for several years. The antitumoral efficacy of these microorganisms relies on three main mechanisms: Destruction of tumor cells, stimulation of the immune response and reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment. In order to optimize their immunotherapeutic action, these microorganisms can be genetically engineered to enhance their tumor-targeting efficacy or to vectorize immunostimulating molecules and/or antibodies. To this aim, molecular engineering allows the design of new antibody formats optimizing their functions. From whole antibodies to tandem single-chain variable fragments, various antibody formats can be vectorized by microorganisms to target receptors such as immune checkpoints or recruit immune effector cells within the tumor. Such possibilities broaden the arsenal of immunotherapeutic cancer treatment. This review focuses on these innovations and their advantages for immunotherapy.",Coënon L.; Battistoni A.; Poupée-Beaugé A.; Germon S.; Dimier-Poisson I.,Journal,Medecine/Sciences,2021-01-01,Université de Tours,

"Challenging hydraulic structures of the twenty-first century–from bubbles, transient turbulence to fish passage","Hydraulic structures are man-made waterworks interacting with the rainfall run-off to store and convey water, or mitigate the impact of run-off. Current approaches in hydraulic structure design tend to be conservative, not much differing from ancient designs. Modern structures are often designed based upon simplistic concepts to optimize their performances. However, today’s hydraulic engineers must embrace a number of new challenges, emerging in response to the quickly growing world population, changing climate, evolving agriculture, and growing industrial needs. Herein, new challenges are reviewed using diverse examples of air entrainment at hydraulic structures, transient turbulence during surge events in conveyance structures, and upstream fish passage at road crossings. It is argued that many technical solutions are not satisfactory, e.g. in terms of sustaining aquatic flora and fauna, fluid–structure interactions and operational constraints. Indeed, the current and emerging technical challenges in hydraulic structure design are massive for the twenty-first century hydraulic engineers. The solutions rely upon engineering innovation, excellence in hydraulic research and quality education in universities, complemented by indispensable interactions between engineers, scientists and water stakeholders.",Chanson H.; Leng X.; Wang H.,Journal,Journal of Hydraulic Research,2021-01-01,Université de Bordeaux;The University of Queensland;Sichuan University,Air bubble entrainment ;  hydraulic design ;  hydraulic structures ;  road crossings ;  unsteady transient surges ;  upstream fish passage

Creating entrepreneurial ecosystem in higher education institutes: A case study,"As of late, technological innovation and entrepreneurship have been underlined in engineering education. There is a need to all the more likely comprehend which individual and contextual level factors are identified with engineering students’ innovative goals. The Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Centre (IEDC) at Kalasalingam Academy of Research and Education was established as an initiative of the National Science and Technology Entrepreneurship Development Board (NSTEDB), Department of Science and Technology (DST), New Delhi to create an entrepreneurial culture and foster growth of innovation and entrepreneurship amongst the faculty and students. This centre has designed innovative and systematic strategies to train the students from the beginning and take them through the journey of becoming a confident and successful entrepreneur. Every year this centre is providing financial support to several students to the tune of 15 lakhs per project for developing innovative products supported under the various schemes of the Government of India such as DST start-up, MSME, and so on. Apart from the financial support, mentoring and infrastructural support for these projects are also extended. The centre also arranges various activities and awareness camps related to Entrepreneurship, Technology-based Innovation, and Idea to Product contests for the students throughout as they move from the first year to the fourth year of their study. As an outcome of all these the students have started 10 start-up companies in the last three years and started generating revenue income. Moreover, these companies have created job opportunities for various job seekers. IEDC has also supported Start-up companies by providing the proper office set-up with the necessary infrastructure. Therefore, the students become entrepreneurs and give a job to another Student. Apart from the Financial Grants from the Government of India, the IEDC centre helps in getting loans from banks to establish their companies in a large set-up. And also, this Centre keeps on supporting the Alumni Entrepreneurs through various aspects through guiding them related to Technological-based problem to solution, Marketing, and even Financial assistance. On the whole, IEDC joins hands with students and entrepreneurs for their better living. The proposed framework reacts adequately to the rising difficulties and openings both at national and worldwide dimensions identifying with Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs).

Assessment to enhance and demonstrate graduate attributes,"India has to develop engineers with competencies required for independent practice in which the graduates can work similarly to competent senior engineers and managers. Graduate attributes form a set of individually assessable outcomes that are components indicative of the graduate’s capacity to acquire competence to independently practice at the desired level of the industry. In the knowledgebased global economy, the engineering graduates should possess the needed outstanding abilities to solve complex and real-life programs of the fast-growing global industry. A sizable percentage of Indian Engineering graduates are found to be lacking industry-specific skills, competencies and rendered jobless. A snap study on the alumni shows that fine- tuning of assignments based on industrial practice is essential. The SWOT Analysis suggests that the need for continuous quality development programs for engineering students. All the engineering programs are to be accredited under NBA as per the Washington Accord so that the graduate engineers can register in other countries if they migrate. Otherwise, they have to work for a minimum of two years as an intern. India has to establish an Engineering Council for the registration of the engineering graduates as similar to the Architectural Council. The need for industry-focused complex development programs for all students has been identified based on the qualitative research done. It is found that there is an urgent need for graduates to prepare portfolios and plan to acquire desired competence through seminars, research, industry- specific capstone projects, and selfplanned practicum.

Innovation and development of modern theories for foundation design,"A set of new theory of foundation design is introduced based on in-situ plate loading tests. The calculation of foundation settlement and the reasonable determination of bearing capacity in foundation design are the classic problems in soil mechanics. Although the modern soil mechanics theories have developed soil constitutive models and numerical methods to solve complex problems such as nonlinearities, the actual engineering design around the world is still using the traditional semi-theoretical and semi-empirical method. It is a problem that has not been solved well since the foundation of soil mechanics theory for nearly a hundred years. What is the root cause of the problem? How to solve it? It is believed that for the structured hard soils, the traditional theories are based on the indoor soil sample tests to obtain parameters. Due to the influences of sampling disturbances, the parameters obtained in this way cannot reflect the characteristics of the in-situ soils, so that the calculated results based on such parameters are not consistent with actual conditions and the results vary greatly. In order to solve this problem, the model for calculating the tangent modulus method is established based on the in-situ plate loading test curve, and the three soil parameters of the model are inversely calculated: initial tangent modulus Et0, cohesion c and internal friction angle φ. The proposed method requires few parameters and has clear physical meaning. The parameters are derived from the in-situ tests, avoiding the influences of sampling disturbance, and the accuracy is reliable. It can be used to calculate the whole process from the nonlinearity of foundation settlement to failure. For the bearing capacity of foundation, the relation curve of the pressure and settlement (p-s curve) of the actual foundation is calculated by the tangent modulus method. According to the p-s curve, a method to determine the most suitable bearing capacity of foundation based on the principles of dual-control of strength and deformation realizes the deformation control design. At the same time, this method can solve the problem of the size effect of the bearing capacity directly determined by the plate loading test curve in the past. For the settlement calculation of soft soil foundation, on the basis of the Duncan-Chang model, a practical method for calculating the nonlinear settlement is established using the e-p curve of the compression tests. And a method for calculating e-p curve with compressive modulus Es1-2 is established, so that only the compressive modulus Es1-2 can be used to calculate the nonlinear settlement. Since the compressive modulus Es1-2 of general saturated soft soils is about 2~4 MPa, the range of change is small, the parameters are simple and reliable, and the proposed method is easy to apply. This research provides a new idea for solving the century-old problems of soil mechanics and a more scientific new method for modern foundation design, which is worthy of further development and improvement.",Yang G.,Journal,Yantu Gongcheng Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Geotechnical Engineering,2021-01-01,The Geotechnical Engineering Technology Center of Guangdong Province;Guangdong Research Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower,Bearing capacity ;  Foundation settlement ;  Plate loading test ;  Tangent modulus method
Outcome based project for betterment of rural community,"In the last about one decade, science, technology and innovation have greatly influenced in shaping the modern engineering education. However, there is an urgent need to take the benefits of science and technology influence to offer practical solutions to the betterment of the society. The B.Tech curriculum of KARE (Kalasalingam Academy of Research and Education) is designed to include mandatory one year long course of Community Service Project with an aim to address the difficulties faced by the rural women and farmers of neighbouring community. This study focuses on the strategy adopted and the success witnessed with the introduction of this course. The participants included in the study are 18 engineering undergraduate students. The students surveyed the community with a specifically designed questionnaire to identify the specific problems of the community stakeholders in relation to the social, economic and other aspects. The students through their survey identified the problem of the chosen community as the outcome of Phase I of the project. In Phase II, the students involved in designing and developing the prototype through simple scientific solution. The main challenge is in sustaining the motivation of students to work beyond the duration of the project to bring everything to final shape. This can be done both by developing empathy in the minds of students for their fellow being in the community as well as creating awareness of the many funding schemes available to recognize and support such endeavour. It is recommended that all the institutions should create an avenue in their curriculum to facilitate students’ involvement with the community.",Arunajanani V.; Naresh Kumar Sharma N.; Hariram N.; Vishnuvarthanan G.; Reginold Jebitta S.; Arunprasath T.; Chitradevi K.; Sheik Asraf S.,Journal,Journal of Engineering Education Transformations,2021-01-01,Kalasalingam Academy of Research and Education,Biofertilizer ;  Community service project ;  Field visit ;  Prototype ;  Refrigerator ;  robotic arm ;  Sanitary napkin ;  Survey
Leveraging government initiatives through facilitating the newly recruited faculty members in engineering,"Under the fast-changing disruptive technologies and fierce global competitions, employers are looking for industry-ready graduates with excellent attributes and innovative skills to develop state-of-art products and replace them periodically with superior products to get the lions’ share of global markets. This is possible only if the institutes focus their efforts to develop outstanding faculty members. National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 provides a guideline to develop Indian Education to innovate in all spheres. In the last fifty years, there were many faculty development efforts, but none of them provided long-term impact. A study has been taken on the following issues: 1). Flawless Recruitment Process, 2). Planning and Conducting Orientation Programs, 3). Attaching them with Dedicated Mentors, 4). Planning and Implementing Continuous Professional Development Programs, 5). Conducting Appreciative Inquires and Follow up 6). Encouraging them to Undergo Advanced Research and Development Programs in the Research Universities. 7). Encouraging and Inducting them into the Ongoing Consultancy Projects, 8). Training them to Establish Interdisciplinary Graduate and Postgraduate Research and Programs, 9). Training and Inducting them in Planning and Conducting State, Regional, National, and International Conferences/ Seminars/Symposia, 10). Assessing their Performance and Implementing Recognition Systems for Outstanding Accomplishments, 11). Encouraging them in Planning and Implementing Diverse Global Faculty Development, 12). Facilitating them in planning Institute-Institute Collaboration, and 13.) Mentoring them to reach Higher Academic Cadres. The management should cultivate a culture of supporting and rewarding the best practices which will enable the growth of the graduates and the institute. The research on creating, supporting, and rewarding the promising newly recruited-faculty members has become essential not only to retain them but also, to serve the industries to reach national and global standards with needed human capital and technical support. The current National Educational Policy 2020 of India also focuses on these aspects, but the institutes have yet to refine their recruitment and rewarding best faculty members. This research suggests low-cost but high yielding human resource management practices to sustain the innovations in higher education and to support the knowledge-based Indian economy.",Vedhathiri T.,Journal,Journal of Engineering Education Transformations,2021-01-01,National Institute of Technical Teachers Training and Research,And suggestions ;  Continuous training ;  Global best practices ;  Mentoring ;  Recognition of outstanding performance ;  Recruitment of faculty
Impact of project-based learning on entrepreneurial and social skills development,"The management and entrepreneurship subject in the engineering curriculum is the most imperative at the same time overlooked subject when it comes to experiential learning. Therefore, it was realized that there is a need to bring up some innovations concerning course content delivery strategies and assessment to improve the entrepreneurial and social skills among the students. The purpose of this study is to find the impacts of projectbased learning and identify all factors that influence our students to get succeed. This exposed students to numerous opportunities to learn how to think critically and analyze the ideas on board. The flip classroom is used to describe the concept, and Project-Based Learning served as a tool for the students to develop their Entrepreneurial Skills. These strategies helped the students to continue learning on the topic further. They discovered various job opportunities, career paths they thought of or known existed. This type of instructional method repurposed the class hours for an inquiry which was beneficial for students to learn better. The pedagogical practices which are discussed here were found to be the most effective ones when compared with conventional classroom teaching and in terms of student’s involvement in learning. It is perceived that to unleash our students’ entrepreneurial skills, curricula must include outcomes that enable lifelong learning and encourage inquiry beyond the classroom rather than only defining measurable learning outcomes. The current research motivated the students to submit business plans for startups.",Pinto A.; Reshma K.,Journal,Journal of Engineering Education Transformations,2021-01-01,"St Joseph Engineering College, Mangaluru",Project-based learning ;  Social and entrepreneurial skills
Total sustainable evaluation for road projects,"Quality of Infrastructure became indispensable to the innovation-driven development. Poor infrastructure quality means more extra costs for operation and maintenance, in addition to unstudied impacts on the surrounding environment and society. To eliminate the bad impacts and the extra costs, sustainability must be applied in all infrastructure projects. Sustainability represents one of the latest degree subjects that have various trials to connect the social science with the engineering and the environmental science with the future technology. The objective of this research is to provide an integrated sustainable evaluation system (ISES) for quantifying all impacts of road projects. The proposed evaluation system took into consideration the different phases of project including construction phase and operational phase. The different impacts of road projects were divided into three main classifications; the project economic costs to include costs of project construction and operation; the environmental impacts; and the social impacts. Furthermore, a real case study was discussed to validate the research methodology, where it was concluded that the environmental and social impacts have the main impact on project decision and according to the ISES value, the case study road has a sustainable impact on the surrounding environment and society.",Sayed N.; Abdel-Hamid M.; El-Dash K.,Journal,International Journal of Engineering Research in Africa,2021-01-01,Faculty of Engineering at Shoubra,Infrastructure ;  Roads ;  Sustainability

China's Auto Industry Upgrade Process Based on Aging Chain and Coflow Model,"To protect energy resources and alleviate environmental pollution, many countries attach great importance to the transformation of traditional industries into clean energy industries. In this paper, fuel vehicles (FVs), hybrid vehicles (HVs), and electric vehicles (EVs) are included in the research. Then, based on the aging chain and coflow theory of SDs, we construct a dynamic matching model of the auto industry upgrade process and its energy consumption attributes. The simulation results of China's auto industry show that (1) the upgrading of the auto industry is an evolutionary process from high energy consumption and high pollution to low energy consumption and no pollution and the transition from FVs and HVs to EVs will undergo two adjustments; (2) simply reducing energy supply does not have the expected impact on vehicle size and vehicle energy consumption intensity and only by adjusting the energy supply and upgrade ratios together, energy utilization efficiency can be improved; (3) market screening time has an impact on auto industry upgrade speed by affecting vehicle market share and dwell time; (4) China's auto industry upgrade process should adhere to ""problem-oriented""and strengthen consumer guidance, technology innovation, and infrastructure construction. The conclusions can provide references for industrial policy adjustment and industrial structure optimization.",Zhang B.; Li P.; Zhou H.; Yue X.,Journal,Complexity,2021-01-01,Lubar School of Business;Shanxi University of Finance and EcoNomics;Samuel Ginn College of Engineering,

Intelligent Software Defined Networking,"In the past few years, artificial intelligence (AI) has attracted the attention of both academia and industry with strong momentum and has been widely utilized in various fields. Computer networks provide critical computing infrastructure for the realization of AI. However, it is inefficient to provide AI with computing power in a fast and accurate manner, because of the inherently distributed structure of traditional networks, and it results in the difficulty in practical application and deployment. Software defined networking (SDN) proposes the concept of centralized control, which adapts computing capability for AI on demand and thereby can achieve comprehensive deployment. Combining AI and SDN to realize intelligent software defined networking can not only solve problems of traditional network but also promote network application innovation. Therefore, this paper introduces the problems which exist in the scenario where combining AI and SDN, explains the necessity of SDN based on AI, and analyzes the advantages of combining SDN with AI. Secondly, from the bottom up, the different combination cases of AI and SDN are considered which include data plane, control plane, and application plane. Besides, the challenges and key technologies are introduced from three aspects: routing optimization, network security, and traffic engineering. Furthermore, the advantages and prospects of the intelligent software defined networking are analyzed via combining other emerging fields comparison, and some future research works are outlined.",Li K.; Wang X.; Yi B.; Huang M.; Liu X.,Journal,Ruan Jian Xue Bao/Journal of Software,2021-01-01,"College of Computer Science and Engineering, Northeastern University;College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University",Artificial intelligence ;  Network security ;  Software defined networking ;  Traffic prediction
A benchtop single-sided magnet with NMR well-logging tool specifications – Examples of application,"This article was written in honor of Prof. Bernhard Blümich, who has heavily impacted many areas of Magnetic Resonance and, in particular, low-field and portable NMR with numerous advances, concepts, innovations, and applications of this impressive technology. Many years ago, we decided to research and develop single-sided magnets for the area of petroleum science and engineering to study oil reservoir rocks in the laboratory under well-logging conditions. The global urge to exploit oil reserves requires the analysis of reservoirs, intending to characterize the yields before starting the production. Thus, well-logging tools have been developed to estimate the quality of oil and reservoir productivity. NMR logging is included in these analytical tools, and numerous operations using this kind of device were performed since the early 1950s. To contribute to this vital research area, we show the development of a new benchtop single-sided NMR system, with well-logging tool characteristics, a cylindrical sweet spot with 4 cm of diameter and length, with magnetic field of 47 mT centered at 11 cm from the magnet's surface and a constant gradient of 35.7 G/cm along z. This system was used in self-diffusion, T1-T2, and D-T2 measurements of standard liquids and rock cores, demonstrating its functionality.",de Oliveira-Silva R.; Lucas-Oliveira É.; de Araújo-Ferreira A.; Trevizan W.; Vidoto E.; Sakellariou D.; Bonagamba T.,Journal,Journal of Magnetic Resonance,2021-01-01,KU Leuven;Universidade de São Paulo;Petrobras,Deep sweet spot ;  NMR porous media ;  NMR well-logging ;  Single-sided magnet
Error characteristic analysis of fluid momentum law test apparatus,"The flat-plate momentum test bench is a widely used experimental device in the verification of the momentum law of fluid mechanics, and its error characteristics are of positive significance for theoretical research and engineering innovation and expansion. The SPH-FEM coupling algorithm and spectrum analysis method are used to calculate and analyze the displacement response and spectrum characteristics of the characteristic points of the sensor under different jet loads. Based on them, the cause, classification, law, scope, influence and control method of the measurement error of the system are discussed and analyzed with the application of the error theory and the lateral effect theory of strain gauges; combined with physical experiments, the relevant analysis methods and conclusions are verified. The results show that the measurement error of the system includes linear error and periodic error. Structural deformation in the direction of jet impact is the main source of linear error; linear error increases with the increase of jet loads. Meanwhile, periodic vibration in non-jet direction is the main cause of periodic error, and the periodic error decreases with the increase of jet loads.",Yang S.; Zhu X.; Wang H.,Journal,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),2021-01-01,Jilin University,Error analysis ;  Fluid mechanics ;  Momentum law ;  Spectral analysis ;  SPH-FEM coupling algorithm
Current scenario of and future perspective for scientific research in Nepal,"Scientific research can act as the 'bedrock for development' which can provide a solid foundation for the overall socioeconomic transformation in a country through invention and innovation. The inclusion of seven groups of Nepalese monuments in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)'s world heritage sites provides evidence of the richness in architecture and civil engineering in the country, which also show how Nepal was influenced by arts and religious philosophy. The government of Nepal (GoN) has established different scientific departments, universities, and research institutions, and has tried to emphasize the application of science and research for the development of the nation. These institutions, however, have inadequate resources, exist in a poor academic and research environment and are subject to overt political influence.

Lifestyle changes in mitigation pathways: Policy and scientific insights,"Lifestyle changes are key factors of the climate mitigation challenge because they drive the demand for energy, goods and food. They have received growing attention in the development and assessment of mitigation pathways, one of the key approaches used to inform mitigation policies. This paper contributes to this emerging literature by examining the political and scientific implications of integrating lifestyle changes into mitigation pathways. We analyse a large sample of pathways, supplemented by interviews with practitioners, to provide a perspective relevant to both scenario production practices themselves and the science-policy process in which they are included. We use three illustrative pathways to describe what it means to explore lifestyle changes and how this exploration can be conducted (indicators, dimensions, precision). We summarize the observed benefits of the explorations of lifestyle changes in scenario production by considering three main contributions of scenarios to policy decision-making: explicit knowledge, mediation tools and framing power. We also discuss why the integration of lifestyle changes poses a potential challenge to the robustness and reliability of pathway production methodologies, which is a condition for their policy-relevance. We therefore argue that the implications of this integration need to be carefully characterized in order to maximize the policy relevance of the analysis without compromising the robustness of the scenario development and assessment process. The nature of lifestyles, which reflect values and preferences and require a multidisciplinary approach, raises significant policy neutrality challenges and scientific challenges. Overcoming these challenges can lead to more policy-relevant pathways: we describe existing approaches in the literature and analyse their contributions and limitations.",Saujot M.; Le Gallic T.; Waisman H.,Journal,Environmental Research Letters,2021-01-01,Centre International de Recherche sur l'Environnement et le Développement;SciencesPo Paris,climate mitigation ;  decarbonisation pathways ;  IAM ;  lifestyles ;  modelling ;  science-policy interface

Integrated nanolasers via complex engineering of radiationless states,"The development of compact and energy-efficient miniaturised lasers is a critical challenge in integrated non-linear photonics. Current research focuses on the integration of subwavelength all-dielectric lasers in CMOS compatible platforms. These systems provide a viable alternative to state-of-the-art nanoplasmonic sources, whose practicality is often hindered by high metal losses. The efficiency of dielectric nanolasers, however, is affected by the diffraction limit of light, which restricts the degree of localisation achievable with standard resonator modes. The recent development of new types of radiationless states has brought a sharp innovation in the field of subwavelength dielectric lasers. Radiationless states are exotic electromagnetic solutions that originate from the complex superposition and interaction of several resonator modes. They are associated with a high degree of near-field localisation which makes them particularly advantageous for non-linear photonics applications. In this work, we provide an overview of the most recent theoretical and experimental efforts toward the development of integrated lasers and ultrafast sources based on the amplification of exotic radiationless states. In particular, we focus our attention on two specific types of radiationless states: optical anapoles and Bound States in the Continuum (BIC). By discussing their differences and similarities, we provide a unifying view of these distinct research areas and outline possible future directions for these innovative platforms.",Totero Gongora J.; Fratalocchi A.,Journal,JPhys Photonics,2021-01-01,King Abdullah University of Science and Technology;University of Sussex,Anapole ;  Bound states in the continuum ;  Dielectric metamaterials ;  Integrated laser ;  Nanolaser ;  Non-linear nanophotonics
Interoperability Between BIM Objects and ProNIC: Application to Different Building Design Specifications,"Over the last few decades, the architecture, engineering, construction and operation (AECO) sector did not follow the technological evolution observed in other sectors.

Cognitive factors of the transfer of empirical engineering knowledge: A behavioral and fNIRS study,"Knowledge transfer is a progressive method to accelerate knowledge accumulation and technological innovation of enterprises. This hot research topic remains explorative on improving knowledge transfer efficiency in employees' training and engineering practice. However, due to ambiguous cognitive structure, how concepts and knowledge are stored and utilized in employees' minds during problem-solving was poorly answered. Therefore, this paper proposed a concept-sorting test, inspired by the modified Wisconsin Card-Sorting Test (M-WCST), to investigate the near/far transfer mechanism of empirical engineering knowledge (EEK) under the technological paradigm shift. Concept classification experiments were carried out for 31 participants by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to explore the neuroscience basis of EEK transfer. Transfer performance and cognitive load measured in concept-sorting tests showed: (1) The cognitive level of the prior technological paradigm positively increases the transfer performance. However, it causes more perseverative errors due to set patterns of thinking. (2) The transfer distance negatively decreases the performance. Hence the display materials which are different from the prior cognitive structure are not beneficial for participants to learn. (3) The transfer distance significantly impacts the cognitive load. The activation level of brain areas becomes higher when people finish the near EEK transfer and apply it to solve new problems. As an explorative study, the evidence from fNIRS can provide insights into the theory and practice of empirical knowledge management.",Wang F.; Jiang Z.; Li X.; Li G.,Journal,Advanced Engineering Informatics,2021-01-01,Delta-NTU Corporate Laboratory for Cyber-Physical Systems;School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering;Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Cognitive load ;  Empirical engineering knowledge ;  Functional near-infrared spectroscopy ;  Knowledge transfer ;  Technological paradigm shift

Annual banned-substance review: Analytical approaches in human sports drug testing 2019/2020,"Analytical chemistry-based research in sports drug testing has been a dynamic endeavor for several decades, with technology-driven innovations continuously contributing to significant improvements in various regards including analytical sensitivity, comprehensiveness of target analytes, differentiation of natural/endogenous substances from structurally identical but synthetically derived compounds, assessment of alternative matrices for doping control purposes, and so forth. The resulting breadth of tools being investigated and developed by anti-doping researchers has allowed to substantially improve anti-doping programs and data interpretation in general. Additionally, these outcomes have been an extremely valuable pledge for routine doping controls during the unprecedented global health crisis that severely affected established sports drug testing strategies. In this edition of the annual banned-substance review, literature on recent developments in anti-doping published between October 2019 and September 2020 is summarized and discussed, particularly focusing on human doping controls and potential applications of new testing strategies to substances and methods of doping specified the World Anti-Doping Agency's 2020 Prohibited List.",Thevis M.; Kuuranne T.; Geyer H.,Journal,Drug Testing and Analysis,2021-01-01,Universitaires de Médecine Légale;Deutsche Sporthochschule Köln;European Monitoring Center for Emerging Doping Agents,alternative matrices ;  doping ;  mass spectrometry ;  sport
The Business Transformation Framework and Enterprise Architecture Framework for Managers in Business Innovation: An Applied Holistic Mathematical Model,"This journal article proposes a cross-business domain applied holistic mathematical model (AHMM) that is the result of a lifetime long research on business transformations, applied mathematics, software modelling, business engineering, financial analysis, and global enterprise architecture. This ultimate research is based on an authentic and proprietary mixed research method that is supported by an underlining mainly qualitative holistic reasoning model module. The proposed AHMM formalism attempts to mimic some functions of the human brain, which uses empirical processes that are mainly based on the beam-search, like heuristic decision-making process. The AHMM can be used to implement a decision-making system or an expert system that can integrate in the enterprise’s business, information and communication technology environments. The AHMM uses a behaviour driven development environment or a natural language environment that can be easily adopted by the project’s development teams. The AHMM offers a high level implementation environment that can be used by any team member without any prior computer sciences qualification. The AHMM can be used also to model enterprise architecture (EA) blueprints, business transformation projects, or knowledge management systems; it is supported by many real-life cases of various business domains. The uniqueness of this research is that the AHMM promotes a holistic unbundling process, the alignment of various EA standards and transformation strategies to support business transformation projects.",Trad A.,Journal,"International Journal of Service Science, Management, Engineering, and Technology",2021-01-01,IBISTM,Business Applied Mathematics ;  Business Transformation Manager ;  Business Transformation Project ;  Decision-Making Systems ;  Engineering ;  Enterprise Architecture ;  Holisms ;  Knowledge Management Systems ;  Neural Networks ;  Risk Management

University Stormwater Management within Urban Environmental Regulatory Regimes: Barriers to Progressivity or Opportunities to Innovate?,"U.S. public university campuses are held directly responsible for compliance with many of the same federal- and state-level environmental regulations as cities, including stormwater management. While operating as ‘cities within cities’ in many respects, campuses face unique constraints in achieving stormwater regulatory compliance. To compare the abilities of campuses to comply with stormwater regulations to municipalities, we conduct mixed-methods research using primary data from five University of California (UC) campuses. Public universities constituted over 20% of California’s “nontraditional” permittees under the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) regulation regime in 2013. We utilize semi-structured interviews with campus and regulatory officials, a survey of campus students and staff around support and willingness to pay for innovative stormwater management, and content analysis of campus stormwater management documents to examine challenges to public university stormwater compliance. We find that, despite their progressive environmental practices in other areas like energy and water conservation, even as compared to cities, stormwater management practices on the evaluated campuses are constrained by several factors: infrastructure financing limitations, lack of transparent and coordinated decision-making, a lack of campus resident involvement, and regulatory inflexibility. Our study provides new insights, both for understanding campuses as sustainable ‘cities within cities’ and more broadly for urban environmental compliance regimes globally.",Pierce G.; Gmoser-Daskalakis K.; Jessup K.; Grant S.; Mehring A.; Winfrey B.; Rippy M.; Feldman D.; Holden P.; Ambrose R.; Levin L.,Journal,Environmental Management,2021-01-01,"Center for Marine Biodiversity and Conservation;UCLA Fielding School of Public Health;University of California, Santa Barbara;University of California, Los Angeles;Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University;University of Louisville;Monash University;Nature Conservancy;University of California, Irvine",Environmental governance ;  Regulatory compliance ;  Stormwater management ;  University campuses
Gaps and Barriers to Successful Integration and Adoption of Practical Materials Informatics Tools and Workflows,"Preparation of the future materials workforce consistent with major imperatives rooted in integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) and the materials genome initiative (MGI) is most effectively pursued within the vision of a materials innovation ecosystem that spans across conventional engineering, science, and computing disciplines. The ICME foundation integrates principles of materials science with computational methods, including increasing reliance on modern data science methods that are savvy to digital information that recognizes hierarchical material structure and the need for correlative relations for process-structure and structure-property relations. We consider gaps in academic research and education programs related to systems engineering, uncertainty quantification of both experiments and computation, and data science methods.

Mapping the first decade of circular economy research: a bibliometric network analysis,"Most of the previously published bibliometric studies on circular economy (CE) have only focused on one specific region or on a specific CE-related application. This study addresses this gap by conducting a comprehensive bibliometric and network analysis of CE scientific knowledge production on Web of Science (WoS). The research examines the dynamic growth of the CE research during three main stages between 2009 and 2018. Based on a total of 214 peer-reviewed academic articles written by 651 authors, the study provides a bibliometric analysis of the citations, co-citations, collaborations, and keywords co-occurrence networks. The study also reveals most influential authors and articles in the field. Findings show that CE research has been increasing exponentially with an uneven average growth rate of 47.1% per year. Findings also indicate that sustainability, innovation, and waste management represent the current CE “hotspots”.

Sustainable Engineering Approaches Used in Electrical Discharge Machining Processes: A Review,"Sustainable engineering is the approach in which the process is designed in such a way that there is a balance between the use of energy and resources so that it will not affect the environment and can be conserved for fulfilling the needs of future generations. Sustainable engineering in manufacturing focuses on the enhancement of productivity by controlling process parameters. So, it has become a hot topic in almost every field of manufacturing, aiming to achieve more economical and efficient processes. The key methods of sustainable production mainly include the optimization of energy usage and the innovation of machining techniques, etc. Nowadays, many relevant investigations have been conducted. In this paper, the main study is focused on the sustainable engineering approaches used in the electrical discharge machining processes, various optimization techniques used for better productivity in EDM processes. Effect of different process parameters like pulse-on, pulse-off, peak current, spark gap voltage, tool feed, flushing pressure, electrode polarity, dielectric fluid, etc., in machining operations has been discussed. For better machining time and less energy consumption, the optimization of process parameters, the problem of wire rupture in case of wire electrical discharge machining (WEDM), and the use of different electrode materials in EDM machining operations have been reviewed in this study. Efforts have been made to enhance EDM operations by sustainable engineering approaches with a systematic review of different research articles, industrial catalogs, technical fundamentals, etc. Various conclusions are drawn based on a thorough review of research articles and a list of gaps or future scopes have been provided in this paper.",Singh R.; Pratap Singh R.; Trehan R.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering,2021-01-01,Dr. B.R.

Organisational institutionalisation of responsible innovation,"We describe the institutionalisation of responsible innovation (RI) over the last decade at the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and universities funded by it as a focal point for RI in the UK. Drawing on organisational theory we identify factors influencing the dynamics of RI institutionalisation, including forces of legitimation, entrepreneurship and decoupling. We report significant institutionalisation at the EPSRC prior to 2013, when it published its RI policy. Notwithstanding instances of experimentation and assimilation since, we report limited institutionalisation within research communities in universities as RI has encountered competing institutional logics, responsibility norms and epistemic practices. Our findings suggest an ongoing and dynamic process of translation that reflects RI's status as a performative and contested discourse ‘in the making’.",Owen R.; Pansera M.; Macnaghten P.; Randles S.,Journal,Research Policy,2021-01-01,Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona;Manchester Metropolitan University;University of Bristol;Wageningen University & Research,Organisational institutionalism ;  Policy ;  Practice ;  Responsible Innovation
Key aspects for designing business models for a circular bioeconomy,"The circular bioeconomy represents an opportunity of nearly USD $8 trillion until 2030. However, innovative business models are needed for a circular bioeconomy to succeed. What mostly lacks in the body of research on business models for the circular bioeconomy, and what marks the originality of the present article, is summarizing the key aspects that need to be considered when designing, implementing and managing businesses in a circular bioeconomy. Therefore, this study's aim is twofold (i) to reveal key aspects for implementing and managing business models for a circular bioeconomy; and (ii) to point out the issues that lack further research on the theme, based on the existing literature. A systematic literature review was conducted on the Science Direct, Scopus and Web of Science databases. Key aspects for implementing and managing business models were identified according to the business model Canvas framework. Key aspects are related to the role of innovation and new markets, taking the customer perspective into account in the value creation process and being close to customers, adequate management of logistics and feedstock collection systems, being aware of different routes for valuing biomass, seeking technological development, building resilient value chains, and focusing on value creation to cover costs. Issues that need addressing in the existing literature include product-service-systems, take back-systems, seasonal availability of resources, social impacts, rebound effects, and aquatic activities.",Salvador R.; Puglieri F.; Halog A.; Andrade F.; Piekarski C.; De Francisco A.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2021-01-01,The University of Queensland;Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná,added value ;  Bioresource ;  Circular business model ;  Circular economy ;  Valorisation
"Financing innovative projects: Challenges, risks, and opportunities","The implementation of innovative projects determines the main component of effective economic development in contemporary conditions. The relevance of the study is due to the emergence of breakthrough technologies, the acceleration of business processes, the increasing requirements of the competitive environment, and the ongoing search for new growth paradigms. The purpose of the study is to analyze certain trends of innovative economic development and those risks being caused because of financing of innovative projects. Relying on the dominant sources of innovation, the authors identified the categories of innovative sectors of the economy: (1) those being focused on improving efficiency, (2) determined by engineering, (3) customer-oriented, and (4) determined by scientific research. The research shows that the most promising sectors for the development of innovations in Russia are the aerospace sector, the field of nanotechnology, nuclear and hydrogen energy, biomedical life support technologies, and rational nature management. The paper provides a review of possible financing sources for innovative projects. The analysis shows that for managers of innovative projects, there is a choice among various sources—from traditional and time-tested to modern and developing. The authors argue that there are both the high probability of financial losses in innovative entrepreneurship and the need to identify the main risk groups in financing mechanisms for innovative projects. Among them are the risks of design and viability of the project, risks of competence and reliability of project developers, regulatory risks, and risks of cryptocurrency volatility. The authors propose a set of measures aimed at minimizing each risk group and preventing the reduction of financial results when implementing an innovative project.",Myagkova M.; Shilkina T.; Makarov V.; Hairov R.,Book Series,"Studies in Systems, Decision and Control",2021-01-01,Russian University of Cooperation;Sberbank of Russia,Innovation project ;  Innovative activity ;  Innovative development ;  Risks ;  Sources of financing

How human factors affect operators' task evolution in Logistics 4.0,"The spread of the Industry 4.0 paradigm introduced an increasing number of technological innovations into companies to improve logistics processes. During a transition to Logistics 4.0, it is necessary to consider all the issues that affect logistics, among which human factors (HF) are considered to be the most important. On the basis of the existing scientific literature, this article aimed to identify the relationships between 4.0 technologies implementation and HF concerning the evolution of human activities towards different hypothetical future scenarios (i.e., no changes, work replaced, or work assisted), analysing in detail the HF affected by 4.0 technologies. These relationships, which were summarised in a matrix, were also tested through a single longitudinal case study. The research showed that technology tends to replace logistics operators, not only for dangerous physical tasks but also for cognitive tasks that are stressful and repetitive. Moreover, for some tasks in which many different HF are involved, the evolution is towards operator assistance, rather than replacement.",Cimini C.; Lagorio A.; Pirola F.; Pinto R.,Journal,Human Factors and Ergonomics In Manufacturing,2021-01-01,Università degli Studi di Bergamo,case study ;  human factors ;  Logistics 4.0 ;  logistics operator ;  task evolution
Enhancing the effectiveness of multi-agent cooperation for green manufacturing: Dynamic co-evolution mechanism of a green technology innovation system based on the innovation value chain,"A virtuous cycle of the green technology innovation (GTI) system (GTIS) can not only effectively serve GTI subjects in the system but also fully improve green manufacturing and reduce environmental pollution. The essence of the GTIS evolution of manufacturing enterprises (MEs) under multi-agent cooperation (MEUMAC) is encouraged by governments and led by MEs, which jointly promote the process of GTIS from low-end to high-end through interaction with universities, research institutions, supply chains, intermediaries and consumers. MEs cooperate with multiple GTI subjects to continuously improve the GTI level of MEUMAC, and the subsystems of the GTIS interact and coordinate dynamically. To promote the upgrade of the GTIS under multi-agent cooperation, the dynamic co-evolution mechanism of the GTIS needs to be explored. Innovation process is a value chain that transforms from knowledge creation to product promotion based on the innovation value chain. Based on system theory, this process can be solved through five parts: input, processing, output, feedback and upgrade. The structure and evolution path of the GTIS were analysed based on the innovation value chain theory and system theory. Logistic symbiotic response system is a typical system with self-organization characteristics, and the development law of the GTIS of MEUMAC is similar with the symbiotic system. Hence, an evolution model based on a Logistic model was constructed to determine state and control variables. The results show that the evolution of the GTIS of MEUMAC is the spatial advancement and temporal evolution of the system under the action of internal and external subjects, which is ultimately manifested as the process of the GTI performance output. The operation status of green technology is a key factor in the dynamic co-evolution of the GTIS of MEUMAC, which is the order parameter of the system. Environmental regulation policies (ERPs) have a strong positive incentive effect on the dynamic co-evolution of the GTIS of MEUMAC. Regarding the current ERPs, the effect intensity of different policies is command regulation, market regulation, public participation regulation and voluntary action regulation. The results of this study not only help MEs to optimize the implementation process of the GTIS and provide practical guidance to formulate ERPs but also extend the theoretical system of co-evolution and enrich the innovation value chain theory.",Yin S.; Zhang N.; Li B.; Dong H.,Journal,Environmental Impact Assessment Review,2021-01-01,Hebei Agricultural University;Harbin Engineering University;China Aerospace Academy of Systems Science and Engineering,Dynamic co-evolution ;  Green manufacturing ;  Green technology innovation system ;  Innovation value chain ;  Multi-agent cooperation
Non-viral strategies for delivering genome editing enzymes,"Genome-editing tools such as Cre recombinase (Cre), zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and most recently the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated protein system have revolutionized biomedical research, agriculture, microbial engineering, and therapeutic development. Direct delivery of genome editing enzymes, as opposed to their corresponding DNA and mRNA precursors, is advantageous since they do not require transcription and/or translation. In addition, prolonged overexpression is a problem when delivering viral vector or plasmid DNA which is bypassed when delivering whole proteins. This lowers the risk of insertional mutagenesis and makes for relatively easier manufacturing. However, a major limitation of utilizing genome editing proteins in vivo is their low delivery efficiency, and currently the most successful strategy involves using potentially immunogenic viral vectors. This lack of safe and effective non-viral delivery systems is still a big hurdle for the clinical translation of such enzymes. This review discusses the challenges of non-viral delivery strategies of widely used genome editing enzymes, including Cre recombinase, ZFNs and TALENs, CRISPR/Cas9, and Cas12a (Cpf1) in their protein format and highlights recent innovations of non-viral delivery strategies which have the potential to overcome current delivery limitations and advance the clinical translation of genome editing.",Li J.; Røise J.; He M.; Das R.; Murthy N.,Journal,Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews,2021-01-01,Innovative Genomics Institute;Department of Bioengineering;Berkeley College of Chemistry,CRISPR/Cas9 ;  Genome editing ;  Nanoparticles ;  Non-viral ;  Protein delivery
An engineering perspective of vacuum assisted delivery devices in obstetrics: A review,"Complications during childbirth result in the need for clinicians to use ‘assisted delivery’ in over 12% of cases (UK). After more than 50 years in clinical practice, vacuum assisted delivery (VAD) devices remain a mainstay in physically assisting child delivery; sometimes preferred over forceps due to their ease of use and reduced maternal morbidity. Despite their popularity and enduring track-record, VAD devices have shown little evidence of innovation or design change since their inception. In addition, evidence on the safety and functionality of VAD devices remains limited but does present opportunities for improvements to reduce adverse clinical outcomes. Consequently in this review we examine the literature and patent landscape surrounding VAD biomechanics, design evolution and performance from an engineering perspective, aiming to collate the limited but valuable information from a disparate field and provide a series of recommendations to inform future research into improved, safer, VAD systems.",Goordyal D.; Anderson J.; Alazmani A.; Culmer P.,Journal,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part H: Journal of Engineering in Medicine",2021-01-01,Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust;University of Leeds,birth ;  maternal trauma ;  neonatal trauma ;  obstetrics ;  operative vaginal delivery ;  Vacuum assistive delivery ;  vacuum extraction ;  ventouse
Enabling MedTech Translation in Academia: Redefining Value Proposition with Updated Regulations,"Academic institutions are becoming more focused on translating new technologies for clinical applications. A transition from “bench to bedside” is often described to take basic research concepts and methods to develop a therapeutic or diagnostic solution with proven evidence of efficacy at the clinical level while also fulfilling regulatory requirements. The regulatory environment is evolving in Europe with transition and grace periods for the full enforcement of the Medical Device Regulation 2017/745 (MDR), replacing the Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC (MDD). These new guidelines increase demands for scientific, technical, and clinical data with reduced capacity in regulatory bodies creating uncertainty in future product certification. Academic translational activities will be uniquely affected by this new legislation. The barriers and threats to successful translation in academia can be overcome by strong clinical partnerships, close-industrial collaborations, and entrepreneurial programs, enabling continued product development to overcome regulatory hurdles, reassuring their foothold of medical device development.",Letourneur D.; Joyce K.; Chauvierre C.; Bayon Y.; Pandit A.,Journal,Advanced Healthcare Materials,2021-01-01,Université Paris Cité;University of Galway;Medtronic,innovation ;  medical device regulation ;  MedTech ;  tissue engineering ;  translation
Trends in adverse events and related health-care facility utilization from cough and cold medication exposures in children,"Introduction: Initial research following regulatory changes addressing the pediatric safety of cough and cold medications (CCMs) demonstrated decreases in adverse events (AEs). Using a national multi-source surveillance system, we studied subsequent CCM-related AE case rate trends and associated health-care facility (HCF) evaluation in children. Methods: Data were collected from 2009 to 2016. Case eligibility included: age <12 years; exposure to an over-the-counter product containing ≥1 CCM pharmaceutical ingredient; ≥1 significant AE that occurred in the United States. Results: About 4756 (72.6%) cases were determined at least potentially related to an index ingredient. Accidental unsupervised ingestions (AUIs; 3134; 65.9%) were the most common case type. Nearly half of AE cases involved children 2 to <4 years old (2,159; 45.4%). The AE case rate did not change significantly over time (p = 0.22). The proportion of AE cases resulting in HCF admission increased from 32.4% (207) in 2009 to 43.4% (238) in 2016 (p < 0.01). Exposures to diphenhydramine (1,305; 67.3%) and/or dextromethorphan (591; 30.5%) were involved in the majority of HCF admissions. Conclusions: The proportion of AE cases resulting in HCF admission increased from 2009 to 2016. Efforts to prevent AUIs such as packaging innovation and engineering controls, particularly for diphenhydramine and dextromethorphan-containing products, should be pursued.",Wang G.; Green J.; Reynolds K.; Banner W.; Bond G.; Kauffman R.; Palmer R.; Paul I.; Rapp-Olsson M.; Dart R.,Journal,Clinical Toxicology,2021-01-01,Denver Health;Penn State College of Medicine;UMKC School of Medicine;University of Oklahoma College of Pharmacy;an IBH Company;Hope Africa University;Children’s Hospital Colorado,cough/cold medication safety ;  medication safety ;  Pediatric safety surveillance ;  sales-adjusted rates ;  trends
Can the current environmental tax rate promote green technology innovation? - Evidence from China's resource-based industries,"The exploitation and utilization of mineral resources can induce externality problems. An environmental tax rate directly affects pollution reduction results and the green production of resources industries. Considering the higher pollution emission of resource-based industries, China's environmental tax rate is too low to fully compensate for externality and it impedes technological innovation. This paper firstly calculates the optimal tax rate of China's resource-based industries, based on the statistical relationship between environmental tax rates and pollution emissions. Then, the efficiency of green technology innovation is evaluated. The results show that environmental externalities have a depressing effect on green technology innovation. Furthermore, this paper constructs a threshold effect model of the impact of the optimal environmental tax rate on green technology efficiency. It turns out that the air pollution tax rate has a non-linear effect on green technology innovation, and the implementation standard of tax is lower than the optimal tax rate. In addition, the water pollution tax has no optimal level and has an uncertain impact on green innovation. Therefore, China should gradually increase the environmental tax rate, in order to achieve pollution reduction and technological innovation.",Wang Y.; Yu L.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2021-01-01,ECUST School of Business,Environmental tax ;  Externality internalization ;  Technological innovation ;  Threshold effect
Internet of things for water quality monitoring and assessment: A comprehensive review,"The implementation of urbanisation and industrialisation plans lead to the proliferation of contaminants in water resources which is a severe public challenge.

Interdisciplinary effects of technical debt in companies with mechatronic products — a qualitative study,"Digitalization of products and production systems requires a fusion of mechatronic disciplines, where interfaces between mechanical, electrical, and software engineering are inevitable. The increasingly rapid pace of innovations in mechatronic systems triggers decisions being taken under time and cost pressure. At times, compromises in technical solutions are made, neglecting their long-term damage to the system. Technical debt (TD), a concept from software engineering, refers to short-term benefits that lead to long-term negative consequences, e.g., in the form of more difficult maintainability or evolvability. This also applies to mechatronic systems, yet the knowledge of TD characteristics and correlations in the interdisciplinary life cycle has only received little attention. This first comprehensive survey investigates TD in mechatronics systematically and across sectors. 50 experts, of whom 42% hold positions as department heads, from 21 renowned companies and 10 sectors in the German-speaking region supported this study with real scenarios where TD caused damage to their system. 94 informative TD incidents that were classified into twelve TD types were recorded, of which 2/3 have not yet been eliminated and posed a potential risk to the system. TD emerges most frequently in the first three stages of the life cycle, where the consequences rarely remain isolated at their source but are forwarded to later phases and disciplines in the life cycle. In contrast to the research focus in software engineering, the multi-domain analysis of mechatronic TD issues reveals that software engineers are most burdened by Requirements TD and Infrastructure TD in the interdisciplinary environment.",Vogel-Heuser B.; Bi F.,Journal,Journal of Systems and Software,2021-01-01,Technische Universität München,Life cycle ;  Mechatronic product ;  Mechatronics ;  TDinMechatronics ;  Technical debt

Is institutional pressure the mother of green innovation? Examining the moderating effect of absorptive capacity,"The excessive consumption of natural resources in industrial development has led scholars to pay increasing attention to firms’ impact on the environment. Faced with considerable environmental pressure, many firms have begun to integrate green innovation into their business strategies. Based on the institutional theory and absorptive capacity perspective, this study examines the role of different institutional pillars on firms’ green innovation decision and further evaluates the interaction effect of absorptive capacity with institutional pillars. Using datasets from listed Chinese companies, this study examines the above hypotheses. As a result, we identify the heterogeneous effect of institutional pressures on green technology innovation and green management innovation and find a significant effect of absorptive capacity on the relationship between institutional pressures and green technology innovation.

Carbon footprint and eco-efficiency of China's regional construction industry: A life cycle perspective,"The construction industry plays an important role in China's industrialization and urbanization process, which has become a major contributor to carbon emission in China. We innovatively use carbon footprint as an indicator of undesirable output in evaluating the construction industry since it captures both direct and indirect carbon emission. Then we conduct a comprehensive analysis of eco-efficiency of this industry under the framework of natural disposability and managerial disposability with a new radial DEA model on considering both desirable and undesirable outputs. We have several important findings. First, non-metallic mineral products, metal smelting and calendering, electricity and heat production, and supply are major drives from the perspective of the industrial chain. And the carbon footprint is mainly caused by capital formation from the final demand perspective. Second, most regions have a relatively lower eco-efficiency due to weak awareness of environmental protection, and there is a large emission reduction potential by eco-technology innovation. Finally, developed regions prefer to adopt the strategy of increasing investment in eco-technology innovation. The other regions generally adopted the strategy of reducing all inputs. The government should strengthen environment regulation and encourage the developing regions to increase investment in eco-technology innovation.",Zhou Z.; Li K.; Liu Q.; Tao Z.; Lin L.,Journal,Journal of the Operational Research Society,2021-01-01,"Hunan University;Hunan Agricultural University;University of California, Davis",carbon footprint ;  Construction industry ;  data envelopment analysis ;  eco-efficiency ;  life cycle
Digital Laboratories for Educating the IoT-Generation Heatmap for Digital Lab Competences,"The Sharing Economy is the basis for challenging existing business models and the creation of new cooperation’s. The BMBF-funded project Open Digital Lab 4 You (DigiLab4U) promotes the sharing of laboratory (lab) infrastructures for Internet of Things (IoT)/Industry 4.0 (I4.0) related education. Through the digitalisation in education and research, new forms of cross-location networking of lab infrastructures arise. The paper illustrates innovation options for IoT/I4.0 lab infrastructure, exemplary based on a RFID measuring chamber using (I) a Virtual Reality (VR) Mockup, (II) a Service Robot Arm and (III) VR with live data as combination of (I) + (II), to realise cross-location networking.

"Facilitating, envisioning and implementing sustainable development with creative approaches","The diversity and comprehensiveness of sustainable development (SD) require new perspectives, which go beyond existing mindsets and practice. Hence, there is a high demand for creative approaches in SD. Although the connection between creativity and SD has already been addressed in research and practice, there is still a need to study how creative approaches can facilitate SD across disciplines, organizations, communities and societies. This special issue therefore aims to create a discursive space among academics, professionals and doctoral students in areas such as engineering, arts, sociology, education and management to discuss the relations of diverse dimensions of SD and creativity. The special issue is linked to the ARTEM OCC (ARts TEchnology & Management, Organizational Creativity and Sustainability) conference series. It comprises 14 articles, representing theoretical and empirical (surveys and case studies) research on SD and creativity. The studies address methodological issues, education, business processes and supply chains as well as entrepreneurship. A broad variety of the 17 SD goals of the UN Agenda 2030 are addressed through creative approaches. Although the contributions refer to diverse understandings of creativity, representing process, methodological or resource based views, they demonstrate in their variety, that creativity is a collective issue, which is an immanent attitude of interacting people. Creativity therefore affects and facilitates sustainable development at various stages. It should not be reduced to bringing about new ideas for products, services or procedures. Moreover, the outcomes of this special issue show, that creativity can initialize the change of mindsets and general perspectives on SD. This special issue is a contribution to the ongoing discourse on how to enhance SD.",Schulz K.; Mnisri K.; Shrivastava P.; Sroufe R.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2021-01-01,ICN Business School;Duquesne University;Pennsylvania State University,ARTEM approach ;  Creative sustainability ;  Creativity ;  Innovation ;  Sustainable development ;  Sustainable mindsets

Evaluation Research on Technology Innovation Efficiency of High-End Equipment Manufacturing Based on DEA Malmquist Index Method—Taking Guangdong Province as an Example,"Innovation is the core driving force of high-end equipment manufacturing industry, and the evaluation of its efficiency has important theoretical and practical value. In this paper, taking Guangdong Province as an example, which is a strong province of high-end equipment manufacturing industry in China. DEA Malmquist index method is utilized. Different from other DEA methods, this method is used to study the variation of efficiency, instead of just giving the efficiency value. In order to reduce the repeatability of the existing index system and ensure the scientificity and accuracy of the evaluation results, two new input index parameters, namely, full-time equivalent input of R&D personnel and internal expenditure of R&D funds, were constructed innovatively. The results show that in order to improve the technological innovation efficiency of high-end intelligent manufacturing in Guangdong province, it is not enough to focus on innovation itself, but also to focus on the transformation of innovation achievements.",Wu S.; Li H.; Zhang J.; Fan B.,Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2021-01-01,Wuhan Technology and Business University;Huazhong University of Science and Technology,Data envelopment analysis ;  High-end equipment manufacturing industry ;  Technological innovation efficiency

Use of Sustainable Innovation in Information System: Integrate Individual’s Spirit and Team Climate,"Based on the theories of employee entrepreneurship and team climate, the influencing factors of the aspiration to use the information system are studied, and a structural equation research model including two dimensions of individual and team is constructed. And 201 valid questionnaires were used to verify the model. The research found that the enterprising spirit in the entrepreneurial spirit of employees can directly affect the individual’s aspiration to use it continuously, while pioneering spirit and cooperation can indirectly affect the aspiration to innovation through the mediating effect of attitude to innovations. In addition, the stronger the support for innovation and task orientation in the team, the more it can stimulate employees’ innovation willingness. On this basis, the paper puts forward effective suggestions for the cultivation of employees’ sustainable innovation willingness. Enterprises should create more team atmosphere, cultivate employees’ innovative attitude and the characteristics of entrepreneurship, give employees autonomy in their work, and maximize the influence of employees.",Zhou X.; Zhang Y.; Li X.,Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2021-01-01,Wuhan Technology and Business University;Yunnan University,Employee entrepreneurship ;  Innovation aspiration ;  Sustained use ;  Team climate
Characteristics of changeable systems across value chains,"Engineering changes (ECs) are inevitable for businesses due to increasing innovation, shorter lifecycles, technology and process improvements and cost reduction initiatives. The ECs could propagate and cause further changes due to existing system dependencies, which can be challenging. Hence, change management (CM) is a relevant discipline, which aims to reduce the impact of changes. EC assessment methods form the basis of CM that support in assessing system dependencies and the impact of changes. However, understanding of which factors influence the changeability across value chains (VCs) is limited. This research adopted a VC approach to EC assessment. Dependencies in products and processes were captured, followed by risk (i.e. likelihood x impact) assessment of ECs using change prediction method (CPM). Four industrial case studies were conducted (3x automotive, 1x furniture manufacturing) to identify design (product) and manufacturing (process) elements with high risk to be affected by ECs. Based on the case results, characteristics were identified that influence changeability across VC. This contributed to the CM domain while businesses could also use the results to assess ECs across VC, and improve the design of products and processes by increasing their changeability across VC e.g. by proactive decoupling or reactive handling of system dependencies.",Masood T.; Kern M.; John Clarkson P.,Journal,International Journal of Production Research,2021-01-01,Department of Engineering;University of Cambridge,Changeability ;  design structure matrix ;  engineering change prediction ;  manufacturing ;  product architecture ;  system dependencies
Eco-innovation and its role for performance improvement among Chinese small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises,"Due to the growing public quest for environmental protection, small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises (SMMEs) are under pressure to adopt eco-innovation to improve their operations. However, whether and how eco-innovation efforts can bring performance improvements may rely on the implementation level of eco-innovation and other traditional environmental management (TEM) practices. Drawing on the contingency theory, we develop and empirically test a model which proposes the existence of different firm clusters of SMMEs based on their eco-innovation implementation levels and that the performance improvement associated with eco-innovation practices is contingent on the firm clusters and TEM practices (i.e., internal source reduction, external compliance and communication, and internal management and control). Using survey data collected from 382 SMMEs in China, our cluster analytic results reveal two firm clusters of SMMEs characterized by three types of eco-innovation (technology, management, and marketing) implementation. From the results, we observed eco-innovation adopters involving 225 SMMEs (58.9% of the sample). The rest of 157 SMMEs (41.1% of the sample) are labeled as eco-innovation planners. T-test results show that the implementation levels of eco-innovation and TEM practices, as well as environmental and economic performance improvements, are different between eco-innovation planners and adopters. Results from hierarchical regression analyses further show that implementing certain eco-innovation practices jointly with TEM practices is beneficial for performance improvements. External compliance and communication are helpful for management innovation to bring environmental performance among eco-innovation planners, but it can be detrimental to environmental image together with marketing innovation. For eco-innovation adopters, internal source reduction is helpful for both technology and management innovation to deliver environmental performance. Technology innovation and internal source reduction can jointly bring economic performance improvement among eco-innovation planners, but such joint efforts can weaken the economic performance improvement for eco-innovation adopters. Our paper contributes knowledge on the role of eco-innovation to bring performance gains among SMMEs in China, a major manufacturing hub in Asia servicing global production demands. We also examine the performance contingencies of eco-innovation with TEM practices in the SMMEs, providing practical implications for them to improve operations, as well as policy insights for governments to promote the performance benefits of eco-innovation, particularly targeting for the smaller-sized manufacturers in the industry.",Geng D.; Lai K.; Zhu Q.,Journal,International Journal of Production Economics,2021-01-01,Antai College of Economics and Management;University of Cambridge;The Hong Kong Polytechnic University,Contingency theory ;  Eco-innovation ;  Manufacturing ;  Performance ;  Small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprise
"Risk Analysis for Ethical, Legal and Social Implications of Information and Communication Technologies in the Forestry Sector","The Aachen method for the identification, classification, and risk analysis of innovation-based problems (AMICAI) was employed with relevant stakeholders in order to identify and analyze ethical, legal and social aspects (ELSA) related to the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in the German forestry sector. Based on the problem of different demands due to regional differences and the variety of stakeholders, a need for standards and regularities was reported and a lack of confidence in the functionality of ICT was identified. Hereby, the greatest concern was the insufficient mobile net coverage in the forest. However, problems regarding data protection were most concerning for the participants. Especially an uncertainty regarding data collection and processing was identified. The AMICAI method encouraged stakeholders to change their perspective, which enabled them to understand that their individual problems are interdependent. Thus, it was found that the method can make a substantial contribution towards responsible research and innovation in the field of ICT development.",Brunner O.; Schäfer K.; Mertens A.; Nitsch V.; Brandl C.,Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2021-01-01,Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen,AMICAI ;  ELSA ;  ELSI ;  Forestry sector ;  Information and communication technologies

"Are resource-usage patterns related to achievement? A study of an active, blended, and collaborative learning environment for undergraduate engineering courses","Pedagogical innovations continue to be developed and adopted in engineering education, but how these pedagogical innovations affect the students’ experiences and learning outcomes is not fully understood. This study investigates the extent to which a student's resource-usage pattern relates to their course grade, scores on problem-solving exam questions, and scores on conceptual exam questions in a resource-rich undergraduate dynamics course. The regression analysis indicates that on average a student's resource-usage pattern is not predictive of their achievement, but it also identifies one individual resource-usage pattern that is associated with higher achievement and one pattern that is associated with lower achievement. Based on the resource-usage behaviours of the students exhibiting these two patterns, general resource-usage suggestions for all of the students in the course are developed. This research illustrates the power of investigating the experiences and achievements of specific subgroups of students, not just those of the stereotypical or average student.",Stites N.; Berger E.; DeBoer J.; Rhoads J.,Journal,European Journal of Engineering Education,2021-01-01,Purdue University;University of Colorado Boulder,Cluster analysis ;  conceptual understanding ;  engineering education ;  help-seeking behaviour ;  procedural knowledge
Exploring professional roles for early career engineers: a systematic literature review,"It is recognised that engineers end up in a wide variety of engineering positions and that the importance of professional competencies might vary accordingly. However, most studies regarding professional competencies, employability or career guidance fail to address this variety in professional roles. This systematic literature review aims to identify professional roles for early career engineers and explores the defining attributes. Twenty-four publications were selected for inclusion by screening and appraising results obtained from three databases. Three frameworks that fulfilled the analysing criteria described similar roles focusing on innovation, optimisation and customisation. The majority of studies investigated professional competencies as identifying attributes, but inconsistency in and a lack of definitions hindered to determine the distinct professional competencies per role. Further research is recommended to identify role attributes and to investigate how a professional roles framework can support career development in engineering education, more particular in creating professional and self-awareness.",Craps S.; Pinxten M.; Knipprath H.; Langie G.,Journal,European Journal of Engineering Education,2021-01-01,Leuvens Centrum voor Onderwijs van Ingenieurs en Wetenschappers;KU Leuven,career guidance ;  employability ;  job-fit ;  professional skills ;  skills mismatch ;  systematic review
Optimizing deep learning and neural network to explore enterprise technology innovation model,"The technological innovation capabilities of enterprises have a greater impact on regional economic development, and the evaluation of technological innovation capabilities of enterprises has a certain guiding role in the formulation of regional economic development plans. From the current situation, it can be seen that the technological innovation model of enterprises is affected by various factors. Based on deep learning and neural network technology, this research takes a high-tech park as an example to comprehensively evaluate the innovation ability of the high-tech park. The use of predicted values in some evaluation indicators can better reflect the innovation ability. At the same time, this research uses the historical GDP data of the park to predict future values and uses the predicted values as indicators of innovation ability. Finally, the idea of combined forecasting is used to comprehensively evaluate the technological innovation capability of enterprises. The research results show that the method proposed in this paper has certain predictive power, can provide guidance for regional economic development, and can provide theoretical references for subsequent related research.",Zhen Z.; Yao Y.,Journal,Neural Computing and Applications,2021-01-01,Nanjing Normal University;CDP Group Limited,Deep learning ;  Enterprise technology innovation ;  Model simulation ;  Neural network
Exploration and practical research on teaching reforms of engineering practice center based on 3I-CDIO-OBE talent-training mode,"Education leads to engineering and engineering depends on practice. The Engineering Training Practice Center is a Chinese institution for engineering practice teaching to improve students' practical and engineering capabilities. It also empowers students with innovative abilities and comprehensive engineering literacy. With an increasing number of new challenges and situations, innovating and reforming engineering practice education to meet the development needs has become an important topic in current higher engineering education. On the basis of outcomes-based education (OBE) and conceive–design–implement–operate (CDIO) education models, combined with emerging engineering education (integration, inheritance, and innovation [3I]), a 3I-CDIO-OBE talent-training model for Chinese engineering education is proposed, and the attributes of general, professional, and innovative education were fully accounted for in the engineering practice teaching. A multilevel + multidisciplinary + innovative and practical engineering teaching system has been successfully constructed, which has started achieving the goals, paving a way of thinking to actively explore the engineering practice teaching reforms in colleges and universities.",Chen W.; Lin Y.; Ren Z.; Shen D.,Journal,Computer Applications in Engineering Education,2021-01-01,Fuzhou University,emerging engineering education ;  engineering practice ;  higher engineering education ;  talent-training mode ;  teaching reforms
STEM for Inclusive Excellence and Equity,"Research Findings: Educators declare their commitment to high-quality education for all children. Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) has been increasingly included as critical topics, even for young children. However, there are exceptions, especially the provision of developmentally appropriate STEM experiences to children with disabilities (CWD). In this article, we review evidence concerning this equity gap, including the importance of STEM education to CWD. We find that the early years provide an exceptional opportunity to introduce STEM, but that this potential is often left unrealized, especially for young vulnerable children, who live in poverty, are members of linguistic and ethnic minority groups, or are CWD (some with particular disabilities in STEM domains). Research also indicates the success of some educational approaches. Practice or Policy: Research and development in each of the STEM domains, as well as interdisciplinary approaches provides directions for both policy and practice. For example, both need to change to reflect importance of STEM for all young children, especially CWD, the need to change harmful beliefs, and the positive effects of approaches based on learning trajectories. We conclude with an introduction of a new center to support inclusive innovation in early education in STEM.",Clements D.; Vinh M.; Lim C.; Sarama J.,Journal,Early Education and Development,2021-01-01,The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill;University of Denver,
Ethical issues in service robotics and artificial intelligence,"As we come to increasingly rely on robotic and Artificial Intelligence technologies, there are a growing number of ethical concerns to be considered by both service providers and consumers. This review concentrates on five such issues: (1) ubiquitous surveillance, (2) social engineering, (3) military robots, (4) sex robots, and (5) transhumanism. With the partial exception of transhumanism, all of these areas of AI and robotic service interaction already present ethical issues in practice. But all five areas will raise additional concerns in the future as these technologies develop further. These issues have serious consequences and it is imperative to research and address them now. I outline the relevant literatures that can guide this research. The paper fills a gap in recent work on AI and robotics in services.

"The engineering of food with sustainable development goals:policies, curriculums, business models, and practices","The environmental, nutritional, and socio-economic issues in the globalised agro-industrial food system are at the center of political agendas, reform programmes, and sustainable curriculums in higher education institutions to accelerate the sustainability transition of food sociotechnical systems. Despite the societal importance of these issues there is little proposals aiming to address sustainable development goals in food science and engineering curriculums. However, promoting project-based learning by students on how to develop eco-designed business models and eco-innovated food products seem to be an essential lever for the sustainability transition. This paper describes how a consortium of French agri-food engineering colleges implemented sustainable development goals via the governmental Idefi-EcoTrophelia programme. Through two cases, we show how the students used engineering and managerial knowledge to eco-design business models and to develop entrepreneurial capabilities to establish green ventures to commercialise their innovation. To analyse these projects we propose a sustainable business model canvas that describes the processes through which food eco-innovations were developed and transferred from the research institutions to industries and consumers. This model facilitates understanding how the sustainable development goals transform food sociotechnical systems to create societal values.,.",Serhan H.; Yannou-Lebris G.,Journal,International Journal of Sustainable Engineering,2021-01-01,Université Paris-Saclay,business model innovation ;  eco-innovation ;  ecological transition ;  entrepreneurship ;  higher-education curriculum ;  Sustainable engineering
Improving the innovation ability of engineering students: a Science and Technology Innovation Community organisation network analysis,"Science and Technology Innovation Communities (STICs) are student-led partnerships that bring together businesses, research centres, and university staff. They constitute an effective way of promoting student innovation ability. However, the students’ position within the STICs organisation network may condition how their innovation ability is effectively acquired. Using Social Network Analysis (SNA), this study measures how the STICs organisation network promotes the innovation ability of its actors. The paper finds that network centrality and structural holes of the STICs organisation network are positively correlated with student innovation ability. The results are validated through robustness tests in three different STICs, involving engineering students from China’s Chang’an University. Semi-structured interviews are also conducted with 20 relevant actors of STICs. The conclusion suggests that a higher involvement of core actors, more support from schools, and more restrictive entry requirements are necessary to improve the organisation management and training level of engineering students in STICs.",Zhang J.; Li R.; Li H.; Skitmore M.; Ballesteros-Pérez P.,Journal,Studies in Higher Education,2021-01-01,Birmingham City University;Chang'an University;Universidad de Cádiz;Queensland University of Technology,Engineering education ;  innovation ability ;  Science and Technology Innovation Community (STIC) ;  social network analysis ;  student development
Strategic green technology innovation in a two-stage alliance: Vertical collaboration or co-development?,"Given the increased awareness of the need for environmental protection, developing and selling new energy vehicles has gradually become the primary trend in the automobile industry. Collaborating with battery manufacturers to develop new energy vehicles at a lower cost and with better performance is key for automobile manufacturers to maintain their dominant position. We examine a research and development (R&D) collaboration alliance, consisting of an R&D phase and a sales phase, between an automobile manufacturer (the marketer) and a battery manufacturer (the innovator) to develop and bring an innovative green technology to market. This paper investigates four types of R&D collaboration contracts with different payments: vertical R&D collaboration contracts with either a revenue-sharing payment (Case VR) or a fixed payment (Case VF) and co-development contracts in which either the marketer operates the sales phase (Case CM) or the innovator operates the sales phase (Case CI). Our analysis reveals that no contract is always the best choice from the marketer's perspective. Specifically, the contract preferred by the marketer depends on the trade-off between the R&D efficiency and the sales efficiency of the marketer and the innovator, respectively. Interestingly, becoming involved in the R&D phase is not always in the marketer's best interest, i.e., the marketer does not always prefer the co-development contract. Counterintuitively, we find that the marketer does not always choose to sell the green product, even when its marketing efficiency is high. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, it is more advantageous for the marketer to propose that the innovator sell the green product rather than doing so itself.",Yu X.; Lan Y.; Zhao R.,Journal,Omega (United Kingdom),2021-01-01,Tsinghua University;Tianjin University,Co-development ;  Contract design ;  Green technology innovation ;  Vertical research and development
Motivating first-year engineering students through gamified homework,"Gamification has been applied in multiple different contexts for increasing motivation towards completion of activities such as company loyalty programs, exercise initiatives, and corporate training. Although gamification has been applied within engineering classrooms previously, very little results have been obtained on how gamification approaches can impact student academic motivation. This study applied an action research approach to the development of curricular content for an online gamification platform that could be used for homework in a first-year second semester engineering design course. During the two cycles performed, researchers learned from the students directly what elements of the platform appealed to them and helped with their learning process allowing the researchers to make active changes to the gamification platform throughout the semester as well as in between cycles to improve final outcomes. After completion of the second cycle of analysis, the researchers were able to create content for a gamification platform that has been shown to be able to empower students towards learning engineering material while providing them with the necessary support so that they can feel successful although further refinement based on student comments and feedback is still necessary. Students also felt that the content built into the platform was of interest to them and useful to their overall learning process. This study demonstrated the utility of using action research as a means to actively incorporate student feedback in the development of educational innovations leading to ongoing improvements and a final product that meets the intended needs of its target population.",Kulhanek A.; Butler B.; Bodnar C.,Journal,Educational Action Research,2021-01-01,Henry M.
