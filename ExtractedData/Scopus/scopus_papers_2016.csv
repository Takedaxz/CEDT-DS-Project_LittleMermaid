Pilot study on strategies in sensor placement for robust hand/wrist gesture classification based on movement related changes in forearm volume,"Force Myography (FMG) is novel method of tracking functional motor activity using volumetric changes associated with muscle function. With comparable accuracy and multiple advantages over traditional methods of functional motor activity tracking, FMG has made leaps and bounds in terms of applications in human-machine interfaces and healthcare devices. As a field that is rapidly gaining popularity in health innovation, the aim of this paper is to contribute to our understanding of the nature FMG methods and establish it as a robust and reliable technique. The main point of exploration for this study is the impact of sensor placement and spatial coverage on FMG methods. Five participants were invited to perform a series of isolated wrist motions and hand gestures while wearing custom built FMG devices. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) machine learning models were developed using 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing. Overall, the accuracy of the LDA models ranged from 75% to 100% across all subjects and dimensions of FMG data. The model accuracy improved when increasing the spatial coverage from 1 FMG band to 2, but it did not increase further with additions. The results also showed that the improved accuracy offered by a large spatial coverage of FMG data can be approximated by lower spatial coverage if sensors were place in an optimal location. This location was indicated to be midway between the wrist and the collective muscle bellies of intrinsic forearm muscles. The knowledge generated from this work aims serve as a guide towards the development of portable FMG based technology for widespread deployment in the general population. The hope is that the long-term benefits of continued FMG research will address issues in healthcare associated with disparities in access to medical technologies.",Chengani R.; Delva M.; Sakr M.; Menon C.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 IEEE Healthcare Innovation Point-of-Care Technologies Conference, HI-POCT 2016",2016-12-27,Simon Fraser University,

Sustainability-oriented innovations: Can mindfulness make a difference?,"The concepts of sustainability and innovation represent a fundamental conflict of objectives. This fact may help explain why the management literature has been ambiguous in its approach to sustainability-oriented innovation. The main purpose of this article is to develop an analytical framework to further study the influence of mindfulness. Mindfulness can support the development of the cognitive abilities, attitudes and behaviors of individuals who work within organizations. It can help them identify and utilize creative solutions that can lead to sustainability-oriented innovation. This paper presents a theoretical study that has been designed to support future research in sustainability-oriented innovation in the organizational context. A systematic literature review provides empirical evidence that mindfulness training can promote changes in individual cognition mechanisms that favor creativity and ecological concerns. As an isolated training technique, mindfulness can be used as a tool to reduce the stress that is caused by efficiency-driven business models. To help influence management actions in favor of sustainability-oriented innovation, this paper offers a research agenda that combines the following five fields of study: sufficiency-driven business models, inclusive capitalism, sustainability-oriented innovation capability, mindfulness in organizations and interdisciplinary and qualitative mindfulness.",Siqueira R.; Pitassi C.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2016-12-15,"Instituto Brasileiro de Mercado de Capitais, Rio de Janeiro;Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro",Cognition ;  Creativity ;  Mindfulness ;  Sustainability ;  Sustainability-oriented innovation
"A process integration approach for the production of biological iso-propanol, butanol and ethanol using gas stripping and adsorption as recovery methods","Biomass fermentation to Iso-propanol, Butanol and Ethanol (IBE) is particularly important as IBE is a common building block in the development of biorefineries and IBE-producing bacteria are robust industrial organisms, capable to utilize the sugars of the lignocellulosic biomass. Research is focused on increasing fermentation yields and the reduction of energy that is required to separate the volatile products. The paper addresses both of these challenges combining experimental innovations with a systems engineering approach. IBE is recovered from a gas-stripped fermenter whose potential for adsorption is researched and integrated with downstream options for separation. Design and integration is assisted using a systems approach that relies on mathematical models that regress and extrapolate experimental data for scale-up calculations. Process integration involves synthesis challenges to define biorefinery portfolios and systems integration to combine fermentation, stripping, adsorption, and distillation. The analysis considers 4 alternative biorefinery cases and presents results with significant savings in energy use and costs (up to 87% savings reported) after the application of energy integration to the IBE plant. Scenarios are analysed economically and confirm benefits in the use of adsorption and viable production yields.",Pyrgakis K.; de Vrije T.; Budde M.; Kyriakou K.; López-Contreras A.; Kokossis A.,Journal,Biochemical Engineering Journal,2016-12-15,Wageningen University & Research;National Technical University of Athens (NTUA),"Adsorption ;  Gas stripping ;  In-situ product removal ;  Iso-propanol, Butanol, Ethanol Fermentation ;  Mathematical modelling and process design ;  Process integration"

"How background affects design output: Teaching product development to mechanical engineers, industrial designers and managers","Product design and development is a topic of academic and industrial research, with particular current interest. Emphasis on innovation and entrepreneurship, design thinking and creativity have been recently pulled together into the teaching and research on product design and development. However, the shear breadth of the topic means that there is no single way of teaching and doing research on it. The present paper looks into the similarities and differences across three very similar product development masters courses at three distinct Portuguese higher education institutions - Instituto Superior Tecnico (IST) of the University of Lisbon, Instituto Politecnico do Cavado e Ave (IPCA), and ISCTE business school (IBS) of Instituto Universitario de Lisboa. Product Development and Entrepreneurship is taught at IST mostly for students of mechanical engineering, whereas Advanced Product Development Methodologies is taught at IPCA mostly for industrial design students and New Product Development is taught at ISCTE for business students. All three courses use the same methodology of assessment and the same overall syllabus, with distributed assignments and expected outcomes. However, the nature and emphasis of specific aspects of the students' projects are fundamentally different. The reasons for these differences are analyzed by the faculty involved, in the context of the students' background and goals and examples are given. Conclusions and recommendations are provided at the end.",Silva A.; Da Silva J.; Leite M.; Simoes R.,Conference Proceeding,"CISPEE 2016 - 2nd International Conference of the Portuguese Society for Engineering Education, Proceedings",2016-12-07,Singapore University of Technology and Design;Iscte – Instituto Universitário de Lisboa;Instituto Politécnico do Cávado e do Ave,Design output ;  design teaching ;  industrial design ;  management ;  mechancial engineering

Requirements Engineering as Innovation Journalism: A Research Preview,"The successful launch of an innovation project depends on an attractive vision and how well the vision is supported by the complementary capabilities of the consortium partners that want to cooperate to realize the vision. Alas, for an innovator the search for the right partners and visions can be lengthy and difficult. Even though the analysis of context and problem, the identification of stakeholders, the analysis of stakeholder goals and techno-logical capabilities, and the definition of requirements belong to the cornerstones of requirements engineering, this requirements engineering problem has hardly been explored so far. In an attempt to avoid re-invention of well-tried solutions, we discovered journalism as a discipline that, as a rich body of methodical knowledge, may act as a source for the guidance of how a requirements engineer may support the launch of innovation projects. In the role of a journalist, the requirements engineer makes partners and their capabilities visible and thereby allows the parties to identify each other and meet. The transparency that develops between the parties becomes an instrument for consortia to emerge and to eventually answer calls for innovation with appropriate visions for innovation projects. This paper introduces the problem of initiating innovation projects and describes the potential role of journalism as a metaphor for addressing the problem. The paper also describes our plans in designing an innovation journalism approach that we hope will enable requirements engineers to increase innovation potential and ease the launch of projects that bring about these innovations.",Fricker S.; Wallmüller E.; Paschen I.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2016 IEEE 24th International Requirements Engineering Conference, RE 2016",2016-12-02,Zuhlke Engineering AG;Blekinge Tekniska Högskola;Fachhochschule Nordwestschweiz FHNW;Qualitat and Informatik,design sciences research ;  innovation ;  journalism ;  stakeholder discovery ;  vision-building
ResDevOps: A Software Engineering Framework for Achieving Long-Lasting Complex Systems,"The development of high quality complex software systems and quick time-to-market with full customer satisfaction often appear as two competing forces. Many industry efforts have been directed towards agile methodologies completed with the DevOps approach, whereas traditional requirements engineering with much documentation, is considered surpassed. The aim is to obtain a longer life software because it suddenly responds to the customers changing requirements from which it receives continuous input. This might create a serious cost implication and a real risk to lose system requirements control. In this paper, we propose a framework able to govern the complexity of the system requirements and to allow the embedding, occasionally, of technological innovations into the overall system. ResDevOps joins the value of the agile world with DevOps, with the additional value deriving from an unceasing parallel innovation management process, which we call ResDevs. ResDevOps includes a continuous research and innovation process, which provides an asynchronous, additional input to the agile process inside a chain of concurrent engineering collaboration. This is a suitable trade-off to maintain modern IT Systems live for a longer time, with many consequent advantages for both total investment and system quality. The practical use of the ResDevOps approach is shown by means of a case study.",Furfaro A.; Gallo T.; Garro A.; Saccà D.; Tundis A.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2016 IEEE 24th International Requirements Engineering Conference, RE 2016",2016-12-02,Università della Calabria;OKT Srl;Herzum Software Solution Center - Srl,Concurrent Software Engineering ;  Enterprise Information Systems ;  Goal-Oriented Methodologies ;  Requirements Engineering ;  Software Development Methodologies

Robot development project with human- and eco-friendly smart materials,"The social need for robotic technology is rapidly increasing to prepare for the aging society in Japan. Many political action plans concerning Japan’s robot strategy have been proposed and carried out nationwide. This project focused on the social implementation of life support robots and developing corresponding robotic technology. The project’s participants were mainly selected from four laboratories in the department of Mechanical Engineering of Kanagawa University. In addition to robotic technology, there was participation and collaboration in this project from several specialized fields of mechanical engineering, such as material properties, material development, and mechanical vibration. Developing academia–industry–government collaboration was another key project aim. Prior to this project, joint research on dynamics and design concerning mechanical vibration and noise has been undertaken since 2011 by Kanagawa University and Kanagawa Industrial Technology Center. Based on this experience in project-based research, we extended our collaborative research, and the joint research project “Robot development project with human- and eco-friendly smart materials” started in April 2012 and ended in March 2014. In this paper, we report the research activities and results for this collaboration within the regional research community. First, we introduce the project planning. We discuss the relationship between the main theme of robotic technology and the subthemes, determined by the expertise of the members. We considered the safety and reliability of robotic technology in addition to developing materials and robot mechanics. In particular, we decided to pursue participation from fields that do not always engage directly with robotic technology. Second, we outline how we determined the subthemes of the project and we examine the contribution of each subtheme to the results of the main project. Moreover, we discuss our future development work. Finally, as a first step to implementing robotic technology in the regional social system, we report a recognition survey about the practical use and materials of robots that was performed among small and medium-sized enterprises related to robotic technology in the Kanagawa area. Through the survey, we improved the development and direction of the project. Furthermore, the exhibition “Robot Innovation 2012” held in the Tokyo International Exhibition Center communicated our project results to the public.",Itoh Y.; Yamazaki T.; Lim H.; Takemura K.,Journal,ROBOMECH Journal,2016-12-01,Kanagawa Institute of Industrial Science and Technology;Kanagawa University,Academia–industry–government collaboration ;  Human- and eco-friendly ;  Material properties ;  Mechanical vibration ;  Robot impact reduction system ;  Smart ;  Social activities
Advances in Bio-inspired Tribology for Engineering Applications,"Bio-inspired tribology is an interdisciplinary field of science where scientists and engineers seek to investigate and incorporate tribological properties encountered in biological beings into engineering applications. In this paper, bio-inspired tribological research that are speculated to have a huge impact on tribological applications have been reviewed. These research involve (1) investigations related to replication of lubricin found in synovial fluids of mammalian joints which have super-low friction values that can be utilized in IC engines, (2) surface replication concerning to superhydrophobic properties of gecko skin which is seen to have anti-wetting and self-cleaning properties, (3) friction-reducing shark skin through specialized nanoparticle coatings that is seen to give a different perspective on surface texturing, (4) new techniques, such as soft lithography to replicate surfaces of lotus leaf and air lubrication phenomenon inspired by emperor penguins that is being applied to propel boats, ships, and torpedoes faster by reducing skin friction underwater. Further, an investigation in self-healing materials inspired from pitcher plant that has led to the innovation of self-healing and slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces has been discussed. These research works reviewed not only provide a deep insight into the current advances in bio-inspired tribology but also helps understand the plausibility of the research applications in the future and the practicality of innovations possible.",Siddaiah A.; Menezes P.,Journal,Journal of Bio- and Tribo-Corrosion,2016-12-01,College of Engineering,Air lubrication ;  Bio-mimetic tribology ;  Boundary lubrication ;  Hydrogels ;  Skin friction ;  Super-hydrophobicity

Information Technology and Public Health: Possibilities for Innovation through Interdisciplinary Actions,"The new technologies of information and communication permeate our daily lives in various contexts. This reality allows us to reflect on the use of technology as a mechanism for the development of innovative solutions to various problems affecting society. In this sense, this work presents some tools that contribute to the solution of a serious public health problem, common in tropical countries: the monitoring of breeding sites of the Aedes aegypti mosquito larvae, vector of diseases such as dengue, Zika virus, yellow fever and Chikungunya fever. In its larval stage, this mosquito uses containers with stagnant water as breeding sites. The localization and elimination of breeding sites, together with the guidance to the population, is an effective way to combat mosquitoes and reduce the number of cases of infected individuals. To do so, it was developed and made available to the population in general, a set of technological tools, based on ""apps"" for smartphones, through which anyone can indicate breeding sites of mosquito larvae. In addition to an app for the geographic markup of breeding sites, there is also another app and a website that allows everyone to view the marked sites, making it possible to build a geographic representation for the distribution of Aedes larvae breeding sites. In a pilot test, it was possible to verify that the use of new technologies in controlling and monitoring of insects that are considered vectors of diseases is significantly efficient. It was generated a considerable volume of information that enables the development of control strategies and actions to combat the vector in question by the competent authorities. Also, this pilot test involved a large number of persons: undergraduate students and teachers from information technology and health areas, public professionals that are responsible for epidemiological monitoring and the population in general. Indirectly, the implementation of these technological tools promoted the interdisciplinary integration among teachers and students in the areas of information technology and public health in a Brazilian university. Similarly, the project also integrated university, population and the government around the purpose of controlling the advancement of diseases that have caused severe negative impacts on society. It was concluded that the rational use of new technologies, pointing towards solving problems that affect society, is able to provide innovative solutions, promoting the construction of interdisciplinary actions in education, integrating different areas of knowledge and these with competent agencies and society in general.",Camargo J.; Camargo E.; Veraszto E.; Barreto G.; Aceti P.; Junior A.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Computer Science,2016-12-01,Universidade Estadual de Campinas;Universidade Federal de São Carlos;Centro Regional Universitario de E.

Managing Interorganizational Innovation Projects: Mitigating the Negative Effects of Equivocality Through Knowledge Search Strategies,"Equivocality, or divergent interpretations and understandings of tasks and knowledge, has negative effects on performance because it increases conflicts and creates communication and coordination challenges in inter-organizational innovation projects. However, equivocality may also stimulate team members to discuss beliefs and interpretations in ways that provide improved understanding of knowledge and tasks. We theorize that mitigation of negative effects of equivocality on project performance is conditional on explorative or exploitative knowledge search mode. Exploitative search (increasing search depth) allows for rapid learning based on the partners’ existing knowledge, but it also limits a team's ability to interpret and combine diverse knowledge. Explorative search (increasing search breadth), on the other hand, allows for novel combinations of diverse knowledge and thereby alleviates the negative effect of equivocality on performance. Based on quantitative data from 251 respondents in 52 heavy-engineering innovation projects in four multinational corporations based in Sweden and from their 29 collaborating partner firms worldwide, we find that equivocality reduces project performance, but that joint explorative search mitigates the negative effect of equivocality on project performance. However, we do not find support for the moderation effect of exploitative search on the relationship between equivocality and project performance. Theoretical and managerial contributions as well as limitations and suggestions for future research are presented.",Eriksson P.; Patel P.; Sjödin D.; Frishammar J.; Parida V.,Journal,Long Range Planning,2016-12-01,,
Regenerative medicine: Looking backward 10 years further on,"The last decade has seen considerable changes in the Regenerative Medicine industry, but unfortunately the hope for numerous treatments that 'replace or regenerate human cells, tissues or organs to restore or establish normal function' has not yet emerged. In contrast to this, there have been major advances in the field of cellular immunotherapy though some do not consider these to be Regenerative Medicines. Regulatory changes have in some cases improved the route to a marketing license but they have not been matched by clarification of the complex, national reimbursement processes for cell-based treatments and this has adversely affected a number of leading Regenerative Medicine Companies. The review considers the direction that the industry may go in the future in relation to scientific, manufacturing and clinical strategies which may improve the rate of success of new therapies..",Kemp P.,Journal,Regenerative Medicine,2016-12-01,HairClone,ATMP ;  CAR-T cells ;  cellular immunotherapy ;  iPS cell ;  medical innovation ;  regenerative medicine ;  review

Measuring the impact of Japanese local public hospital reform on national medical expenditure via panel data regression,"Local public hospitals (LPH) in Japan were established to secure equal accessibility and to improve quality for the health care system by providing policy-based medical services. Difficulties faced by the LPHs challenged the equal accessibility of the health care system and the improvement of their financial situation. We try to investigate the impact of LPH burden on the health care system and attempt to repair the problems confronting LPHs in order to attain the higher health care quality based upon the technology innovation. Panel data regression is used to analyze the effect of proportion of LPH beds and an indicator of LPH burden on hospital personnel numbers and also on estimated national medical expenditure (ENME) using the data from 2005 to 2010 for 47 prefectures in Japan. Hospital personnel, a major supply-side indicator, increased more in prefectures shouldering smaller burden of LPH beds. Prefectural ENME, an important demand-side indicator composing of medical expenditure based on the location of medical facilities, tends to decrease with increasing prefectural LPH burden. The results indicate that patients in the prefectures carrying more LPH burden tend to seek health care in the prefectures bearing less LPH burden during the research period. These imbalances substantially increase after the LPH reform.",Xing Z.; Oyama T.,Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2016-12-01,National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,Health care quality ;  Health care system ;  Local public hospital ;  National medical expenditure ;  Panel data regression ;  Technology innovation
Innovations and Challenges in Project-Based STEM Education: Lessons from ITEST,"For over a decade, the National Science Foundation’s Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program has funded researchers and educators to build an understanding of best practices, contexts, and processes contributing to K-12 students’ motivation and participation in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) activities that lead to STEM career pathways. The outcomes from these projects have contributed significantly to the national body of knowledge about strategies, successes, models, and interventions that support and encourage youth to pursue STEM careers. While the individual projects discussed in this special issue vary by geographic location, institution, populations served, primary focus, and topic, they are unified by ITEST’s programmatic intent and goals. This issue offers research-based insights into the knowledge generated by a decade of ITEST-funded work in STEM career development. The articles describe a multitude of approaches to project design, evaluation, and empirical research. Collectively, they contribute to the development of frameworks for STEM education and workforce development that are increasingly relevant for educators, project designers, researchers, and policy makers. The ITEST program has enabled creativity, experimentation, and cultural responsiveness in STEM education and workforce development and broadened participation in STEM initiatives to Native American communities, underresourced urban communities, girls, and populations underrepresented in STEM fields. By approaching research and evaluation with flexibility and resourcefulness, the authors provide empirical evidence for the value of innovative approaches to STEM education that promote STEM interest and career-related outcomes and that build the foundational skills of the scientific and engineering workforce of the future.",Connors-Kellgren A.; Parker C.; Blustein D.; Barnett M.,Journal,Journal of Science Education and Technology,2016-12-01,Boston College;STEM Learning and Research (STELAR) Center at EDC,ITEST ;  Science education ;  STEM career development ;  STEM education ;  STEM engagement ;  Workforce innovation
Recent advancements in regenerative dentistry: A review,"Although human mouth benefits from remarkable mechanical properties, it is very susceptible to traumatic damages, exposure to microbial attacks, and congenital maladies. Since the human dentition plays a crucial role in mastication, phonation and esthetics, finding promising and more efficient strategies to reestablish its functionality in the event of disruption has been important. Dating back to antiquity, conventional dentistry has been offering evacuation, restoration, and replacement of the diseased dental tissue. However, due to the limited ability and short lifespan of traditional restorative solutions, scientists have taken advantage of current advancements in medicine to create better solutions for the oral health field and have coined it “regenerative dentistry.” This new field takes advantage of the recent innovations in stem cell research, cellular and molecular biology, tissue engineering, and materials science etc. In this review, the recently known resources and approaches used for regeneration of dental and oral tissues were evaluated using the databases of Scopus and Web of Science. Scientists have used a wide range of biomaterials and scaffolds (artificial and natural), genes (with viral and non-viral vectors), stem cells (isolated from deciduous teeth, dental pulp, periodontal ligament, adipose tissue, salivary glands, and dental follicle) and growth factors (used for stimulating cell differentiation) in order to apply tissue engineering approaches to dentistry. Although they have been successful in preclinical and clinical partial regeneration of dental tissues, whole-tooth engineering still seems to be far-fetched, unless certain shortcomings are addressed.",Amrollahi P.; Shah B.; Seifi A.; Tayebi L.,Journal,Materials Science and Engineering C,2016-12-01,"College of Engineering, Architecture and Technology;University of Oxford;Marquette University School of Dentistry",3D bio-printing ;  Dental tissue engineering ;  Gene therapy ;  Regenerative dentistry ;  Stem cells
Knowledge creation and dissemination by Kosetsushi in sectoral innovation systems: insights from patent data,"Public institutes for testing and research called Kosetsushi constitute an important component of regional innovation policies in Japan. They are organized as a technology diffusion program to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) improve productivity through various technology transfer activities. Using comprehensive patent data, this study quantitatively evaluates technology transfer activities of Kosetsushi from the perspective of sectoral innovation systems. The key findings can be summarized as follows. First, local SMEs’ technological portfolios (the distribution of patents across technological fields) indicate a better fit with those of Kosetsushi than with those of local universities. This tendency is salient for manufacturing Kosetsushi. Second, Kosetsushi collaborate on research with local SMEs compared to local universities. This tendency is salient for manufacturing Kosetsushi. Third, in regions where SMEs’ innovative activities concentrate in biotechnology, Kosetsushi are likely to engage in licensing. In regions where SMEs’ innovative activities concentrate in mechanical engineering, Kosetsushi are likely to engage in technical consultation. Fourth, the successful commercialization of Kosetsushi patents relies on both understanding of technological needs of local SMEs and upgrading scientific quality of Kosetsushi researchers. Policy and research implications are discussed.",Fukugawa N.,Journal,Scientometrics,2016-12-01,Tohoku University,Innovation ;  Intermediaries ;  Japan ;  Patents ;  Sectoral innovation systems ;  SMEs ;  Technology transfer
"An introduction to optimal power flow: Theory, formulation, and examples","The set of optimization problems in electric power systems engineering known collectively as Optimal Power Flow (OPF) is one of the most practically important and well-researched subfields of constrained nonlinear optimization. OPF has enjoyed a rich history of research, innovation, and publication since its debut five decades ago. Nevertheless, entry into OPF research is a daunting task for the uninitiated—both due to the sheer volume of literature and because OPF's ubiquity within the electric power systems community has led authors to assume a great deal of prior knowledge that readers unfamiliar with electric power systems may not possess. This article provides an introduction to OPF from an operations research perspective; it describes a complete and concise basis of knowledge for beginning OPF research. The discussion is tailored for the operations researcher who has experience with nonlinear optimization but little knowledge of electrical engineering. Topics covered include power systems modeling, the power flow equations, typical OPF formulations, and common OPF extensions.",Frank S.; Rebennack S.,Journal,IIE Transactions (Institute of Industrial Engineers),2016-12-01,National Renewable Energy Laboratory;Colorado School of Mines,electric power systems analysis ;  electrical engineering ;  nonlinear programming ;  operations research ;  optimal power flow ;  optimization ;  Power flow

The process proposed in this research paper was applied in a case study in which two health-related LOs were developed. Results: The process proposed in this study is called Learning Objects Development Process - LODPRO. This work contributes to both theory and practice in the development of LOs, a field in which innovative techniques such as Design Thinking and the Business Model Canvas are fundamental. Conclusions: Based on these results, we conclude that the present study offers a significant contribution to both theory and practice in this field. If used as a method to develop LOs that focus innovation, the techniques of Design Thinking and Business Model Canvas become fundamental parts of the process.",Queiros L.; da Silveira D.; da Silva Correia-Neto J.; Vilar G.,Journal,Journal of the Brazilian Computer Society,2016-12-01,Universidade Federal de Pernambuco;Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco,Innovation in software design ;  Learning objects ;  Software engineering
Designing the Game: How a Project-Based Media Production Program Approaches STEAM Career Readiness for Underrepresented Young Adults,"Numerous studies have indicated a need for a diverse workforce that is more highly educated in STEM and ICT fields, and one that is capable of responding creatively to demands for continual innovation. This paper, in response, chronicles the implementation of the Digital Pathways (DP) program, a two-time ITEST recipient and an ongoing initiative of the Bay Area Video Coalition. DP has provided low-income, underrepresented minority young people with 180 contact hours of activities in digital media production to prepare them to pursue higher education and technology careers. A design-based research approach synthesizes staff interviews with student observations, interviews and artifacts to identify a set of generalizable best practices or design principles for empowering young people to move from being consumers of digital media to producers. These principles are illustrated with a case study of the 3D Animation and Gaming track from the second ITEST grant. Researchers argue for the importance of attending to the noncognitive elements of learning and illustrate ways in which instructors encouraged creative expression, personal agency, and collaboration through long-term projects. They also identify strategies for sustaining young people’s participation through the establishment of a supportive community environment.",Bass K.; Hu Dahl I.; Panahandeh S.,Journal,Journal of Science Education and Technology,2016-12-01,"Rockman et al;Bay Area Video Coalition, Inc.",Digital media production ;  Gaming ;  Science Technology Engineering Arts and Mathematics (STEAM) ;  Twenty-first-century skills ;  Workforce development
Applying action research in CAD teaching to improve the learning experience and academic level,"A project involving innovation in university education is described in this paper. It was implemented in a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) course on the Bachelor’s Degree in Industrial Design and Product Development Engineering. Several studies have been published about CAD curricula, yet to the best of our knowledge nothing on applying Action Research (AR) to CAD teaching. The project was carried out over a two-year period, after detecting that academic results were not very good even when the course was not very demanding. In the first year, an experiment based on the AR methodology was planned and put into practice. We took the figure of the teacher-researcher as our own, owing to our conviction that teachers themselves must study their own work and reflect on it critically. Encouraged by the good results, throughout the following year, more changes were made in order to further improve the learning experience. The main actions were to develop self-learning material and to use rubrics for assessment, together with an increase in the level of difficulty in some parts of the evaluation. A detailed chronological description of the actions that were carried out, the implied motivations and both the expected results and those actually obtained are presented.",Gracia-Ibáñez V.; Vergara M.,Journal,International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education,2016-12-01,Universidad Jaume I,Action Research methodology ;  CAD ;  improving academic results ;  level of difficulty
Breakthrough R&D Stakeholders: The Challenges of Legitimacy in Highly Uncertain Projects,"We studied the management of internal R&D stakeholders and their involvement dynamics in breakthrough R&D projects. Building on a longitudinal research partnership with a global car manufacturer since 2005, this research highlights the important dynamics of involvement among internal R&D stakeholders in the engineering development organization. Some stakeholders—who served as experts, innovation design strategists, or internal collaboration strategists—succeeded in involving the individuals needed for the project's progress, sometimes generating an over-commitment. The success of the rationale of these stakeholders on engineering resource involvement depended on the perceived legitimacy of their owners.",Hooge S.; Dalmasso C.,Journal,Project Management Journal,2016-12-01,Mines Paris - PSL,breakthrough R&D projects ;  legitimacy ;  resources allocation ;  stakeholder management
Societal impact of synthetic biology: Responsible research and innovation (RRI),"Synthetic biology is an emerging field at the interface between biology and engineering, which has generated many expectations for beneficial biomedical and biotechnological applications. At the same time, however, it has also raised concerns about risks or the aim of producing new forms of living organisms. Researchers from different disciplines as well as policymakers and the general public have expressed the need for a form of technology assessment that not only deals with technical aspects, but also includes societal and ethical issues. A recent and very influential model of technology assessment that tries to implement these aims is known as RRI (Responsible Research and Innovation). In this paper, we introduce this model and its historical precursor strategies. Based on the societal and ethical issues which are presented in the current literature, we discuss challenges and opportunities of applying the RRI model for the assessment of synthetic biology.",Gregorowius D.; Deplazes-Zemp A.,Journal,Essays in Biochemistry,2016-11-30,Universität Zürich,

"Analyzing the perception, judgment and understanding of Ethics among engineering students in higher education","The Royal Academy of Engineering, which is Britain's national academy for engineering, identifies and stresses the importance of personal and professional commitments and obligations of professional engineers to enhance the wellbeing of the society. These can be attained by adopting the highest standards of professional conduct and integrity which are now commonly represented as 'Engineering Ethics'. The engineering profession requires the exploitation of knowledge, resources and innovation and in the process; engineers face different complex situations and scenarios that regularly test their ethical judgment and understanding. A lot of emphasis is therefore placed today on familiarizing engineers with the ethical standards and moral codes of conduct involved in an organization as part of their commitment towards their roles. However, there is very little research conducted so far on the influence of Ethics Education on the moral growth of engineering students. Some recent studies suggest a growing concern among universities on the issue of increasing the ethical knowledge among their students and produce ethically responsible engineers or business leaders. Can Engineering Ethics Education reinforce students' inclination to act ethically and give a strong foundation to their ethical decision making skills? Some researchers seem to imply that students who attend an ethics based course or module are more likely to recognize the core of a moral issue in a given complex situation than students who haven't had any such prior experience. Other researchers seem to disagree on that context. There is also a degree of uncertainty and inconsistency as to how Ethics related courses can be incorporated and delivered as part of an Engineering curriculum. It is also not clear at what stage should engineering students be exposed to ethics courses? This study aims to bring clarity in some of these areas by examining the perception and decision making skills among two groups of students: one which has attended a course on ethics and the other which hasn't. It uses the example of the MSc Engineering Management Programme at York where a session on Engineering Ethics is delivered every year. This study will analyze the potential of Ethics Education in boosting a student's ethical responsibility, awareness and decision making skills.",Atesh M.; Ward T.; Baruah B.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 15th International Conference on Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training, ITHET 2016",2016-11-28,University of York,Engineering Ethics ;  Ethical decision makers ;  Higher Education ;  Royal Academy of Engineering
Classifying knowledge-sharing barriers by organisational structure in order to find ways to remove these barriers,"Research in knowledge management (KM) has recently revealed that barriers to knowledge sharing (KS) can significantly influence KS and reduce creativity. KS is a critical contributor to creativity and innovation among individuals in organizations. This paper introduces a framework using the Lotus Blossom technique to classify KS barriers. This technique emphasizes the power of brainstorming on the field of interest by the application of a visual representation of ideas. An exploration of steps to classify barriers is discussed. One of the key aims of the framework is to ensure that barriers can be classified in ways that best identify in order to find ways to remove them. A review of a large number of KM articles in the literature has identified 160 barriers to KS in a variety of organizations. These were classified into eight themes: Social, Individual, Culture, Technology, Political, Organization, Content, and Routine, procedure and process. The paper, then, discussed the most significant barriers to KS: Psychological ownership, Lack of a motivation, Lack of trust, Lack of incentive and reward systems, Lack of organization culture, Lack of leadership, Lack of technical support, Insufficient technology infrastructure. Implications and future research in this area are also proposed.",Phung V.; Hawryszkiewycz I.; Binsawad M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2016 8th International Conference on Knowledge and Systems Engineering, KSE 2016",2016-11-28,University of Technology Sydney;King Abdulaziz University,Knowledge management ;  Knowledge sharing barriers ;  Knowledge sharing enablers ;  Lotus Blossom technique
SKUNKWORKS-An educational framework for the mediation of reactions,"In the context of today's ubiquitous digital revolution, the mundane product, ranging from toys to watches to entire architectures, is slowly ceasing to exist. They are being replaced by networked and environmentally-reactive objects that, though trying to become dematerialised, require more knowledge of smart materials than ever before. These new products that blur the boundary between object and service integrate a variety of conductive and semi-smart materials to become innovative and intelligent. However, knowledge of these materials is traditionally reserved to the engineering sector and as a result, the products are augmented by technology, rather than being integrally designed from the start with an understanding of material behavior and its potential. By adapting concepts to achieve maximum impact in research and true innovation from the example set by the Lockheed group in their revolutionary working environment Skunkworks, we introduced digital tools and work flows into the classroom to create a competitive and inspiring design environment. In the context of the School of Creative Media, City University of Hong Kong, the project allowed a pedagogical re-structuring of large classes to work on a project based on a hands-on approach in the prototypical confluence of digital 3D printing and smart materials. Ultimately, this approach allowed students to reverse the development process: instead of asking ""How do I make this?"" they had to ask ""What can I make from this?"" Finding this inherent potential in materials and developing it was organizationally framed by a series of digital tooling workshops, and a course outline that traversed through understanding natural forces, analyzing the unique properties of the reaction as a timebased media, and explorations into capture technologies and tools beyond normal cameras. This allowed mediating the reaction through either image or form. In this paper, we will describe the set-up and organizational structure of the course, the variety of teaching materials, assignments, dissemination and finally the exhibition of the students work in the context of the 22nd International Symposium on Electronic Arts in Hong Kong 2016.",Hessels S.; Klein T.,Conference Proceeding,SA 2016 - SIGGRAPH ASIA 2016 Symposium on Education,2016-11-28,City University of Hong Kong,Digital fabrication ;  Experimental teaching ;  Film ;  Mediation ;  Smart materials ;  Tooling

Exploring differences in perceived innovative thinking skills between first year and upperclassmen engineers,"This paper addresses the question of how undergraduate engineering students view the concept of innovation and their own innovative abilities. The study took a mixed methods approach that included both a survey and focus groups to explore this question. The survey revealed significant differences in how fourth year and first year students rated their innovative thinking skills, where the fourth year students believed themselves to be more innovative. To understand why these differences exist, the research team conducted separate focus groups with upperclassmen and first year students. The two age groups defined innovation similarly, but the first year students associated innovative thinking more closely with engineering design. The upperclassmen mostly viewed their innovative thinking skills through their experiences in extracurricular activities. These differences suggest a need to incorporate innovative thinking more intentionally into engineering classrooms.",Davis K.; Amelink C.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2016-11-28,Virginia Tech College of Engineering,First year students ;  Innovation ;  Innovative thinking
More by luck than good judgement: Moral purpose in engineering education policy making for change,"Since the end of the Second World War there has been a considerable growth in knowledge in what engineering education is about. This has been accompanied by a number of reports, particularly in the US, that to some extent are repetitive but in the language of the period. These reports were to a large extent based on informed opinion. These beliefs are deeply entrenched in Western Psyche and encompass beliefs about what students should learn, how they learn and how they should be taught. These views are obtained early being formed by the long experience of elementary, post-elementary and higher education and are often difficult to shift without a substantial chocs des opinions. Policy making is often made on the basis of opinion that has been informed by experience that makes itself into a self-fulfilling hypothesis that shuts out anything that is likely to create a dissonance. One consequence has been a growth of a gap between those who practice in classrooms and those who do educational research. In no other area of inquiry is the vast body of knowledge that is available on the theory and practice of education, theory taken in the broadest meaning of the term, ignored by those who make policy and practice in the classroom. It is contended here that that is morally irresponsible, and the fact that policy makers and practitioners do not have personal philosophies and theories of learning based on that world of knowledge is one of the causes of friction between these two groups. Decisions that work do so more by good luck, than good judgement. All should have received substantial training on which to build their advice, or consult with those undertaking research, and more particularly indicate research they think should be done. A not infrequent complaint is that teachers do not adapt to this or that learning strategy or use this or that particular tool (e.g. concept inventory). At the 2015 ASEE annual conference the representative of ABET lamented that academics had not used the assessment system to innovate. It is contended that innovation is unlikely in the absence of substantial prior knowledge that can enable an innovation to be progressed. It is similarly contended that the friction caused by the ABET proposals cannot be resolved without attention to knowledge that exists in the area of accreditation and assessment. The purpose of this paper is to review some of that research and scholarship as it relates to the proposition that university courses should produce graduates who are able to take up positions in industry without further training.",Heywood J.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2016-11-28,Trinity College Dublin,Assessment ;  Competency ;  Industry ;  Moral intent ;  Policy ;  Research ;  Training
"The connected learner: Engaging faculty to connect computing students to peers, profession and purpose","The Connected Learner is a re-orientation of undergraduate computing education that focuses on connecting students to peers, the profession, and purpose. The College of Computing and Informatics at UNC Charlotte-comprised of three departments with an undergraduate enrollment of approximately 1,500 students-is a large research institution in an urban setting with a diverse student population. Within this unique context, the project aim is to build a sustainable practice of educational innovation across the undergraduate computing curriculum by increasing faculty awareness of teaching innovations, resources for pedagogical change, and support for teaching practices that engage students. The vision is to create an active learning environment that transforms the student entering the computing undergraduate program from a person with an interest in computing to a person with an affinity identity [1] as a computing professional through these ongoing connections. We employ a systems theory of change for the Connected Learner based on two foundational concepts: flipped classrooms and engagement theory. To achieve related goals of improving student retention and time to graduation, Connected Learner teaching strategies are being integrated across the undergraduate curriculum with an initial focus on introductory gateway courses. Change is occurring via infrastructure supports to sustain learning practices across our college through faculty development initiatives (hiring, training, mentoring, and incentives) that are designed to inform faculty about engagement pedagogies, motivate faculty to adopt these practices, and shift pedagogical attitudes. During the first year of the five-year project, quantitative and qualitative data from students and faculty was collected and analyzed. This data provides a baseline of student attitudes and performance as well as a baseline of faculty attitudes and teaching practices. In this paper, we present the background, context, organizational structure, and research questions for the project. Findings from Year 1 are discussed, including academic outcomes, project milestones, and student attitudes towards new teaching practices. Long-term project goals and expectations are presented.",Maher M.; Cukic B.; Mays L.; Rogelberg S.; Latulipe C.; Payton J.; Rorrer A.; Frevert T.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2016-11-28,College of Computing and Informatics,Active learning ;  Computer science education ;  Faculty development ;  Pedagogy ;  Student engagement
Engineering the engineering program: The year of discovery,"Retention is an issue that has been faced by many engineering colleges due to the difficulties and lack of knowledge about what it really is to be an engineer. The first 3 years of the course are particularly intense and hard. A way to overcome this period might be achieved by implementing a new kind of course, more enticing and dynamic. That is the idea of COPEC's engineering education research team, to embed a program with a more interesting activity for students in the first year. It is what has been named after ""The Year of Discovery"", a short-term workshop in order to show students the possibilities of performing as engineers in a global environment - a project developed for a private university, in order to decrease the retention rate in their engineering programs.",Da Rocha Brito C.; Ciampi M.; Barros V.; Amaral L.; Vasconcelos R.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2016-11-28,Universidade do Minho;World Council on Systems Engineering and Technology Information;Science and Education Research Council;Computer Graphics Center - CCG;Science and Education Research Council - COPEC,Innovations ;  International skills ;  Project development ;  Real world work ;  Retention
Do differences exist between how engineering and non-engineering lecturers perceive the importance of teaching competences?,"A survey we conducted a few years ago concluded that higher education teachers should have the following competences: interpersonal, methodological, communicative, planning and management, teamwork and innovation. The authors of this work belong to the Institute in charge of the lecturer-training program at our university, which is basically a technical one. In order to improve our training program, we pose the following research questions: What are the competences that lecturers perceive as less important. Do our university teachers (engineering teachers) have a different perception of the importance of the different lecturer competences compared to that of other teachers? The results we present in this paper come from a survey that was sent to a total of 15,209 teachers belonging to public universities in our community, and we received a total of 2,347 valid answers. As a result of this study, we found which competences are those with a significantly bad rating by lecturers in general, and our lecturers in particular. We analyze what measures should be introduce into our teacher-training program.",Perez-Poch A.; López D.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2016-11-28,Universitat Politécnica de Catalunya,Engineering education ;  Lecturer competences ;  Teachers perception
Academic coaching tools for increased retention: Empowering engineering students in their education,"What skills can we use to help undergraduate and graduate engineering students to set and work toward their own goals, to take charge of their education and career path, and to hold themselves accountable all without adding more to the workload for faculty and support staff? Learn how to empower engineering undergraduate and graduate students to own their education, utilizing tools in coaching. Inherent in the structure of coaching is the engineering design process: identify the underlying problem, explore solutions, and create an action plan. Using coaching skills with students you advise, teach, mentor, supervise, etc. can be a valuable tool for inspiring critical thinking and self-reflection and for improving student retention. Drawing parallels to the success of coaching in business, coaching tools can be used in higher education to empower students in professional and academic skills, as well as in areas relevant to a successful engineering career (e.g., taking initiative, embracing risk, innovation skills). In the case of underrepresented groups in engineering (e.g., women and by ethnicity), a coaching approach can help these populations see negative assumptions they might be making about themselves that are actually a result of cultural/societal norms or implicit bias at work. With that understanding the student can then progress with the coach to come up with goals and action plans to persist in spite of bias. Workshop engagement consists of definitions of and research behind coaching, a sample coaching session, and introduction to coaching tools. Small group discussion and coaching practice with peers is integrated throughout. Workshop activities and materials are drawn from research in fields of education, psychology, diversity and inclusion, and brain science, and from the practice of coaching in business and education contexts. Participants in this highly interactive workshop will: (1) Learn about and practice coaching skills to help you grow as an educator, leader, mentor, supervisor, director.; (2) Practice formulating thought-provoking questions and improving listening skills; (3) Draw parallels to inquiry-based learning and design procedures prevalent in STEM fields to help to foster problemsolving and critical thinking skills in students; (4) Identify specific ways that you can adapt and use coaching strategies in your higher education roles and everyday life. In aligning with FIE goals, this workshop will combine an innovative educational approach for engineering with research from diverse fields. Higher education is on the precipice of involving coaching strategies beyond a subset of academic advisors trained in some coaching skills (known as appreciative advising).

This workshop also embraces the FIE philosophy of sharing ideas, learning about developments and interacting with colleagues in these fields.",Groh J.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2016-11-28,Purdue University,
I-Corps™ for Learning: Sustaining and scaling STEM education innovations for impact,"Currently there is a lot of emphasis on engineering education research and innovation. In 2014 NSF funded a pilot implementation of the NSF Innovation Corps for Learning (I-Corps™ L) and additional cohorts have been conducted and are planned. The 7-week I-Corps™ L program uses established strategies for start-ups to scale up and move teaching and learning innovations into broad practice. Participating teams go through a hypothesis-testing, scientific method of discovery to gather important insights and identify issues associated with their projects. Unfortunately, the reach of the program is limited as a maximum of 24 teams can participate in each course offering. This special session provides an opportunity for a broad cross-section of researchers and educators to gain exposure to the Lean Start Up approach and its applicability to STEM education ecosystem. The focus of the session is to introduce the core features of the Lean Start Up process: search for a sustainable and scalable model using the Business Model Canvas, Customer Discovery, and Agile Engineering (i.e., iterate and increment towards an appropriate 'product').",Guerra R.; Smith K.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2016-11-28,College of Engineering;American Society for Engineering Education;University of Minnesota Twin Cities,Entrepreneurship ;  Innovation ;  Research impact
Theory-based course design for professional master's degree program in business engineering,"The shortage of young engineers presents a structural problem that deflates growth and innovation and causes high value losses for the economy. To achieve sustainable success in securing new recruits, prospective students from working life are highly relevant for the universities, because they act at the crossroads of Engineering and Business. Although the offer of studying programs alongside work has grown in recent years in Germany, there is still a lack of theory-based development in didactic concepts for this specific studying group. Generally, there is still a need for research in context of accompanied studies and student-centered contact with the learning professionals. This paper aims to generate new insights in a threefold way: (1) by specifying challenges and approaches for accompanied studying programs in Business Engineering; (2) by explaining the theoretical framework for the methodical educational arrangement of exemplary engineering courses; and (3) by describing first experiences with the concept during the development and implementation in selected engineering courses. This generates empirically grounded knowledge on the theory-based course design for learning professionals and contributes the translation of pedagogical research to practice.",Block B.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2016-11-28,Leuphana Universität Lüneburg,Design-based research ;  Employed learners ;  Lifelong learning ;  Model of educational reconstruction ;  Professional master's degree in Engineering

Advances in concentrating solar thermal research and technology,"After decades of research and development, concentrating solar thermal (CST) power plants (also known as concentrating solar power (CSP) and as Solar Thermal Electricity or STE systems) are now starting to be widely commercialized. Indeed, the IEA predicts that by 2050, with sufficient support over ten percent of global electricity could be produced by concentrating solar thermal power plants. However, CSP plants are just but one of the many possible applications of CST systems. Advances in Concentrating Solar Thermal Research and Technology provides detailed information on the latest advances in CST systems research and technology. It promotes a deep understanding of the challenges the different CST technologies are confronted with, of the research that is taking place worldwide to address those challenges, and of the impact that the innovation that this research is fostering could have on the emergence of new CST components and concepts. It is anticipated that these developments will substantially increase the cost-competiveness of commercial CST solutions and reshape the technological landscape of both CST technologies and the CST industry. After an introductory chapter, the next three parts of the book focus on key CST plant components, from mirrors and receivers to thermal storage. The final two parts of the book address operation and control and innovative CST system concepts. Contains authoritative reviews of CST research taking place around the world. Discusses the impact this research is fostering on the emergence of new CST components and concepts that will substantially increase the cost-competitiveness of CST power.

The AYO! project for air quality monitoring,"The school dropout is a not negligible phenomenon that, if not effectively contrasted, puts at risk the future of young people and expose them to greater risks of unemployement, poverty and social exclusion compared to peers with a good instruction level. In this paper we present AYO!, an extracurricolar laboratory aimed to contrast the high school dropout. AYO! is an acronym that means Assemble Your Objects, and it was choosen, in addition to literal meaning, for the assonance with the dialectal Sardinian's expression Ajo!, which is an exhortation that can be translated into english in 'come on!' or 'get a move on!'. AYO! allows engagement of students in design, realization and use of sensors and actuators systems with the aim of monitoring and analyzing the ambient around them. The practical activities have allowed to provide knowledge about very interesting topics for labour market and to develop awareness of how technological innovation can be used to understand the phenomena that surround them (eg. pollution, energy consumption, etc.). Specifically, the laboratory focuses on the paradigm of the Internet of Things which constitutes a key topic from the point of view of today scientific research and business strategies.",Contini M.; Orru G.; Sini A.; Sole M.; Giusto D.,Conference Proceeding,ISSE 2016 - 2016 International Symposium on Systems Engineering - Proceedings Papers,2016-11-22,Università degli Studi di Cagliari,
To the problems of engineering education in modern Russia,"The situation in the engineering education in the Russian regions is estimated as stagnation (with some recovery and development in megacities) and a prolonged adaptation of the post-Soviet realities. This situation is fueled by a number of adverse factors, including: lack of a national strategy for the development of engineering education in modern conditions; significant differences in the level of development of regions; a low level of R & D (Research and Development) needs and innovation in small and medium business in the regions.

Engineering innovation through rhetorical invention,"Teaching engineering students to innovate-to develop novel solutions, new applications, or original designs for solving problems-is becoming a more central concern in engineering education. Many programs are increasing the number of project-based courses, to provide students with the conditions in which innovation might occur, yet innovation remains difficult to teach directly. In one such course in Chemical Engineering, we introduced a framework to aid students in exploring the central questions of their projects, from how to define the problem, to how to recognize the value of previous approaches to specific technical challenges, to how to interpret the results of innovative research. This framework, which we call a 'What-How-Why' diagram, integrates the thinking that chemical engineers need to cover as they design the work of a project, with the thinking that they need to do in order to communicate that work to an audience. We have found that this framework helps students to plan their work, to recognize potential areas for specific innovation, to better recognize the significance of variations in research design, and to communicate innovative solutions more effectively.",Lane S.; Karatsolis A.,Conference Proceeding,IEEE International Professional Communication Conference,2016-11-09,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Communication pedagogy ;  engineering communication ;  innovation ;  Rhetorical invention

The Prepared Mind,"Every day, in clinics and hospitals around the world, occupational therapists care for patients with serious problems requiring viable solutions. Each patient is unique, and his or her problem does not necessarily correspond to existing practice models. Practitioners must adapt standard approaches to provide effective outcomes, yet problems exist for which few or no beneficial approaches have been identified. Such clinical issues require solutions to be generated de novo from the practitioner's body of knowledge and past experience. Yet, no single new intervention can be used without prior validation of its efficacy. Only a therapist with a prepared mind can accept such challenges, recognize what is known and not yet known, design studies to acquire that needed knowledge, and translate it into successful clinical treatment strategies. The occupational therapist with a prepared mind is one willing to seize unexpected opportunities and construct new paradigms of practice.

Reevaluation of potential and exploration effectiveness of oil bearing structures in the east part of Pearl River Mouth Basin,"Since more than 30 years of exploration, a series of large and medium-sized oil fields have been discovered in the east part of Pearl River Mouth Basin, and a number of hardly exploited oil bearing structures are also left. These structures have two main characteristics: (1) reserves scale is relatively small or unconfirmed, and thus commercial exploitation cannot be achieved; (2) The poor reservoir physical property or low quality of crude oil leads to an uneconomical productivity. With the aid of thought innovation and technical research, a set of new ideas of “2+N” linked evaluations for oil bearing structures have been formed, i.e., interconnection between two kinds of exploration concepts and multiple key technologies for the implementation of interactive three-dimensional evaluations. Guided by the exploration ideas of complex oil and gas reservoir, the favorable oil bearing structures are optimally selected based on the comprehensive research of hydrocarbon accumulation. Based on 3D seismic data acquisition or reprocessing, structural form and scale are confirmed using fine velocity analysis and time-depth conversion method; reservoir distribution is described comprehensively by seismic inversion and multiple geophysical means; as for the blind zones of logging interpretation, it is required to reexamine old wells, perform comparative analyses on adjacent wells, and correct logging interpretation parameters based on actual data, thus identifying new oil reservoirs; Through independently developing and applying advanced logging and test technologies, oil reservoirs are confirmed and productivity is also activated. In addition, the integration of exploration, development and engineering is deeply implemented to ultimately achieve, the commercial development of oil bearing structures. Using this set of ideas, Enping18-1, Lufeng15-1, Xijiang23-1 and other oil bearing structures are successfully evaluated to upgrade the reserves scale, thus promoting the process of exploration and development in the east part of Pearl River Mouth Basin and producing great economic and social benefits.",He M.; Liu L.; Zhang X.; Quan Z.; Feng J.,Journal,Shiyou Xuebao/Acta Petrolei Sinica,2016-11-01,China National Offshore Oil Corporation,Economic minability ;  Low resistivity reservoir ;  Oil bearing structure ;  Pearl River Mouth Basin ;  Test technology ;  Velocity analysis
Effect of internal capabilities on success of construction company innovation and technology transfer,"Increasing competition triggered innovation and technology transfer to be the key drivers of success for companies. In this study, a construction company’s success was indicated by its innovation and technology transfer performance defined with factors such as ""perceived value"", ""project time and budget"", ""competitive advantage"", ""reputation"", ""productivity"", ""finance"", ""learning and development"" and ""customer satisfaction"". Then, it was aimed to measure the effect of internal capabilities of a company such as ""resources and capabilities"", ""project management competencies"", and ""strategic decisions"" on success. In this context, Structural Equation Modelling method was used to analyse data collected from 52 construction companies and construct a model representing the interrelationships between the factors. According to the resulting model, it was found out that ""project management competencies"" have a direct relationship with ""company innovation and technology transfer success"" whereas, ""Resources and Capabilities"" and ""Strategic Decisions"" have both an indirect relationship with success through ""project management competencies"".",Demirdöğen G.; Işık Z.,Journal,Tehnicki Vjesnik,2016-11-01,Yıldız Teknik Üniversitesi,Construction industry ;  Innovation ;  Project management competencies ;  Resources and capabilities ;  SEM ;  Strategic decisions ;  Technology transfer
Construction and evaluation of modern agricultural processing industrial upgrading model,"China's agricultural product processing industry is changing from be driven by factors to by innovation, and the scientific and technological innovation is as the core to build industrial upgrading pattern, and then introduces the capital to enter and guide the development of the industry, which is of great significance. In this paper we analyze the factors of the agricultural product processing industry, and put forward four kinds of innovations, which are technological innovation, industrial innovation, market innovation and management innovation. Four systems, i.e. the scientific and technological innovation system, the industrial innovation system, the market innovation system and the management innovation system are constructed, and the theory, tools and methods of systematology with the coupling form of the systems are adopted, which lay a methodology foundation for constructing the upgrade mode of the modern agricultural product processing industry. According to the principles of science, practicality and simplicity, the weights of these indices were reckoned by the comparison matrix of analytic hierarchy process built in the software of MATLAB 7.6. Partial classification criteria of evaluation index system were built by the combined method of qualitative analysis and quantitative calculation. By using the method of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, the whole staffs of 15 people, who were industry experts and scholars, government regulators, and technical and managerial personnel from agricultural product processing enterprise, evaluated the agricultural product processing pattern implementation degree. Shandong Surabaya Crystal Starch Products Co., Ltd. in Sishui County, Shandong Province, China, was chosen for a case study. The enterprise was founded in 2000. The main product of the enterprise is traditional sweet potato starch, starch sheet, and so on. Due to the problems of traditional sweet potato processing industry, the company is facing the development bottleneck. In recent years, the company and the universities, scientific research institutes have established an integrated model of science and technology cooperation, and the direction of products focuses on the healthy consumption market, the construction of sweet potato whole industry chain development planning, the phased development key technology and the realization of the industrialization. At the same time, the enterprise establishes a modern enterprise management system with a clear property right, and connects the company with capital markets, expands the financing channels, and establishes the specialized marketing system, which obtain the good results. A system of comprehensive evaluation index system for the modern agricultural products processing model was established, which consists of 4 criteria layers and 19 indices. The empirical analysis showed that the Shandong Surabaya Crystal Starch Products Co., Ltd. had a comprehensive evaluation score of 2.9058, which indicated that the model was in the medium level, and the evaluation result was consistent with the real production. The following respects should be paid more attention: Production-teaching-research combination method of cooperation needs to be more in-depth and detailed; Enterprise needs to be transformed and upgraded, and at the same time, there exists the shortage of the human resources and the technology and management talent, and hence the requirement for the upgrading and the shortage of the resource do not match; Low carbon technology application still needs the policies to guide and support, and to define the new product's contribution to the total needs to effectively combine the actual production with the company market development ability; Company marketing ability still needs to strengthen, and the cultivation of team innovation spirit and innovative culture remains to be improved. The system of clear property right of modern enterprise management should be improved to attract capital to stimulate enterprise to enter a stage of rapid development. Through the evaluation, the relative advantages and disadvantages existing in the development of agricultural product processing enterprises can be found. The study not only has a high reference value for the transformation and upgrading of traditional agricultural processing industry, but also provides a theoretical support for the research of modern agricultural industry mode.",Sun J.; Wang M.; Pei H.; Chen Z.; Yang Y.,Journal,Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering,2016-11-01,Chinese Academy of Agricultural Engineering,Agricultural products ;  Comprehensive evaluation ;  Four innovations ;  Industrial upgrading ;  Models ;  Processing
Technology Catch-up with Chinese Characteristics: What Can Southeast Asia Learn from China?,"China’s technological progress is as spectacular as the growth of its economy since 1978. Technology indicators place China just behind the United States, which has a much higher per capita income. China’s progress is material to Southeast Asia because its per capita income, being similar to that of the Association of South East Asian Nation’s, will have considerable relevance for this region; and China’s technological advance will probably intensify competition between its products and Southeast Asian exports. Yet China possesses features that are arguably unique, the most important being its size and the role of the state. The strategies discussed here—technology alliances with foreign firms, learning by exporting through participation in global supply chains, indigenous innovation aided by the state’s heavy hand, forward engineering through institutionalized commercialization of university- and research institute-based research and development, technology acquisition through mergers and acquisitions, and cost innovation through novel methods of cutting costs—all leverage China’s specific characteristics. Even without these characteristics, Southeast Asian countries, early in the catch-up process, can emulate China’s initial strategies such as technology outsourcing. For more developed Southeast Asia, China’s methods to strengthen technological capacity are important lessons.",Cheong K.; Wong C.; Goh K.,Journal,Round Table,2016-11-01,Universiti Malaya,catch-up ;  cost innovation ;  indigenous innovation ;  mergers and acquisitions ;  outsourcing ;  technology
TRIZ: Engineering Methodologies to Improve the Process Reliability,"Research of solutions to problem in existing processes often deals with the tendency to follow mental schemes because of the psychological inertia. This study illustrates a knowledge-based systematic methodology of inventive problem solving for the effective development of new systems and solutions, a theory that consists of theoretical foundation, analytical and knowledge-based tools, applicable in conjunction with other creativity and engineering methodologies. The TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solution) applicability in process reliability can develop new and effective solutions thanks to the examination of contradiction, different prospective, and points of view. The systematic innovation process provides a platform to integrate heterogeneous resources and tools opening the problem-solving methodology to new and different interdisciplinary approaches. The deconstruction and identification of issues to analyze the problems in their context and in relation to other factors are adopted in many areas of industrial production as well as in the more general problem-solving matters. In particular, this study will show how TRIZ can be used in process optimization rather than research and development where this methodology is commonly adopted. This case represents a practical application of the TRIZ to increase quality and reliability in regard to a manufacturing process of an industry that designs and builds molds and equipment for the production of aluminum food containers.

From laboratory to industrial scale: a scale-up framework for chemical processes in life cycle assessment studies,"Life cycle assessments (LCA) of an early research state reaction process only have laboratory experiments data available. While this is helpful in understanding the laboratory process from an environmental perspective, it gives only limited indication on the possible environmental impact of that same material or process at industrial production. Therefore, a comparative LCA study with materials that are already produced at industrial scales is not very meaningful. The scale-up of chemical processes is not such a trivial process and requires a certain understanding of the involved steps. In this paper, we elaborated a framework that helps to scale up chemical production processes for LCA studies when only data from laboratory experiments are available. Focusing on heated liquid phase batch reactions, we identified and simplified the most important calculations for the reaction step's energy use as well as for certain purification and isolation steps. For other LCA in- and output values, we provide estimations and important qualitative considerations to be able to perform such a scale-up study. Being an engineering-based approach mainly, it does not include systematically collected empirical data which would give a better picture about the uncertainty. However, it is a first approach to predict the environmental impact for certain chemical processes at an industrial production already during early laboratory research stage. It is designed to be used by LCA practitioners with limited knowledge in the field of chemistry or chemical engineering and help to perform such a scale-up based on a logical and systematic procedure.",Piccinno F.; Hischier R.; Seeger S.; Som C.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2016-11-01,Empa - Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology;Universität Zürich,Life cycle assessment ;  Prospective LCA ;  Scale-up ;  Sustainable chemistry ;  Sustainable innovation
University–industry collaboration and firms’ R&D effort,"This paper investigates the impact of publicly funded university–industry collaboration on UK firms’ R&D effort. We test the hypotheses that project participation has a positive effect on firms’ R&D expenditure per employee and on their share of R&D employment. The paper exploits a novel source of data made up of a set of U–I projects funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council between 1997 and 2007 and firm-level data available through the UK Office for National Statistics. We employ propensity score matching to select an appropriate control group of untreated firms on the basis of the probability that they participate to U–I partnerships. We then estimate the impact of participation on firms’ R&D effort in two points in time via ordinary least squares regression. The results show a positive and significant impact on the share of R&D employment two years after the end of projects. This is also confirmed by a robustness check. A positive effect on R&D expenditure per employee is found both at the end of the project and two years later. These findings are highly relevant for policy, given that U–I collaboration is among the most frequent policy instruments put in place by local and national policy-makers to foster pre-competitive research and firms’ R&D activities.",Scandura A.,Journal,Research Policy,2016-11-01,Università degli Studi di Torino,Propensity score matching ;  R&D employment ;  R&D expenditure ;  University–industry collaboration
The sciences are different and the differences matter,"While biology often has been identified as the field of science where over the past half century progress has been most dramatic, physics continues to be the widely held model of what a field of science should aim to be like. The ideal hallmarks are quantitative characterization of the subject matter studied and mathematical specification of theory. The central argument of this paper is that the subject matter of many important fields of science is very different from that of physics – several of the physical sciences and much of biology, as well as the social sciences, are good examples – and that trying to ape the descriptive and analytic characteristics of physics in these fields hinders the development of understanding.

A creative idea generation methodology by future envisioning from the user experience perspective,"Although several studies have suggested activities of the fuzzy front end (FFE), they focus more on incremental innovation than to radical innovation. This study developed a creative idea generation methodology for the FFE of radical innovation from the user experience (UX) perspective, i.e., UX-driven idea generation methodology. Based on a literature review, a creative idea generation process was developed; it consists of four successive phases (Future envision, Opportunity identification and analysis, Idea generation, and Idea expansion) and one supportive phase (Ideation control). From various research fields, 70 idea generation techniques were collected and classified into phases of the process. To identify implicit and latent opportunities, the future envision method was developed based on a factor combination approach. In assessments by four experts in IT, the ideas generated by the UX-driven idea generation methodology got higher scores than brainstorming approach in novelty and relevance, but not in feasibility. The effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction was greater in the group who used the UX-driven idea generation methodology. Relevance to industry: The idea generation methodology suggested in this study can help indusial designers such as novice designers, analytical individuals as well as intuitive individuals who adhere to initial ideas. The UX-driven methodology can be used as a guideline when selecting an idea generation technique in the FFE.",Moon H.; Han S.,Journal,International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics,2016-11-01,Pohang University of Science and Technology,Creative problem solving ;  Design fixation ;  Fuzzy front end ;  Idea generation technique ;  Scenario

The Evolution of the Platform Concept: A Systematic Review,"Platforms have been considered as a paradigm for managing new product development and innovation. Since their introduction, studies on platforms have introduced multiple conceptualizations, leading to a fragmentation of research and different perspectives. By systematically reviewing the platform literature and combining bibliometric and content analyses, this paper examines the platform concept and its evolution, proposes a thematic classification, and highlights emerging trends in the literature. Based on this hybrid methodological approach (bibliometric and content analyses), the results show that platform research has primarily focused on issues that are mainly related to firms' internal aspects, such as innovation, modularity, commonality, and mass customization. Moreover, scholars have recently started to focus on new research themes, including managerial questions related to capability building, strategy, and ecosystem building based on platforms. As its main contributions, this paper improves the understanding of and clarifies the evolutionary trajectory of the platform concept, and identifies trends and emerging themes to be addressed in future studies.",Facin A.; De Vasconcelos Gomes L.; De Mesquita Spinola M.; Salerno M.,Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2016-11-01,Universidade de São Paulo,Innovation ;  platforms ;  product development ;  systematic review ;  technological strategy
Managing the transition to the new agile business and product development model: Lessons from Cisco Systems,"Through an in-depth case study of Cisco Systems, this Executive Digest finds that companies face two broad challenges when transitioning to the agile product development model. The first is identifying and helping business units and engineering teams adopt this method; the second is developing new management practices that are compatible with and can sustain the agile development practices. Although extant literature has conducted many analyses on these two challenges, there still exist gaps in the research of the agile development method. Herein, we explore how Cisco Systems addressed these two challenges followed by a discussion of the broad implications of adopting the agile development method.

Social innovation research: An emerging area of innovation studies?,"While the adoption of Social Innovation (SI) in the governance and policy domain has fueled a rapidly expanding scholarly literature, this field has become characterized by conceptual ambiguity and a diversity of definitions and research settings. This present situation inhibits the integration of findings. This paper traces the content, scope and relatively short history of modern social innovation research across disciplines by applying network and bibliometric analyses, and explores their relevance to innovation studies. Based on data from 172 publications, we analyze scholarly works that directly address the social innovation topic, allowing us to identify the precedence, dynamics and the current map of social innovation research as an emerging field of study. Our analysis suggests that the SI field is grounded in four distinct intellectual communities arising through a somewhat organized diffusion process: 1) Community Psychology; 2) Creativity research; 3) Social and societal challenges; 4) Local development. The interest of SI in the areas of management and entrepreneurship is only very recent and is currently reflected within existing communities. We forge conceptual bridges between the two (currently very separate) domains of social innovation and innovation studies, and the implications of our finding for further research and policy are also discussed.",van der Have R.; Rubalcaba L.,Journal,Research Policy,2016-11-01,"The World Bank, USA;Aalto University;Teknologian Tutkimuskeskus VTT;Universidad de Alcalá",Bibliometrics ;  Integrative literature review ;  Social entrepreneurship ;  Social innovation ;  Social technology ;  Social value
The triple layered business model canvas: A tool to design more sustainable business models,"The Triple Layered Business Model Canvas is a tool for exploring sustainability-oriented business model innovation. It extends the original business model canvas by adding two layers: an environmental layer based on a lifecycle perspective and a social layer based on a stakeholder perspective. When taken together, the three layers of the business model make more explicit how an organization generates multiple types of value – economic, environmental and social. Visually representing a business model through this canvas tool supports developing and communicating a more holistic and integrated view of a business model; which also supports creatively innovating towards more sustainable business models. This paper presents the triple layer business model canvas tool and describes its key features through a re-analysis of the Nestlé Nespresso business model. This new tool contributes to sustainable business model research by providing a design tool which structures sustainability issues in business model innovation. Also, it creates two new dynamics for analysis: horizontal coherence and vertical coherence.",Joyce A.; Paquin R.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2016-11-01,John Molson School of Business;INSTITUT DE DÉVELOPPEMENT DE PRODUITS,Business model innovation ;  Business models for sustainability ;  Sustainable business models ;  Triple bottom line ;  Triple layered business model canvas
Grenoble–GIANT Territorial Innovation Models: Are investments in research infrastructures worthwhile?,"Over the past decades, the EU heavily invested in Research Infrastructures (RI). What are the expected returns of such investments? In the present article we address the question of returns on public funds/public infrastructures. We consider the role of RI and universities from an economic, social, and entrepreneurial perspective from various Territorial Innovation Models (TIMs): (1) Italian industrial districts, (2) innovative milieus, (3) regional innovation systems, (4) new industrial spaces, and (5) regional clusters. We conducted our empirical study on Grenoble Isère Alpes Nanotechnologies (GIANT), which is composed of large scientific instruments, universities, and engineering and management schools. Our microeconomic methodology measured the socioeconomic and entrepreneurial effects of GIANT with respect to budget, employment, and spin-off generation. We contribute to the existing body of knowledge on TIMs by (1) comparing the long-term investments to the generation of wealth, the creation of employment, and the development of start-ups; (2) adding new insights to the debate opposing positive and negative impacts empirical studies; and (3) offering recommendations for the use of public resources. In our discussion, we compare the GIANT model as a very localized RI-university club to the Grenoble model as localized cluster.",Scaringella L.; Chanaron J.,Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2016-11-01,Rennes School of Business;Grenoble Ecole de Management;CNRS Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique,Research infrastructure ;  Return on investment ;  Socioeconomic impact ;  Start-up ;  Territorial Innovation Models ;  University
Critical factors for transforming creativity into sustainability,"Although creativity and sustainability have received considerable attention in the literature, there is limited research considering both – particularly in relation to co-existing organizational factors which facilitate the transformation of creativity into sustainable products. This paper explores this gap through an analysis of six case studies of commercial organizations presenting both successful and unsuccessful implementation of sustainable products/services, across types of firms and industries. The research framework focuses on three general facets: 1) leadership; 2) boundaries, where different aspects of internal and external firm's activities enable a diversity of opinions and stakeholder engagement; and 3) economic alignment/instrumentality, in which the goal of wealth creation is present and supported by a firm's capabilities. The main finding of the paper is that appropriate leadership along with effective boundary spanning and clear profit orientation are simultaneously necessary conditions for successful transformation of creative business ideas into successful sustainable products/services by business organizations. This implies a steep discounting of success prospects if any of the above factors is lacking. The work contributes to the development of general theoretical frameworks and approaches for achieving organizational success based on co-creating social and economic value at the same time.",Przychodzen W.; Przychodzen J.; Lerner D.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2016-11-01,"Laureate Education, Inc.;Universidad de Deusto;Universidad del Desarrollo",Boundary spanning ;  Case study ;  Creativity ;  Leadership ;  Sustainable development ;  Sustainable innovation
A DSS-Based Framework for Enhancing Collaborative Web-Based Operations Management in Manufacturing SME Supply Chains,"The precision engineering sector lies at the heart of the UK’s manufacturing capability. Companies that operate in this sector support major economy-driving industries such as aerospace, defence, motorsport, nuclear, off-highway equipment, oil and gas, and renewable energy. The main companies that constitute this sector are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Successful precision engineering businesses are required to master process innovation and supply chain solutions, and in these types of business, the implementation of innovative, collaborative solutions has become a necessary strategy for enhancing SME decision-making capability as well as for improving overall business competitiveness. The aim of the research described in this paper is to present how, by mentoring and supporting SME organisations through on-line based collaboration, it is possible to engage in improved collaborative alliances and how precision-engineering SMEs can benefit and are able to enhance their performance. The research is supported by a description of a case study undertaken in a precision engineering SME, from the UK northwest region, in order to demonstrate the application of the collaborative decision support systems approach.",Hernández J.; Lyons A.; Stamatopoulos K.,Journal,Group Decision and Negotiation,2016-11-01,University of Liverpool Management School;Universidad de la Frontera;AMF Precision Engineering Ltd,Collaborative operations management ;  Supply chain integration ;  Web-based decision support system
Towards a new paradigm: Activity level balanced sustainability reporting,"Technoeconomic paradigms based economic growth theories suggest that waves of technological innovations drove the economic growth of advanced economies. Widespread economic degradation and pollution is an unintended consequence of such growth. Tackling environmental and social issues at firm levels would help us to overcome such issues at macro-levels. Consequently, the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) reporting approach promotes firm level economic, environmental and social performances. Incorporating Zink's (2014) 3-pillar presentation model, this paper indicates that economic, social and environmental performances tend to be reported at firm level. All three pillars are not covered evenly at the activity levels. Thus, a loophole is identified whereby excellent environmental performance at activity levels could potentially leave poor social performance undisclosed. A refinement of the TBL paradigm, whereby all three pillars are covered at the activity level, is suggested, to enhance sustainability reporting.",Samudhram A.; Siew E.; Sinnakkannu J.; Yeow P.,Journal,Applied Ergonomics,2016-11-01,Monash University Malaysia,Global reporting initiative ;  Human factors ;  Sustainability reporting ;  Triple bottom line
Lowering the barriers for online cross-media usage: Scenarios for a Belgian single sign-on solution,"The digitization has led to an ecosystem in which an online media portal has become an essential extension of traditional media and users are enabled to consume news and entertainment via different platforms. These evolutions pose some challenges for the media companies in terms of shifting business models, but they also bring them new possibilities in managing their relations with users. An important first step here is to identify the online users and turn anonymous users into registered ones. Today, however, there is a myriad of logins and passwords one needs when surfing the web, which can make the management of these logins a challenge for users. The Belgian media industry seeks to deal with this challenge by introducing a collaborative nation-wide single sign-on (SSO) system across their digital platforms, called Media ID. This paper provides four scenarios describing the potential outcomes in terms of user adoption and hence market potential of the integration of a SSO service into a regional media system. The scenarios are built upon focus group interviews with media users and in-depth interviews with the stakeholders from the involved media companies. They describe to what extent the innovative service can influence user's online media consumption behaviour but also to what extent the media companies can implement it, two factors that mutually shape each other. In the discussion of the scenarios, requirements to ensure the broad applicability of a SSO service by both media users and media organizations are identified.",Komorowski M.; Coppens P.; Van Den Broeck W.; Braet O.,Journal,Telematics and Informatics,2016-11-01,Vrije Universiteit Brussel,Forecasting ;  Identity management ;  Media innovation ;  Qualitative user research ;  Scenario analysis ;  Single sign-on
The golden thread: educator connectivity as a central pillar in the development of creativity through childhood education. An Irish life history study,"This paper presents the narratives of five creative Irish Adults who contributed to the study by sharing their childhood education experiences. The five participants are all of different ages and occupations. All identify themselves as highly creative people and all worked with me over the course of this study to identify how this creativity developed within their engagement with the Irish childhood education system. All excelled with higher education and they share a high degree of success within their careers. Between them, they express their creativity across five key genres. These are: Science, Engineering, The Arts, Entrepreneurship and Social Entrepreneurship. Well-developed themes were analysed to identify interrelationships which formed a theoretical framework of core concepts that demonstrate what holds great importance in the lives of these participants for the development of their creativity during childhood education in Ireland. A clear theme of this study was that of connectivity. Connections and relationships matter greatly. The creative journey is joyful and clear where children experience a positive connection with their educator. Conversely, the creative journey is stymied by a lack of connection or by a negative connection. These stand in the way of creative growth, like a big boulder on the child's developmental path.

Study on the influence of environmental regulation intensity on the directed technological change under the perspective of green growth,"A nonlinear optimal control model has been constructed to address the question of how environmental regulations contribute to green growth by affecting choices of leading technology innovation. The model consists with an objective function of green growth achievement as well as constrains of growth at an equilibrium growth rate and continuous improvement of environmental quality. Drawing on the theory of optimal control and the principle of maximal value, the quantity expressions of brown technology innovation investment returns, green technology innovation investment returns, and capital allocation have been constructed. The results of the numerical simulation reveal that: although the brown capital achieves high productive elasticity, green capital is the critical support of economic growth; implementation of environmental regulations will direct investment to the green technological innovation arena, and the more intense of the regulations, the more green investment will be utilized; further green-tech innovation will facilitate more achievements of green growth.",Zhou J.; Wu C.; Xiao G.,Journal,Xitong Gongcheng Lilun yu Shijian/System Engineering Theory and Practice,2016-10-25,Dalian University of Technology,Brown technological change ;  Environmental regulation intensity ;  Green growth ;  Green technological change
"Social capital, technology innovation and the turning-point of resource curse","Set social capital and technology innovation endogenous, we construct a four-sector endogenous economic growth model, by which we analyze the mechanism how social capital and technology innovation promote economic growth. We conclude that social capital accelerates self-accumulation, leading more labor flow into the technology innovation department, encouraging technology innovation, weakening the crowding-out effect on technology innovation resulting from resource development, cutting off the pathway of the resource curse, fundamentally social capital become the key to break the resource curse. Further, constructing social capital index with government agencies quality and information communication and sharing, using Chinese provincial panel data between 1998-2013, we find that: 1) social capital has positive effect on technology innovation and economic growth; 2) with the cross-effect of social capital and technology innovation introduced, the turning point of inverted U curve of resource and economy gradually goes back, confirming the existence of endogenous mechanism that social capital helps to break the resource curse.",Wan J.; Meig U.,Journal,Xitong Gongcheng Lilun yu Shijian/System Engineering Theory and Practice,2016-10-25,Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics;Jiangxi Normal University;Academy of Mathematics and System Sciences Chinese Academy of Sciences,Inverted U curve ;  Resource curse ;  Social capital ;  Technology innovation

Given the increasingly profound connection between innovation, science, and mathematical sciences, it is natural to inquire whether the interface between these three activities is functioning in an optimal way via STEM teachings and researches. We believe that these STEM teachings and researches are somewhat strengthened and essentially driven by industrial mathematics. However, due to the nature of industrial mathematics as an enabling technology for the new industry, its contribution is rarely visible in the final product that industry delivers. This paper will present the current scenario of this interface in Malaysia and to suggest mechanisms for intensifying the connection between industrial mathematics and industry. In particular we explore the degree of rapport between academia and industry, the contemporary trends in teachings and researches in the industrial mathematics, and to share the world wide experiences of the mutually beneficial relationship between industrial mathematicians and related STEM researchers in academia and industry. The paper will showcase the specific problem solving in collaboration with academics and industry practitioners during the Malaysian MISG 2011, 2014 and 2015.",Aziz Z.; Bahar A.,Conference Proceeding,AIP Conference Proceedings,2016-10-24,Universiti Teknologi Malaysia;Institute Ibnu Sina for Scientific and Industrial Research,

Parallel evaluation of a DSP algorithm using Julia,Rapid pace of innovation in industrial research labs requires fast algorithm evaluation cycles. The use of multi-core hardware and distributed clusters is essential to achieve reasonable turnaround times for high-load simulations. Julia's support for these as well as its pervasive multiple dispatch make it very attractive for high-performance technical computing. Our experiments in speeding up a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Intellectual Property (IP) model simulation for a Wireless LAN (WLAN) product confirm this. We augment standard SystemC High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tool-flow by an interactive worksheet supporting performance visualization and rapid design space exploration cycles.,Kourzanov P.,Conference Proceeding,"SEPS 2016 - Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Software Engineering for Parallel Systems, co-located with SPLASH 2016",2016-10-21,Delft University of Technology,HLS ;  Julia ;  LSF ;  MapReduce ;  SystemC
The Götheborg IV model: Addressing the Cartesian continuum in product-service innovation,"In recognition of an existing Cartesian perspective in practice and research of product and service as two distinct entities in product-centric MNEs, an integral perspective of the product-service innovation processes is introduced in the form of the Götheborg IV (G4) model. Based on the assumption that the core activity of any enterprise is exchange, where the value of production is realized in its exchange, the G4 model is an applied linguistics perspective of the Uppsala model (UM) of internationalization/globalization. Key in the G4 model of product-service innovation is the visualization of the emergent, cyclic dialogic of the feedback loop as having an important role in the context of uncertainty and complexity in product-service innovation.",Cordeiro C.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 IEEE International Conference on Management of Innovation and Technology, ICMIT 2016",2016-10-20,"Handelshögskolan;ABB Corporate Research, Vasteras",Götheborg IV model ;  internationalization processes ;  product-service innovation ;  Uppsala model

Conceptual model for open innovation towards knowledge sharing in Indonesian SME,"Technological enhancement requires every enterprise within a big scale as well as the medium and small one, to act on developmental initiatives through innovation. This very idea urges business executors to conduct an innovation, mainly for the medium scale to be able to compete with the big one. In dealing with obstacles, the owner of Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) must be able to innovate in order to elevate competitiveness. The innovation process being done evidently cannot be separated from human resource within the organization. The innovation process within an organization will require new knowledge, therefore knowledge sharing between individuals inside the organization and between involving stakeholders will be needed. Knowledge sharing is vital as one of the main components in open innovation process. This notion shows that knowledge sharing needs to be well-managed so that SME can perform open innovation process optimally. Current business competition demands SME to perform an innovation which involves all-existing stakeholders in order to increase its potential from the aspect of economy, social, as well as culture. The output of this research is a model construction in which two endogenous constructs i.e. knowledge sharing and open innovation are synthesized. The exogenous constructs for knowledge sharing include communication and interaction, learning, culture of the environment, relationship, motivation, nature of knowledge, and opportunity of share. While for open innovation, the exogenous constructs consist of organization system, market demand/need, networking, stakeholders, innovation capability, type of technology, and human resource readiness.",Rumanti A.; Samadhi T.; Wiratmadja I.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 IEEE International Conference on Management of Innovation and Technology, ICMIT 2016",2016-10-20,Institut Teknologi Bandung,Knowledge Sharing ;  Open Innovation ;  SME
Organizational innovation based on intellectual capital and transfer tacit knowledge,"Today, with the growth of technology, all types of business are required to expand. This encouraged the business owners to innovate, especially the mid-scale enterprises, in order to compete with large-scale competitors. To overcome various obstacles, the owners of SMEs must be able to innovate to raise competitiveness. The innovation process cannot be separated from the human factor in the organization. The process of innovation in organizations requires new knowledge that takes a knowledge transfer between individuals within the organization. The preferred type of knowledge transfer in the innovation process is the transfer of tacit knowledge because it cannot be learned through guidance, but solely through the experiences of each individual. The transfer of tacit knowledge for each individual within an organization must not be separated from intellectual capital, which when be found and leveraged, will give a new resource to compete and win. This is what triggers the need for the transfer of tacit knowledge towards intellectual capital in the innovation process. The object of this research is SME Batik Tulis Kebon Indah, Yogyakarta. The reason for this particular selection is due to its fairly high competition in regards with economic growth. To face such level of competition, SME Batik Tulis Kebon Indah must be able to innovate yet still maintaining its trademark in order to compete with other similar SME. Data processing method used in this research is Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with the Partial Least Square (PLS). Result from this research shows that there is effect of the tacit knowledge transfer among individuals within the SME towards intellectual capital in innovation process.",Rumanti A.; Hidayat T.; Reynaldo R.; Stephanie.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 IEEE International Conference on Management of Innovation and Technology, ICMIT 2016",2016-10-20,Universitas Katolik Indonesia Atma Jaya;Institut Teknologi Bandung,Innovation Organization ;  Intellectual Capital ;  Transfer Tacit Knowledge
A systematic meta-analysis on managing innovation projects in uncertain and complex environments,"With the prevalence of global project-focused organisations, project management is emerging as a vital conduit of innovation within such companies. This study aims to provide a detailed meta-analytic insight into contemporary project management trends, with a particular focus on complexity of innovative projects. Trends in project management literature were analysed from 1975 to 2015. Findings from the analysis highlight the importance of strategic alignment, agility, competencies development and risk management for successful project implementation. By exploring inherent dynamics enabling/constraining practitioners to deliver projects successfully in complex, uncertain environments helps reveal factors influencing their ability to collaborate and realise innovative potential. The analysis also highlights a lack of standardisation in project management practices, which hinders the effective dealing with innovative complexity. Overall the study contributes to further our understanding of managing complex projects.",Michaelides R.; Bryde D.; Simango J.; Unterhitzenberger C.; Argyropoulou M.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 IEEE International Conference on Management of Innovation and Technology, ICMIT 2016",2016-10-20,University of Liverpool Management School;Liverpool John Moores University,Complexity ;  innovation capabilities ;  uncertainty
Frugal innovation in e-commerce: A case study of Taobao,"The emerging markets are experiencing high growths, have massive and still expanding market sizes, and huge labor forces, but they also face significant constraints such as resource constraints, immature infrastructures, and low purchasing power. The internal gap between huge unsatisfied demands for low-cost products from the bottom of the pyramid and the weak economic foundation in emerging markets has given rise to a new innovation paradigm-frugal innovation. Since many prior studies have looked at frugal innovation in products, our study rather focuses on frugal innovation of e-commerce platform from the perspective of value chain. We choose the case of e-commerce enterprise in China and research platform service provided by Taobao.",Liu X.; Lin Y.; Zhang S.; Xie Y.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 IEEE International Conference on Management of Innovation and Technology, ICMIT 2016",2016-10-20,Xiamen University;Shepherd University,E-commerce ;  frugal innovation ;  Taobao
Connectivity in the technology transfer process among local ASEAN firms,"This study investigates the mediating role of human factors in absorbing externally available information into product innovations of firms in four Southeast Asian countries. This absorption process consists of two sub-processes, namely the acquisition process from which outside information is employed to the firm's innovative capacity and the transformation process in which innovative capacity creates innovation. This study attempts to identify human elements essential to indigenous innovative capacity building. As such elements may help the absorption process, this study focused on personnel with experience of working with multinational enterprises (MNEs) and indigenous employees of the firm. As for the transforming capability, organizational learning process, including quality control (QC) and cross-functional teams are examined. The analysis indicates that MNEs have the largest impact as external linkages and for the connectivity with external linkages such as MNEs and public organizations and universities, the best mediators are top management and factory managers who have working experience with MNEs, whereas indigenous employees such as local engineers, managers, and line leaders are the best mediators for connectivity with locals.",Tsuji M.; Idota H.; Ueki Y.; Bunno T.; Shigeno H.; Machikita T.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 IEEE International Conference on Management of Innovation and Technology, ICMIT 2016",2016-10-20,Faculty of Business Administration;Kindai University;Japan External Trade Organization;Kobe International University;Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia,absorptive capacity ;  connectivity ;  human elements ;  indigenous capacity ;  organizational learning ;  SEM
The effect of intangible resources on innovation in service firms with the role of absorptive capacity as a moderating variable,"Innovation is widely recognized as one main contributor to a firm's competitiveness. To conduct innovation, an organization must utilize its tangible and intangibles resources. The current study is aimed at examining the effect of intangible resources, namely human, organizational and relational resources on innovation in the context of service firms (i.e., tutoring agencies) in Indonesia. In addition, the role of absorptive capacity as a moderating variable is also tested. Based on the survey among tutoring agencies in Indonesia, the findings show that intangible resources have a significant impact on innovation. Moreover, the absorptive capacity plays a significant role as a moderating between the relational resources and innovation. The study provides a better understanding on the existing debate and literature on a firm's resources and innovation especially within service firms.",Nanggong A.; Indarti N.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 IEEE International Conference on Management of Innovation and Technology, ICMIT 2016",2016-10-20,Universitas Gadjah Mada;Ichsan Gorontalo University,Absorptive capacity ;  intangible resources ;  service innovation
Managing knowledge management competency by integrating with collaborative behavior into improving hospitality innovation capability,"How firms utilize collaboration on managing resource-based knowledge for innovation is a crucial question for hospitality industry. The purpose of the study is to examine the impacts of knowledge transfer and technical services learning, in enhancing search and acquisition process, on innovation. A 181 stratified hotel sample in Thailand was collected. The findings strongly indicate that knowledge search and acquisition process integrating with knowledge transfer and technical learning have a positive impact on internal innovation. Having more internal capability, firms can then improve service innovation. However, knowledge transfer and technical learning do not affect service innovation. Interestingly, internal innovation does not influence performances directly, but to performances by mediating of service innovation.

The primacy of innovation in strategic financial management-understanding the impact of innovation and performance on capital structure,"This paper intends to determine the impact of pursuing a strategy for innovation on capital structure decisions and performance. It builds on the R&D management research which is country-focused and utilizes an international sample. This is significant when considering the sample of the study. While past studies have focused on single country samples, this study utilizes the most innovative firms in the world, thereby raising a new aspect in the innovation theory. Interestingly, this study finds that directionality of leverage, R&D investment and performance relationships observed appear to be contrary to existing research. This is attributed to the cross-country characteristics within the sample. This study differs from existing research by indicating variations in patterns of advertisement intensity and R&D investment across countries, as well as variations in patterns of innovation scores and business sophistication.

Enhancing agricultural mechanization level through information technology,"Since 1978, great progress has been achieved in Chinese agriculture. However, the problems still exist in the development process, such as low labor productivity, high production cost, low land productivity, low yield, low rate of resource utilization and lacking international competitiveness of agricultural products. One important reason for these problems lies in the low agricultural mechanization level in China. The informationization of agricultural machinery is a fundamental way to enhance agricultural mechanization level. In order to keep the sustained growth of agricultural mechanization level and accomplish the agricultural sustainable development in China, it is critical to take full advantages of advanced information technology to improve the design, manufacturing, operation and management of agricultural machinery, and then to enhance the level of agricultural mechanization. This paper mainly introduced: 1) The key information technologies for agricultural machinery design: parametric design, agricultural machinery product design based on knowledge engineering, and concurrent and collaborative design based on product data management; 2) The key information technologies for agricultural machinery manufacturing: flexible manufacturing, computer integrated manufacturing, and virtual and network manufacturing; 3) The key information technologies for agricultural machinery operation: agricultural information acquisition, agricultural machinery navigation, and field management; 4) The key information technologies for agricultural machinery management: agricultural machinery management, and agricultural machinery scheduling. The deficiencies of current information technologies were analyzed, the development trend was summarized for the countries all over the world, and the core issues of enhancing the agricultural mechanization level in China for present information technologies were proposed. In order to further enhance the level of agricultural mechanization by using information technology, some suggestions are proposed in this paper: 1) To make the breakthrough in key technologies of digital design of intelligent equipment, coordinated control of auto-navigation and fieldbus technology of agricultural equipment; 2) To strengthen the innovation of major precision production equipment, such as precision production equipment for field operation and facilities agriculture, orchard production and livestock, and poultry and aquaculture production; 3) To construct the precision operating system for modern agricultural machinery, and to research and develop a series of major technical products, such as precision operating system of water, fertilizer and pesticide, automatic feeding system and automated processing production line of livestock, poultry and aquaculture.",Luo X.; Liao J.; Zou X.; Zhang Z.; Zhou Z.; Zang Y.; Hu L.,Journal,Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering,2016-10-15,South China Agricultural University,Agricultural machinery ;  Agricultural mechanization ;  Agricultural sustainable development ;  Information technology ;  Modern agriculture ;  Sustainable development

Collaborative Innovation: A Model for Selecting the Optimal Ecosystem Innovation Strategy,"Traditionally, innovation initiatives in software-intensive systems companies are viewed as either internal innovation, such as technology driven innovation based on ideas generated within a company, as collaborative innovation where a number of stakeholders co-create value, or as external innovation in which companies adopt strategies to capture and expand on ideas created by other stakeholders. However, and based on longitudinal case study research in six software-intense companies in the embedded systems domain, we see that most innovation strategies involve a mix of internal, collaborative and external elements. Due to the dichotomy in approaches however, companies often fail to select the optimal innovation strategy for the specific innovation challenge at hand. As a result, innovation initiatives suffer and companies and their ecosystem partners cannot fully capitalize on the value created. In this paper, we present a conceptual framework in which we identify twelve different ecosystem-centric innovation strategies. For each strategy, we identify the internal, the collaborative and the external elements. Also, and based on our empirical findings, we provide guidelines on the optimal selection of strategies.",Olsson H.; Bosch J.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 42nd Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications, SEAA 2016",2016-10-14,Malmö Universitet;Chalmers University of Technology,Collaborative innovation ;  Innovation strategies ;  Strategy selection

Social norms of 'good' design: Interdisciplinary perspectives from a survey of engineers and clinicians in bioengineering,"In bioengineering training for new researchers and engineers, a great deal of time is spent discussing what constitutes 'good' design. Conceptualization of good design, however, varies widely across interdisciplinary team members, with potential to both foster innovation or lead to unproductive conflict. To explore how groups central to bioengineering teams (physicians/clinicians and engineers/physicists) conceptualize good design, we asked 176 professionals in bioengineering to complete a comprehensive online survey including items designed to assess cognitive and moral foundations (validated MFQ30 tool) and custom items assessing perceptions on good design in three areas (good design characteristics, reputation of design approvers, and perceived design patient/consumer suitability). Of those that responded, 82 completed all quantitative survey sections and were included in this preliminary analysis. Correlations between response areas were examined to explore the possible links between cognitive and moral biases and perspectives on good design. The survey results indicated that both groups were more conservative than average Americans based on previous reports, and clinicians scored higher on average for all MFQ30 domains. Numerous significant correlations with good design were observed among clinicians, while engineers/physicists most closely correlated good design with prescriber approval and scientific/technical literature. The exploratory analysis demonstrated the potential utility of sociological frameworks to explore relationships in design thinking with potential utility to stimulate thriving conversation on team-based design thinking in bioengineering education and practice.",Johnson A.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, EMBS",2016-10-13,GE Healthcare United States;Texas Tech University,
Managing technology licensing for stochastic R&D: from the perspective of an enterprise information system,"Enterprise information technology (IT) plays an important role in technology innovation management for high-tech enterprises. However, to date most studies on enterprise technology innovation have assumed that the research and development (R&D) outcome is certain. This assumption does not always hold in practice. Motivated by the current practice of some IT industries, we establish a three-stage duopoly game model, including the R&D stage, the licensing stage and the output stage, to investigate the influence of bargaining power and technology spillover on the optimal licensing policy for the innovating enterprise when the outcome of R&D is uncertain. Our results demonstrate that (1) if the licensor has low (high) bargaining power, fixed-fee (royalty) licensing is always superior to royalty (fixed-fee) licensing to the licensor regardless of technology spillover; (2) if the licensor has moderate bargaining power and technology spillover is low (high) as well, fixed-fee (royalty) licensing is superior to royalty (fixed-fee) licensing; (3) under two-part tariff licensing and the assumption of licensors with full bargaining power, if a negative prepaid fixed fee is not allowed, two-part tariff licensing is equivalent to royalty licensing which is the optimal licensing policy; if negative prepaid fixed fee is allowed, the optimal policy is two-part tariff licensing.",Hong X.; Zhao D.; Wang Z.,Journal,Enterprise Information Systems,2016-10-12,Henan University of Science and Technology;Huazhong Agricultural University;Huazhong University of Science and Technology,bargaining power ;  enterprise technology innovation ;  game theory ;  R&D outcome ;  technology licensing ;  technology spillover
Ethical considerations in the translation of regenerative biofabrication technologies into clinic and society,"Biofabrication technologies have the potential to improve healthcare by providing highly advanced and personalized biomedical products for research, treatment and prevention. As the combining of emerging techniques and integrating various biological and synthetic components becomes increasingly complex, it is important that relevant stakeholders anticipate the translation of biofabricated 3D tissue products into patients and society. Ethics is sometimes regarded as a brake on scientific progress, yet from our perspective, ethics in parallel with research anticipates societal impacts of emerging technologies and stimulates responsible innovation. For the ethical assessment, the biofabrication field benefits from similarities to regenerative medicine and an increasing ethical awareness in the development of tissue-engineered products. However, the novelty of the technology itself, the increase in attainable structural complexity, and the potential for automation and personalization are distinguishing facets of biofabrication that call for a specific exploration of the ethics of biofabrication. This review aims to highlight important points of existing ethical discussions, as well as to call attention to emerging issues specific to 3D biofabrication in bench and bedside research and the translation to society.",Otto I.; Breugem C.; Malda J.; Bredenoord A.,Journal,Biofabrication,2016-10-07,University Medical Center Utrecht;Universiteit Utrecht,bioethics ;  biofabrication ;  bioprinting ;  ethics ;  regenerative medicine ;  translation
Redesigning the research design: Accelerating the pace of research through technology innovation,"Clinical trials and research studies have historically been hindered by low subject participation and overall retention rates. However, recent advancements in mobile technology, Apple's HealthKit (2014) and ResearchKit (2015), have enabled smartphones to record and monitor a user's vitality signs, and volunteer that data in clinical trials or research studies. This provides an unprecedented opportunity for researchers to survey large populations of diverse individuals and recruit subjects. In the short amount of time since the introduction of ResearchKit, these applications have shown significantly higher subject recruitment rates compared to traditional methods of subject enlistment for trials. Many ResearchKit applications have been limited to surveys to capture real-world evidence, thus providing an opportunity to explore many potential technical designs, development scenarios, and engagement techniques to improve and advance an often overlooked space within healthcare.",Powell M.; To W.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 IEEE International Conference on Serious Games and Applications for Health, SeGAH 2016",2016-10-07,College of Engineering and Computer Science;IQVIA Inc.,clinical study ;  clinical trial ;  gamification ;  ResearchKit ;  subject recruitment
State-of-the-art of research advances on multi-story timber and timber-hybrid structures,"With the push for green building materials and green assembly, the application of wood in construction industry has gained more and more attention nowadays. With the increase of urban population, the industry believes that wood can't be limited to build three or less story low-rise structures.Thus North American and European countries have started research on how to build multi-story timber structures or timber-hybrid structures with other materials in the last decade. The research progress on multi-story timber and timber-hybrid structures mainly include innovation of structural system and application of new engineering wood materials, large full-scale shaking table tests and structural dynamic response, seismic performance evaluation, reliability analysis, fire resistance tests and analysis, novel design methods and case studies. The research shows that multi-story timber and timber hybrid structures have good seismic performance, fire resistance and structural reliability with reasonable structural analysis and design, and appropriate structural measures. Based on the research, Canada has allowed the construction of timber buildings up to 6 stories (18 meters high). Britain, Australia and Norway have built timber hybrid structures of 9 stories, 10 stories and 14 stories, respectively. Austria plans to build 24 stories timber hybrid structure with 75% timber by volume. Germany, Canada and America propose a construction program of 30 stories or higher timber hybrid structures.",He M.; Tao D.; Li Z.,Journal,Jianzhu Jiegou Xuebao/Journal of Building Structures,2016-10-05,Tongji University,Fire resistance ;  Multi-story timber structure ;  Reliability analysis ;  Seismic performance ;  State-of-the-art ;  Timber hybrid structure
The dhammic framework applications for understanding student behavioral usage of innovations,"The Dhammic framework is a theoretical framework that illustrates the psychological conditions of an individual from Buddhist perspectives. The Dhammic framework logically represents psychological constructs underlying how a user behaves towards a perceived system. In this article, the major psychological constructs in the Dhammic framework are experimented whether they are correlated with each others and underly student behavioural usage of innovations. Facebook was used as an experimental innovation for investigating the correlations of the Dhammic framework constructs. The experiment was conducted in similar fashion to that of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) widely recognised as a framework for measuring the user's behavioural intention towards using an innovation in order to predict the likelihood of the innovation being adopted by the user. The results show that the Dhammic framework can be used as another prominent framework for predicting user acceptance of innovations.",Jarupunphol P.,Conference Proceeding,ICCSE 2016 - 11th International Conference on Computer Science and Education,2016-10-03,Phuket Rajabhat University,Buddhism ;  Dhammic Framework ;  Facebook ;  Innovation ;  Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)
Innovation capacity and the role of information systems: a qualitative study,"Today businesses are facing radical transformations through digitalization of services and products. Accordingly, their ability to innovate is increasingly linked to the capacity to innovate through information and communication technologies (ICTs). This article investigates the role of information systems (IS) as a key factor for innovation capacity. To this end, the article discusses an interpretive framework for understanding the degree of capacity of innovation through information systems (IS) reached by a given company and the contradictions that bound its evolution. An interpretive study is also presented, where the framework has been applied to seven French companies from various industries. Consistently with the framework, the interviews address process areas and practices related to three core categories: management, innovation engineering and support. The study reveals seven fundamental contradictions that can explain the main tendencies observed across the companies.",Achi A.; Salinesi C.; Viscusi G.,Journal,Journal of Management Analytics,2016-10-01,École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne;Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne,innovation capacity ;  innovation engineering ;  innovation through information systems ;  interpretive research ;  maturity models

Augmenting corporate R&D with networked micro innovation teams,"Continuous innovation is key to a company's growth. The current models for corporate research and development are not suited for evaluating small scale emerging technology and trends. Networked micro innovation teams fill that gap and augment corporate R&D expenditure but using employee volunteers to identify and evaluate innovative concepts. These teams provide competitive advantages to the companies which develop them. The basic structure of corporate research and development has not changed despite radical changes in how ideas and technologies emerge in the market [1]. There is ample opportunity for companies to create internal innovation teams which evaluate emerging technologies and trends at a smaller scale than is practical with the traditional R&D departments. There are few studies among the legion about R&D which consider very small, or micro, innovations. Technology now enables a different approach to identifying and testing opportunities at a drastically smaller, cheaper scale than. In the past, innovative R&D departments have created autonomous islands free from bureaucracy or traditional management in order to address specific goals. Lockheed Martin's skunk work [2] and Alphabet's X lab (formerly Google[x]) are examples of innovation incubators outside the formal R&D process [3]. Creating separate laboratories which operate under separate rules can be useful pursuing auditions goals and for time and capital intensive projects, however, even these looser structures are overkill for the needs of some projects. To fill this gap, companies should create micro innovation teams which function as a network of local, decentralized teams. For example, buying an Oculus rift to explore its capabilities is an act too small for either a traditional or skunk works-style corporate R&D department. Yet, there are many opportunities for open innovation available to companies if they have the ability to conduct rapid and small-scale experimentation.",Jones K.,Journal,IEEE Engineering Management Review,2016-10-01,The George Washington University,

Specifics of elaborating methodology to teach innovative competence using embeddable module,"Introduction: the article is concerned with the development of competence when teaching students innovative activity. The analysis of bachelor's degree programmes in engineering and technology demonstrates the absence of competencies for innovation training. The curricula of the Russian universities do not contain any academic disciplines for teaching innovation as well as there is no definition of ""engineering activities"", and ""innovation"". Nethertheless the qualification requirements describe some separate components such as R&D, implementation and use of technical and technological innovations implying management of intellectual activity and its results for all occupations, hence mandatory training of bachelor degree students in innovative activities. Materials and Methods: the authors used: a) theoretical methods: analysis of philosophical, scientific, technical, engineering, psychological and educational literature; analysis and extrapolation of the research results and teaching experience; modeling of pedagogical situations, analysis of educational standards, foreign and domestic programs of technical training, textbooks and manuals; b) scientific methods: generalization, classification, ordering, compare, comparison, modeling; c) methods of special research: a system-element method, system-structural and system-functional analysis of the training content, analysis and generalization of pedagogical experience in teaching courses at universities; d) experimental and psychology diagnostic methods. Results: the authors developed and implemented the method of teaching engineering students innovative activities based on adding flexible module to core curriculum, a case study of the National Research Mordovia State University. Discussion and Conclusions: the results of the research underscore the significance of the innovation competence by including innovative training module into structure of technical disciplines, as well as specify the structure, the core part, invariable and variable parts.

A bibliometric analysis of 50 years of worldwide research on statistical process control,"An increasing number of papers on statistical process control (SPC) has emerged in the last fifty years, especially in the last fifteen years. This may be attributed to the increased global competitiveness generated by innovation and the continuous improvement of products and processes. In this sense, SPC has a fundamentally important role in quality and production systems. The research in this paper considers the context of technological improvement and innovation of products and processes to increase corporate competitiveness. There are several other statistical technics and tools for assisting continuous improvement and innovation of products and processes but, despite the limitations in their use in the improvement projects, there is growing concern about the use of SPC. A gap between the SPC technics taught in engineering courses and their practical applications to industrial problems is observed in empirical research; thus, it is important to understand what has been done and identify the trends in SPC research. The bibliometric study in this paper is proposed in this direction and uses the Web of Science (WoS) database. Data analysis indicates that there was a growth rate of more than 90% in the number of publications on SPC after 1990. Our results reveal the countries where these publications have come from, the authors with the highest number of papers and their networks. Main sources of publications are also identified; it is observed that the publications of SPC papers are concentrated in some of the international research journals, not necessarily those with the major high-impact factors. Furthermore, the papers are focused on industrial engineering, operations research and management science fields. The most common term found in the papers was cumulative sum control charts, but new topics have emerged and have been researched in the past ten years, such as multivariate methods for process monitoring and nonparametric methods.",Lizarelli F.; Bessi N.; Oprime P.; Do Amaral R.; Chakraborti S.,Journal,Gestao e Producao,2016-10-01,The University of Alabama;Universidade Federal de São Carlos,Bibliometrics ;  Cienciometrics ;  Statistical process control ;  Statistical process monitoring
Walking and health: an enactive affective system,"This essay presents a transdisciplinary project whose objective is to create a sensorised insole built with latex (Hevea brasiliensis) to measure physiological variations of the human body, as well as to graphically represent affective reciprocal exchanges of the human behaviour with the environment. The purpose is to improve our enactive system through the use of various physiological sensors (e.g. pressure, galvanic skin response and temperature sensors), which can be processed and visualised by revealing the affective exchanges of the body while walking in the city, pinned on a map as data visualisation. Inspired by the enaction theories, the output of sensors and devices application that models the perception as a laboratory phenomenon, as proposed by Dr Ted Krueger, the investigation directed by Dr Domingues is conceived for the expanded sensorium and for the reengineering of life. The artwork is inserted in the domain of aesthetic investigation of art as experiences related to topics on art and technoscience for innovation in health. The created prototype was tested in the city at different locations and the results demonstrated its use as a kind of personal assistant for vital signals by configuring an enactive system added of affective qualities which possibilities to reveal the ‘pathos’, or the affective narratives experienced in the emergent reciprocity with the city. The insole biomaterial, created by Dr Suelia Rodrigues (BioEngeLab), has been successfully used to measure the foot pressure and to serve as a health assistant, especially for people with diabetes. The signal-processing approaches, explored in Biomedical engineering by Dr Cristiano Miosso, were empowered by data visualisation approaches developed by Dr Ricardo Torres (University of Campinas).

Mitigating Climate Change at the Carbon Water Nexus: A Call to Action for the Environmental Engineering Community,"Environmental engineers have played a critical role in improving human and ecosystem health over the past several decades. These contributions have focused on providing clean water and air as well as managing waste streams and remediating polluted sites. As environmental problems have become more global in scale and more deeply entrenched in sociotechnical systems, the discipline of environmental engineering must grow to be ready to respond to the challenges of the coming decades. Here we make the case that environmental engineers should play a leadership role in the development of climate change mitigation technologies at the carbon-water nexus (CWN). Climate change, driven largely by unfettered emissions of fossil carbon into the atmosphere, is a far-reaching and enormously complex environmental risk with the potential to negatively affect food security, human health, infrastructure, and other systems. Solving this problem will require a massive mobilization of existing and innovative new technology. The environmental engineering community is uniquely positioned to do pioneering work at the CWN using a skillset that has been honed, solving related problems. The focus of this special issue, on ""The science and innovation of emerging subsurface energy technologies,"" provides one example domain within which environmental engineers and related disciplines are beginning to make important contributions at the CWN. In this article, we define the CWN and describe how environmental engineers can bring their considerable expertise to bear in this area. Then we review some of the topics that appear in this special issue, for example, mitigating the impacts of hydraulic fracturing and geologic carbon storage, and we provide perspective on emergent research directions, for example, enhanced geothermal energy, energy storage in sedimentary formations, and others.",Clarens A.; Peters C.,Journal,Environmental Engineering Science,2016-10-01,University of Virginia School of Engineering and Applied Science;School of Engineering and Applied Science,carbon water nexus ;  climate mitigation ;  emerging research directions
The Quantified Community and Neighborhood Labs: A Framework for Computational Urban Science and Civic Technology Innovation,"Instrumentation of the urban environment is not by itself sufficient to have a meaningful impact on the quality, sustainability, and resilience of cities–or more broadly on urban policy and planning. Understanding the social, economic, and cultural dynamics of urban life requires both an appreciation of the social sciences and a substantive engagement with communities across neighborhoods. The “Smart City” messaging is replete with claims of the potential for sensors and information and communication technologies (ICT) to re-shape urban life, although such rhetoric ignores the practical realities and constraints of urban decision-making and the social and distributional concerns of policy outcomes. Rather, significant progress could be achieved at the neighborhood scale by focusing diverse, intensive, and persistent real-time data collection and analysis on a “Quantified Community” (QC). The QC—a long-term neighborhood informatics research initiative—is a network of instrumented urban neighborhoods that collect, measure, and analyze data on physical and environmental conditions and human behavior to provide a rich resource to better understand how neighborhoods and the built environment affect individual and social well-being. The resulting unique experimental environment provides a testing ground for new physical and informatics technologies, policies, and behavioral interventions, allowing for unprecedented studies in urban planning and design, urban systems engineering and management, and the social sciences. Focusing on the neighborhood scale also allows for meaningful interaction with, and participation by, the people who live, work, and play in that space and shifts the emphasis of data-driven design away from top-down routinization to a human-centric problem-solving. This paper presents the conceptual framework and justification for the QC, built on the lessons learned from three initial deployments in New York City, and a networked experimental environment of neighborhood labs.",Kontokosta C.,Journal,Journal of Urban Technology,2016-10-01,New York University,Big Data ;  Civic Technology ;  Computational Planning and Design ;  Neighborhood Planning ;  Urban Systems and Sensing
Agricultural knowledge aggregation and innovation based on associative network: a case study of mowers in China,"Innovation is an eternal theme. Innovation is generally considered to be the result of a process that brings together various novel ideas in a way that they have an impact on society. The quality and number of patents is considered as an important indicator of innovation capacity of a country or a region. 875 inventions which were applied in China from 2006 to 2015 in the field of mowers are analyzed to reveal the features of the innovation. Knowledge aggregation and associative network were used to reveal cooperative relationship among inventors and co-occurrence of classification codes. The inventions were analyzed from several aspects, including applicants, inventors, classification cords and patent citations. Distribution of each indicator and their co-occurrence are analyzed to reveal the related innovation activities. The majority of inventions disperse according to applicants and inventors. The hot topic of inventions in the field of mower was found. It was also found that there was linguistic preference of the inventors. And no more than 30% of the inventions cited other patents and non-patent references. The network of citations from the inventions to other patents was drawn. The knowledge transfer from basic research (in the form of non-patent reference) to inventions is implicit, which should be paid more attention to.",Cheng N.; Dong K.,Journal,Wuhan Daxue Xuebao (Xinxi Kexue Ban)/Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University,2016-10-01,Huazhong Agricultural University;Wuhan University,Associative network ;  Co-occurrence ;  Data visualization ;  Electric network topology ;  Information analysis ;  Innovation ;  Knowledge aggregation ;  Knowledge engineering ;  Lawn mowers ;  Patents and inventions

Reproducing an innovation environment in the classroom. An strategy to promote creativity in Chemical Engineering education,"The teaching-learning process in traditional college education uses strategies that place the student as a recipient of information transmitted by the teacher, which is conceptualized as knowledge. The reality in which we live requires generating training solutions to meet the needs of individuals in the development of skills or know-how to respond to society, to form individuals capable of learning to learn and learning to transfer, prepared to continually seek knowledge and able to create and innovate. In this paper, the results of the implementation of the strategy ‘Reproducing an Innovation Environment in the Classroom’ (RAIS) in courses of the Chemical Engineering curriculum, in Universidad de Los Andes, Mérida-Venezuela are presented. This is a strategy of teaching, learning and assessment in which the student is a co-participant in the construction and generation of knowledge, developing the skills proposed in the course by the execution of a product. RAIS strategy was applied in the courses of Physical Chemistry for Chemical Engineers, Industrial Chemistry I and Laboratory of Industrial Chemistry, where students obtained a finished product using the know-how in the area of each course. This strategy led to an increase in motivation over other courses based on lectures, and the development of the ability to function and find solutions in multidisciplinary groups workplaces. It is important to note that more than 80% of students said the RAIS strategy contributes to their personal development and training for applied research.",Márquez R.; Tolosa L.; Gómez R.; Izaguirre C.; Rennola L.; Bullón J.; Sandia B.,Journal,Educacion Quimica,2016-10-01,"Universidad De Los Andes, Merida",Creativity ;  Innovation ;  Know-how ;  Product learning ;  Skills in chemical engineering
Increasing the impact of medical image computing using community-based open-access hackathons: The NA-MIC and 3D Slicer experience,"The National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) was launched in 2004 with the goal of investigating and developing an open source software infrastructure for the extraction of information and knowledge from medical images using computational methods. Several leading research and engineering groups participated in this effort that was funded by the US National Institutes of Health through a variety of infrastructure grants. This effort transformed 3D Slicer from an internal, Boston-based, academic research software application into a professionally maintained, robust, open source platform with an international leadership and developer and user communities. Critical improvements to the widely used underlying open source libraries and tools—VTK, ITK, CMake, CDash, DCMTK—were an additional consequence of this effort. This project has contributed to close to a thousand peer-reviewed publications and a growing portfolio of US and international funded efforts expanding the use of these tools in new medical computing applications every year. In this editorial, we discuss what we believe are gaps in the way medical image computing is pursued today; how a well-executed research platform can enable discovery, innovation and reproducible science (“Open Science”); and how our quest to build such a software platform has evolved into a productive and rewarding social engineering exercise in building an open-access community with a shared vision.",Kapur T.; Pieper S.; Fedorov A.; Fillion-Robin J.; Halle M.; O'Donnell L.; Lasso A.; Ungi T.; Pinter C.; Finet J.; Pujol S.; Jagadeesan J.; Tokuda J.; Norton I.; Estepar R.; Gering D.; Aerts H.; Jakab M.; Hata N.; Ibanez L.; Blezek D.; Miller J.; Aylward S.; Grimson W.; Fichtinger G.; Wells W.; Lorensen W.; Schroeder W.; Kikinis R.,Journal,Medical Image Analysis,2016-10-01,"Kitware, Inc.;Massachusetts Institute of Technology;Brigham and Women's Hospital;Google LLC;Mayo Clinic;HealthMyne, Inc.;Emeritus;Queens University;General Electric Research;Isomics, Inc",3D Slicer ;  Hackathon ;  Medical image computing ;  NA-MIC ;  Open access ;  Open science ;  Open source ;  Project week ;  Reproducible research
From computer-assisted intervention research to clinical impact: The need for a holistic approach,"The early days of the field of medical image computing (MIC) and computer-assisted intervention (CAI), when publishing a strong self-contained methodological algorithm was enough to produce impact, are over. As a community, we now have substantial responsibility to translate our scientific progresses into improved patient care. In the field of computer-assisted interventions, the emphasis is also shifting from the mere use of well-known established imaging modalities and position trackers to the design and combination of innovative sensing, elaborate computational models and fine-grained clinical workflow analysis to create devices with unprecedented capabilities. The barriers to translating such devices in the complex and understandably heavily regulated surgical and interventional environment can seem daunting. Whether we leave the translation task mostly to our industrial partners or welcome, as researchers, an important share of it is up to us. We argue that embracing the complexity of surgical and interventional sciences is mandatory to the evolution of the field. Being able to do so requires large-scale infrastructure and a critical mass of expertise that very few research centres have. In this paper, we emphasise the need for a holistic approach to computer-assisted interventions where clinical, scientific, engineering and regulatory expertise are combined as a means of moving towards clinical impact. To ensure that the breadth of infrastructure and expertise required for translational computer-assisted intervention research does not lead to a situation where the field advances only thanks to a handful of exceptionally large research centres, we also advocate that solutions need to be designed to lower the barriers to entry. Inspired by fields such as particle physics and astronomy, we claim that centralised very large innovation centres with state of the art technology and health technology assessment capabilities backed by core support staff and open interoperability standards need to be accessible to the wider computer-assisted intervention research community.",Ourselin S.; Emberton M.; Vercauteren T.,Journal,Medical Image Analysis,2016-10-01,University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust;University College London,Computer-assisted intervention ;  Health technology assessment ;  Medical devices ;  Valley of death
Understanding TRIZ through the review of top cited publications,"The development of the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) has not followed the usual patterns of scientific validation required by engineering methods. Consequently, its outreach within engineering design is interpreted differently in the scholarly community. At the same time, the claimed powerful support in tackling technical problems of any degree of difficulty conflicts with TRIZ diffusion in industrial settings, which is relatively low according to insights into product development practices. The mismatch between ambitious goals and moderate spill-over benefits in the industry ranges among the various open issues concerning TRIZ, its way of thinking, its effectiveness, the usability of its tools. In order to provide a general overview of TRIZ in science, the authors have attempted to analyse reliable and influential sources from the literature. The performed survey includes the top 100 indexed publications concerning TRIZ, according to the number of received citations. Variegated and poorly interconnected research directions emerge in the abundant literature that tackles TRIZ-related topics. The outcomes of the investigation highlight the successful implementation of TRIZ within, among the others, biomimetics and information processing. The traditional borders of mechanical and industrial engineering have been frequently crossed, as the use of TRIZ is also witnessed in the domain of business and services. At the same time, computer-aided platforms represent diffused attempts to boost TRIZ diffusion and applicability.",Chechurin L.; Borgianni Y.,Journal,Computers in Industry,2016-10-01,LUT kauppakorkeakoulu;Free University of Bozen-Bolzano,Computer-Aided Innovation ;  Conceptual design ;  Industrial practice ;  Information processing ;  TRIZ
"Spirally welded steel wind towers: Buckling experiments, analyses, and research needs","The most common wind tower structure, a tapered tubular steel monopole, is currently limited to heights of ~ 80 m due to transportation constraints which arise because tower sections are manufactured at centralized plants and transported to site for assembly. The need to transport the sections imposes a limit on their size, whereby maximum tower diameters are dictated by bridge clearances rather than by structural efficiency. New manufacturing innovations, based on automated spiral welding, may enable on-site production of wind towers, thereby precluding transportation limits and permitting the manufacture of taller towers, which can harvest the steadier, stronger winds at higher elevations. Taller towers, however, are expected to have cross-sections with slenderness that is uncommon in structural engineering (i.e., diameter-to-thickness ratios up to ~ 500) and much larger than those of conventionally manufactured towers (i.e., diameter-to-thickness ratios up to ~ 300). Tubular structures with highly slender cross-sections are imperfection-sensitive, and the welding process is known to influence imperfections. To account for this sensitivity, slender tubes are usually designed based on empirical knockdown factors, however there are few experiments of tubes in flexure with slenderness as high as what is expected for spirally welded wind towers, and there are no experiments on tubes within this slenderness range and manufactured with spiral welding. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art for designing spirally welded tubes as wind towers and identifies deficiencies. Relevant experimental and analytical research is summarized and research needs to efficiently design tapered spirally welded steel tubes as wind towers are identified.",Jay A.; Myers A.; Torabian S.; Mahmoud A.; Smith E.; Agbayani N.; Schafer B.,Journal,Journal of Constructional Steel Research,2016-10-01,Whiting School of Engineering;College of Engineering;Agbayani Structural Engineering,Imperfections ;  Local buckling ;  Slender tubes ;  Spiral weld ;  Wind turbine tower
Can Carbon Nanomaterials Improve CZTS Photovoltaic Devices? Evaluation of Performance and Impacts Using Integrated Life-Cycle Assessment and Decision Analysis,"In emergent photovoltaics, nanoscale materials hold promise for optimizing device characteristics; however, the related impacts remain uncertain, resulting in challenges to decisions on strategic investment in technology innovation. We integrate multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and life-cycle assessment (LCA) results (LCA-MCDA) as a method of incorporating values of a hypothetical federal acquisition manager into the assessment of risks and benefits of emerging photovoltaic materials. Specifically, we compare adoption of copper zinc tin sulfide (CZTS) devices with molybdenum back contacts to alternative devices employing graphite or graphene instead of molybdenum. LCA impact results are interpreted alongside benefits of substitution including cost reductions and performance improvements through application of multi-attribute utility theory. To assess the role of uncertainty we apply Monte Carlo simulation and sensitivity analysis. We find that graphene or graphite back contacts outperform molybdenum under most scenarios and assumptions. The use of decision analysis clarifies potential advantages of adopting graphite as a back contact while emphasizing the importance of mitigating conventional impacts of graphene production processes if graphene is used in emerging CZTS devices. Our research further demonstrates that a combination of LCA and MCDA increases the usability of LCA in assessing product sustainability. In particular, this approach identifies the most influential assumptions and data gaps in the analysis and the areas in which either engineering controls or further data collection may be necessary.",Scott R.; Cullen A.; Fox-Lent C.; Linkov I.,Journal,Risk Analysis,2016-10-01,The United States Army Corps of Engineers;University of Washington,Emerging technologies ;  graphene ;  life-cycle impact assessment ;  multi-criteria decision analysis ;  nanotechnology
Learning to collaborate through collaboration: How allying with expert firms influences collaborative innovation within novice firms,"Research summary: Strategic alliances have been recognized as a means for firms to learn their partners' proprietary knowledge; such alliances are also valuable opportunities for partner firms to learn tacit organizational routines from their counterparts. We consider how relatively novice technology firms can learn intraorganizational collaborative routines from more experienced alliance partners and then deploy them independently for their own innovative pursuits. We examine the alliance relationships between Eli Lilly & Co. (Lilly), a recognized expert in collaborative innovation, and 55 small biotech partner firms. Using three levels of analysis (firm, patent, and inventor dyad), we find that greater social interaction between the partner firm and Lilly subsequently increases internal collaboration among the partner firm's inventors. Managerial summary: Can collaborating externally advance internal collaboration? Yes. Our research found that collaboration among scientists at small, early-stage biotechnology firms significantly increased after these firms formed highly interactive R&D alliances with a large pharmaceutical company known for its expertise in such collaboration. It is well known that alliances help new firms learn specific new technologies and commercialize innovations. Our study broadens the scope of potential benefits of alliances. New firms can also learn collaboration techniques, deploying them internally to enhance their own abilities in collaborative innovation. Managers should take this additional benefit into consideration in developing their alliance strategies. Pursuing alliance partners with expertise in collaboration and keeping a high level of mutual interactions with partner firm personnel should be important considerations to extract this value.

Technology commercialization in entrepreneurial universities: the US and Russian experience,"US universities are leading the way in technology commercialization, while universities in Russia lag far behind. This paper discusses the best American practices, as well as the main issues of technology commercialization at the US universities. As an example, we consider the experience of the University of Maryland, College Park. In the next section, we turn to technology commercialization in Russia, where it struggles for several reasons. In this paper, we propose that Russia can improve its technology commercialization by studying the example of the leading US entrepreneurial universities and implementing proper procedures. And the important overarching point is that Russian universities need to improve their collaboration with industry, and they need to develop new standards of administrative, research, and business activity that will promote innovation and entrepreneurship.",Carayannis E.; Cherepovitsyn A.; Ilinova A.,Journal,Journal of Technology Transfer,2016-10-01,Saint Petersburg Mining University;The George Washington University,Entrepreneurial university ;  Technology entrepreneurship ;  Technology innovation ;  Technology transfer and commercialization
"Research on layout optimization of Industrial land based on space safety diagnosis: Case study of Beichen district, Tianjin","Beichen district of Tianjin, located in the important node of Beijing-Tianjin golden corridor and high-tech industry area of Jingjintang region, has strong industrial foundations, while it is still faced with the problems that traditional industries account for high proportion of the industrial structure, inefficient use of industrial land, lack of enterprise innovation ability and shortage of resources, etc. With increasingly competitive between cities and regions, upgrading of an industrial structure and spatial distribution optimization become the inevitable trend, which will become a really hotspot issue that attracted widespread attention from domestic and international experts and scholars who engaged in the field of economics, geography, science and ecology planning, and so on. Therefore, this paper, taking perspectives from industrial land structure and distribution security, employing some quantitative analysis methods such as GIS spatial analysis, mathematical model and statistic analysis, combining with the present industrial development of Beichen district, drawing lessons from the study on the evaluation of land intensive use and land suitability evaluation by other scholars, builds an index system of industrial land safety diagnosis from the five aspects of natural location, economic foundation, social coordination, ecological security and policy support, which have more important effects on the distribution of industrial land, and it comes up with the multi-source data multistage evaluation framework with the idea of 'red line controlling for first screening-single factor evaluation-spatial association analysis' in order to conduct diagnostic evaluation of industrial land security distribution, drawing the classification map about each factor which influenced industrial safety layout on Beichen district. Finally, we get the space safety layout area of Beichen district industry by using the evaluation result to do overlay analysis when the land use control chart and the red line control zones were digitized by ArcGIS, and achieve security hierarchy industrial land layout of Beichen district. The results show that safety degree of Beichen district industrial land layout is just at an ordinary level, even some industrial points are still within the scope of red line control area. It is necessary to optimize the spatial layout of the industrial land in consideration of reasonable industrial land scale in Beichen district, and to realize coordinated development between industrial land, regional society, economy and environment. Besides, the result could provide a basic reference for Tianjin land bureau and related planning department to make an objective evaluation on land resources and make an effective use of the land.",Gao X.; Huang Q.; Zhang L.; Bian J.; Wang L.; Chen X.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 5th International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics, Agro-Geoinformatics 2016",2016-09-26,Tiangong University,Industrial land ;  Layout optimization ;  Space safety evaluation ;  Spatial analysis

A Pilot Case Study on Innovative Behaviour: Lessons Learned and Directions for Future Work,"Context: A case study is a powerful research strategy for investigating complex social-technical and managerial phenomena in real life settings. However, when the phenomenon has not been fully discovered or understood, pilot case studies are important to refine the research problem, the research variables, and the case study design before launching a full-scale investigation. The role of pilot case studies has not been fully addressed in empirical software engineering research literature. Objective: To explore the use of pilot case studies in the design of full-scale case studies, and to report the main lessons learned from an industrial pilot study. Method: We designed and conducted an exploratory case study to identify new relevant research variables that influence the innovative behaviour of software engineers in the industrial setting and to refine the full-scale case study design for the next phase of our research. Results: The use of a pilot case study identified several important research variables that were missing in the initial framework. The pilot study also supported a more sophisticated case study design, which was used to guide a full-scale study. Conclusions: When a research topic is has not been fully discovered or understood, it is difficult to create a case study design that covers the relevant research variables and their potential relationships. Conducting a full-scale case study using an untested case design can lead to waste of resources and time if the design has to be reworked during the study. In these situations, the use of pilot case studies can significantly improve the case study design.",Monteiro C.; Da Silva F.; Capretz L.,Conference Proceeding,International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement,2016-09-08,Universidade Federal de Pernambuco;Western University;Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco,case study design ;  innovation ;  Innovative behaviour ;  pilot case study ;  research methodology ;  software engineering
The Innovative Behaviour of Software Engineers: Findings from a Pilot Case Study,"Context: In the workplace, some individuals engage in the voluntary and intentional generation, promotion, and realization of new ideas for the benefit of individual performance, group effectiveness, or the organization. The literature classifies this phenomenon as innovative behaviour. Despite its importance to the development of innovation, innovative behaviour has not been fully investigated in software engineering. Objective: To understand the factors that support or inhibit innovative behaviour in software engineering practice. Method: We conducted a pilot case study in a Canadian software company using interviews and observations as data collection techniques. Using qualitative analysis, we identified relevant factors and relationships not addressed by studies from other areas. Results: Individual innovative behaviour is influenced by individual attitudes and also by situational factors such as relationships in the workplace, organizational characteristics, and project type. We built a model to express the interacting effects of these factors. Conclusions: Innovative behaviour is dependent on individual and contextual factors. Our results contribute to relevant impacts on research and practice, and to topics that deserve further study.",Monteiro C.; Da Silva F.; Capretz L.,Conference Proceeding,International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement,2016-09-08,Universidade Federal de Pernambuco;Western University;Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco,innovation ;  innovative behaviour ;  pilot case study ;  software engineering

Quality Estimation of Dry Grinding of Skiving Cutters with Organic Bonding Diamond Wheels,Engineering process preparation requires proper preparation of cutting tools. It influences not only the performance of the tools but also the quality of workpiece surface machining. One of the promising environmentally friendly trends of mechanical treatment is grinding without using lubricating cooling liquid. This method can considerably influence the quality of cutting tools grinding. Smoothing skiving turning is an effective treatment method providing high efficiency and workpiece quality. Proper preparation of cutting edges is especially important in this process. For that purpose we have carried out a research in grinding changeable carbide inserts for skiving turning by means of grinding wheels with different grain size. The influence of different combinations of wheels on roughness of the inserts front and rear surfaces and quality of cutting edge was studied with the help of laser confocal microscopy.,Filippov A.; Shamarin N.; Podgornykh O.; Rubtsov V.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2016-09-02,"Tomsk Polytechnic University;Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences",
Empirical assessment of the time course of innovation in biomedical engineering: First results of a comparative approach,"The pathway from the flash of a technological invention until its use as a medical device in every day care is tedious and burdensome. But the often postulated acceleration has to balance the speed of innovation and the indispensable product safety by an improved understanding of the innovation cycle. While several studies investigated the time course of pharmaceutical innovation, a comparable empirical analysis of medical devices is lacking. Thus we evaluated the time between the patent priority date and the corresponding receipt of the CE mark as a function of a medical device risk class in 61 cases. The statistical analysis yielded a time increment (trend) from medical devices in risk category I (median = 5.8 years) compared to risk category III (median = 10.4 years), which is close to literature reported values for drug development (9–12 years). The difference between products in risk classes I and II did not reach significance. To investigate the underlying facts, a text-mining approach especially to resolve the ambiguity of, e.g. patents, CE Marks etc. is suggested for increasing the sample size.",Farkas R.; Puiu A.; Hamadeh N.; Bukowski M.; Schmitz-Rode T.,Journal,Current Directions in Biomedical Engineering,2016-09-01,Uniklinik RWTH Aachen,Information retrieval ;  Medical device ;  Pace ;  Technology transfer ;  Time lag ;  Translational research

Understanding innovations in Malaysia’s construction industry: a study of four large national firms,"Little published work exists on innovation in construction, which is not helped by the diverse set of activities that characterise the industry. The early attempt to category sources of innovation in the industry depicted it as a supplier driven industry using large data sets from secondary sources. Given the lack of profound firm-level research in the industry, this paper uses four case studies of national firms in Malaysia to examine innovation in the industry. The evidence shows that major innovations in these firms evolve as a crystallization of project demand that drives firms to seek external sources of knowledge that is adapted to meet the construction demand of clients. In doing so two firms demonstrated radical innovations as its diffusion has transformed construction in Malaysia. The remaining two firms are engaged in incremental engineering activities. Also, innovations in two firms were led by their own managements, while the remaining two were supplier-led. In addition, while innovations in all four firms are characterised by re-conceptualisation of foreign sources of knowledge, innovation in one firm involved architectural designing and another modularisation. A blend of institutions constituted by government policy, in-house command, trust and collaborative practices, markets, and industry standards have shaped these innovations.",Chang Y.; Rasiah R.; Chan W.,Journal,Asian Journal of Technology Innovation,2016-09-01,Universiti Malaya,collaboration ;  incremental innovation ;  institutions ;  leadership ;  trust

A bibliometric analysis of the development of next generation active nanotechnologies,"Delineating the emergence of nanotechnologies that offer new functionalities is an important element in an anticipatory approach to the governance of nanotechnology and its potential impacts. This paper examines the transition to next generation active nanotechnologies which incorporate functions that respond to the environment or systems concepts that combine devices and structures that are dynamic and which may change their states in use. We develop an approach to identifying these active nanotechnologies and then use bibliometric analysis to examine the extent of research papers and patents involving these concepts. We also examine references to environmental, health, and safety concepts in these papers, given that these next generation nanotechnologies are likely to have risk profiles that are different from those of first-generation passive nanomaterials. Our results show a steady growth overall in focus on active nanotechnologies in the research literature and in patents over the study period of 1990–2010. We also find an increase in consideration given to environmental, health, and safety topics. While gaps are highlighted in our understanding of research and innovation in active nanotechnologies, the results suggest that there is beginning to be a shift to active nanotechnologies, with the implication that governance processes need to be conscious of this shift and to prepare for it.",Suominen A.; Li Y.; Youtie J.; Shapira P.,Journal,Journal of Nanoparticle Research,2016-09-01,Teknologian Tutkimuskeskus VTT;Georgia Institute of Technology;The University of Manchester,"Active nanotechnology ;  Bibliometrics ;  Environmental, health, and safety ;  Science and technology survey ;  Systems of nanotechnology"

Xenomicrobiology: a roadmap for genetic code engineering,"Biology is an analytical and informational science that is becoming increasingly dependent on chemical synthesis. One example is the high-throughput and low-cost synthesis of DNA, which is a foundation for the research field of synthetic biology (SB). The aim of SB is to provide biotechnological solutions to health, energy and environmental issues as well as unsustainable manufacturing processes in the frame of naturally existing chemical building blocks. Xenobiology (XB) goes a step further by implementing non-natural building blocks in living cells. In this context, genetic code engineering respectively enables the re-design of genes/genomes and proteins/proteomes with non-canonical nucleic (XNAs) and amino (ncAAs) acids. Besides studying information flow and evolutionary innovation in living systems, XB allows the development of new-to-nature therapeutic proteins/peptides, new biocatalysts for potential applications in synthetic organic chemistry and biocontainment strategies for enhanced biosafety. In this perspective, we provide a brief history and evolution of the genetic code in the context of XB. We then discuss the latest efforts and challenges ahead for engineering the genetic code with focus on substitutions and additions of ncAAs as well as standard amino acid reductions. Finally, we present a roadmap for the directed evolution of artificial microbes for emancipating rare sense codons that could be used to introduce novel building blocks. The development of such xenomicroorganisms endowed with a ‘genetic firewall’ will also allow to study and understand the relation between code evolution and horizontal gene transfer.",Acevedo-Rocha C.; Budisa N.,Journal,Microbial Biotechnology,2016-09-01,The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability;Technische Universität Berlin;BIOSYNTIA APS,
Multilocalisation and the Growth of Knowledge Assets in Medium-Sized Multinationals (MSMs),"This work aims to investigate how international competitive strategies are based and may be in some cases actually heavily dependent on the capacity to form and enhance skills in design, engineering and production activities and on the propensity to invest more resources in research and development (R&D) activities as well as in activities that are more strictly speaking production-based (manufacturing). This study focuses on medium-sized multinationals (MSMs) that belong to the sectors of mechanics and electronics and highlights different innovation processes’ approaches in the same unit of the analysed MSMs. We should draw attention to the propensity of Marche’s MSMs to effectively take advantage of new process technologies and their ability to increase the innovative knowledge possessed co-evolve with planning and managing multiplant establishments on a global scale. This would mean that, for smaller businesses, the complex process of ‘generation, use, acquisition and dissemination’ of technological knowledge would derive mainly from internal factors and be only limited by external sources.

Biotech in Hong Kong: How biologist-entrepreneurs pursued “Hong Kong’s bioscience dream”,"This article aims to put Hong Kong on the map of East Asia’s biotech studies by identifying the major themes of biotech innovation specific to the citystate’s colonial past and postcolonial present and future. I provide evidence of a concerted effort led by biologist-entrepreneurs to promote the biotech industry in postcolonial Hong Kong. Through assessing scientific literature, media representations, business strategies, and programmatic visions of key scientist-entrepreneurs in Hong Kong’s biotech enterprise, I highlight how factors such as local history and geopolitical considerations shape the emerging “Hong Kong’s bioscience dream.” Using the recent discovery of a new recombinant anticancer drug, pegylated human recombinant arginase (BCT-100), as a case in point, I explore how biotech research and applications are marketed and interpreted in relation to Hong Kong’s unique historical, political, and cultural context, thus making it distinct from other Asian Tigers. My analysis of the featured recombinant drug reveals a set of uniquely Hong Kong–centered cultural meanings attributed to biopharmaceutical research and benefits. This case reflects how genetic engineering and biotech research are configured and imagined within the context of the postcolonial Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.",Luk C.,Journal,"East Asian Science, Technology and Society",2016-09-01,The University of Hong Kong,BCT-100 ;  Biologists ;  Biotech ;  Cancer therapy ;  Entrepreneurs ;  Hong Kong SAR ;  Pharmaceutical
Understanding university faculty perceptions about innovation in teaching and technology,"The purpose of this research is to understand faculty perceptions about innovation in teaching and technology in a college of education in a research-intensive university. This study was motivated by the creation of a new initiative begun in a large college of education at a Carnegie Research-Intensive university to promote innovation in teaching with the support and creative use of technology. This study used Q methodology, a mixed methods research design involving quantitative and qualitative analysis of descriptive data derived by a sorting activity. Results showed four emerging profiles about how faculty perceive innovation in teaching and technology. Faculty comprising three of these profiles shared the characteristic of valuing technology's role in teaching, though in different, nuanced ways. Faculty representing the fourth profile, in contrast, were generally cautious and skeptical of using technology for teaching. Implications of the study are discussed, including the caution not to assume that college faculty share meaning for words like “innovation in teaching and technology.” Also, the results of this study are useful to understanding theories of innovation based on faculty's perceptions of their ability to adapt to rapidly changing and ever-increasing technology innovations for teaching.",Kopcha T.; Rieber L.; Walker B.,Journal,British Journal of Educational Technology,2016-09-01,University of Georgia,

Expanded benefits for humanity from the International Space Station,"In 2012, the International Space Station (ISS) (Fig. 1) partnership published the updated International Space Station Benefits for Humanity [1], a compilation of stories about the many benefits being realized in the areas of human health, Earth observations and disaster response, and global education. This compilation has recently been revised to include updated statistics on the impacts of the benefits, and new benefits that have developed since the first publication. Two new sections have also been added to the book, economic development of space and innovative technology. This paper will summarize the updates on behalf of the ISS Program Science Forum, made up of senior science representatives across the international partnership. The new section on “Economic Development of Space” highlights case studies from public-private partnerships that are leading to a new economy in low earth orbit (LEO). Businesses provide both transportation to the ISS as well as some research facilities and services. These relationships promote a paradigm shift of government-funded, contractor-provided goods and services to commercially-provided goods purchased by government agencies. Other examples include commercial firms spending research and development dollars to conduct investigations on ISS and commercial service providers selling services directly to ISS users. This section provides examples of ISS as a test bed for new business relationships, and illustrates successful partnerships. The second new section, “Innovative Technology,” merges technology demonstration and physical science findings that promise to return Earth benefits through continued research. Robotic refueling concepts for life extensions of costly satellites in geo-synchronous orbit have applications to robotics in industry on Earth. Flame behavior experiments reveal insight into how fuel burns in microgravity leading to the possibility of improving engine efficiency on Earth. Nanostructures and smart fluids are examples of materials improvements that are being developed using data from ISS. The publication also expands the benefits of research results in human health, environmental change and disaster response and in education activities developed to capture student imaginations in support of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, or STEM, education internationally. Applications to human health of the knowledge gained on ISS continue to grow and improve healthcare technologies and our understanding of human physiology. Distinct benefits return to Earth from the only orbiting multi-disciplinary laboratory of its kind.

Process innovation as creative problem solving: An experimental study of textual descriptions and diagrams,The use of process models to support business analysts’ idea-generation tasks has been a long-standing topic of interest in process improvement. We examine how two types of representations of organizational processes – textual and diagrammatic – assist analysts in developing innovative solutions to process-redesign tasks. The results of our study clarify the types of process-redesign ideas generated by analysts who work with text versus those who work with models. We find that the volume and originality of process-redesign ideas do not differ significantly but that appropriateness of ideas varies. We discuss the implications of these findings for research and practice in process improvement.,Figl K.; Recker J.,Journal,Information and Management,2016-09-01,Queensland University of Technology;WU Vienna University of Economics and Business,Business process models ;  Business process reengineering ;  Creative problem solving ;  Diagrams ;  Process innovation
Progressively evaluating a penaeid W trawl to improve eco-efficiency,"The W trawl is a proposed innovation for more eco-efficient penaeid trawling-via reduced energy intensity and benthic contact. A significant portion of the drag-generated, netting tension of the W trawl is directed away from the wings to centre-line bracing ropes that are connected to a central towing wire through an intermediary sled. This configuration facilitates substantially smaller otter boards than normal, and consequently less drag and seabed contact. Here we compared the engineering and catching implications of subtle, progressive rigging changes to a W trawl paired against a standard Florida flyer trawl; both rigged with another eco-efficient modification, termed the 'batwing' otter board (suitably sized for each trawl). The W-trawl refinements included: (i) securing netting at the wing ends to prevent sliding; (ii) moving the headline forward and footrope aft; and (iii) inserting dan lenos at the wing ends. The first two modifications resulted in a maximum drag reduction by the W trawl of up to 11% for a 1.14 × increase in spread. Catches ha-1 of mostly retained (commercially important) large brachyurans and cephalopods were maintained, but penaeid catches were reduced in the W trawl (by at least 33%), which was mostly attributed to less than optimal ground-gear contact. This study provides a base for future research to concurrently reduce the energy intensity and habitat impacts of penaeid trawls, via holistic modifications.",Balash C.; Sterling D.; Broadhurst M.,Journal,Fisheries Research,2016-09-01,Sterling Trawl Gear Services;The University of Queensland;Australian Maritime College;NSW Department of Primary Industries,Batwing otter board ;  Drag reduction ;  Selectivity ;  Trawling eco-efficiency ;  W trawl
Technological proximity and recombinative innovation in the alternative energy field,"Recombination of knowledge elements has been recognized as important innovation activities. This study aims to develop a new measurement of recombinative innovation and firstly explores its antecedents at the country-dyad level. We analyze 41,007 US alternative energy patents granted between 1976 and 2012. Based on multi-source data and longitudinal design, Quadratic Assignment Procedure (QAP) model results indicate that two countries' technological proximity (TP) takes an inverted U-shaped relationship with their recombinative innovation (RI), which means that TP could raise the potential of joint recombination, but should not become too high because of great knowledge homogenization. Furthermore, we test two types of distances (i.e., cultural and geographical) as moderators of the relationship between TP and RI. Cultural distance negatively moderates the relationship between TP and RI, but moderating role of geographical distance is not supported in this research. The findings of this study, besides having implications for management and policy, have implications on the research of recombinative innovation, inter-national collaboration and partner selection strategy.",Guan J.; Yan Y.,Journal,Research Policy,2016-09-01,University of Chinese Academy of Sciences,Alternative energy ;  Cultural distance ;  Geographical distance ;  Recombinative innovation ;  Technological proximity
Digital factory system for dynamic manufacturing network supporting networked collaborative product development,"During the last years, important research investments have been made by Airbus Group Innovations for the establishment of sustainable Product and Process data interoperability based on open standards.

Driven by factory of the future-related research, the dynamic manufacturing network (DMN) concept enriched the framework, which aims at providing agile infrastructure for networked collaborative product development. For such networks, protocols based on open eBusiness product lifecycle management (PLM) standards for exchange and sharing of product and process data between the implied organizations, their processes and the technical enteprise applications supporting these processes are needed This paper presents a new way of combining model-based enterprise platform engineering, model-driven architecture, and system engineering in order to adress the establishment of a sustainable interoperability within DMN. Based on relevant litterature interoperability issues, this paper describes the new approach, which relies on the association of effective existing technologies coupled with research results on the fields of model-driven engineering (MDE), enterprise interoperability, system engineering and PLM. The new approach relies on the concept of digital factory system (DFS) coupled with DMN in order to produce sustainable and agile collaborative infrastructure for manufacturing digital ebusiness ecosystem.

Smart roadmapping for STI policy,"Roadmapping is a broadly applied management instrument for developing and implementing company technology and innovation strategies. During the last years this national science, technology and innovation (STI) policy makers have become aware of the potential roadmapping offers for strategic technology and innovation management and begun applying it in the context of STI policy and priority setting in this context especially. Still reality shows that roadmapping for STI policy purposes is by far more complex than company technology and innovation roadmapping. The article therefore develops a structured, integrated and flexible approach to roadmapping for STI policy which we name “Smart Roadmapping for STI Policy”, taking into account the complexity of STI policy as well as the need for and implications of a Targeted Open Innovation approach to STI policy and the resulting requirements to roadmaps. The proposed approach is designed to allow integration in the broader policy decision making and different level STI strategy implementation.",Carayannis E.; Grebeniuk A.; Meissner D.,Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2016-09-01,HSE University;The George Washington University,Innovation policy ;  Policy roadmap ;  Smart roadmapping ;  STI policy ;  STI policy ;  STI policy mix ;  Targeted Open Innovation

A systematic literature review of modular product design (MPD) from the perspective of sustainability,"Modular product design (MPD), as its name implies, subdivides complicated products and systems into components and considers them individually instead of as an amalgamated whole. Because of its merit in reducing complexity, MPD is widely used in engineering fields, especially in design engineering. Over the last decade, increasing concerns about environmental impact have driven manufacturers to reconsider their product design processes from the view of sustainability. The blending of these concepts—modularity and sustainability—has attracted significant attention from both academia and industry. The ways in which sustainability influences MPD are not fully understood, evidencing a gap that needs to be further researched. This review examines more than 100 studies addressing ways MPD is associated with sustainability factors and classifies these studies based on major sustainability themes. The initial review and analysis were conducted using literature summarization tables and a maturity index. Our search emphasized not only the performance of MPD methodologies with respect to sustainability factors but also the relationship between MPD and sustainability categories. Our review results indicate that from an academic perspective, research over the last 15 years has seen a significant increase in studies involving MPD and product life cycles, MPD and product innovation, and MPD and environmental management. Secondarily, our findings reveal that from an industry perspective, the literature shows that modularity has a positive impact on sustainability and identifies several social sustainability-related areas in MPD that could benefit from further investigation.",Ma J.; Kremer G.,Journal,International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,2016-09-01,Penn State College of Engineering,Modular product design (MPD) ;  Sustainability ;  Sustainable product design ;  Systematic literature review
"The evolution of science, technology and innovation policies: A review of the Ghanaian experience","Although there have been considerable past accomplishments in science, technology and innovation policy literature, our understanding of the evolution of government policies in these areas as a country transitions from one political regime to another, remains limited. This paper examines the issue within the context of Ghana, an emerging economy in sub-Saharan Africa, from 1957 to 2012. After a historical review of such government policies, we uncovered three key stages in the evolution of science and technology policy. These include the adoption of the “science for development” strategy and convergence of science and industrial policy from 1957 to 1966. This was then followed by the divergence of science policy and industrial policy from 1967 to the 1990s following the overthrow of Nkrumah's government. The emergence of the “new dawn” from the 2000s onwards ushered in a new policy framework for national science and technology policy geared towards economic development. The study outlines a range of public policy implications.",Amankwah-Amoah.,Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2016-09-01,University of Bristol,Ghana ;  Innovation policy ;  National science ;  Public policy ;  Technology policy
Technology-enhanced learning in college mathematics remediation,"US colleges presently face an academic plight; thousands of high school graduates are performing below the expected ability for college-level mathematics. This paper describes an innovative approach intended to improve the mathematics performance of first-year college students, at a large US university. The innovation involved the integration of faculty-led instruction with technology-enhanced learning (TEL). In this case, TEL refers to a sophisticated software program that delivers mathematics education using an adaptive, self-paced, individualized, mastery-based approach. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the extent to which TEL met the educational requirements of college students in need of remediation and to explore the effects of TEL on students' beliefs about their academic ability and academic behaviors (academic competence). The sample of 2880 included all the students enrolled in a single semester of remedial mathematics. Results suggested successful remediation, as indicated by the end-of-semester course completion rate, with 75% of students eligible to enroll in a first-year sequence mathematics course and an additional 18% on track for eligibility by the following semester. TEL also appeared to have a positive, statistically significant effect on students' learning and academic competence. For these findings, we discuss study limitations and implications for future research.",Foshee C.; Elliott S.; Atkinson R.,Journal,British Journal of Educational Technology,2016-09-01,Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University;Arizona State University,
Designing high-reliability healthcare teams,"Despite serious and widespread efforts to improve the quality of health care, many patients still suffer preventable harm every day. Hospitals find improvement difficult to sustain, and they suffer 'project fatigue' because so many problems need attention. No hospitals or health systems have achieved consistent excellence throughout their institutions. High-reliability science is the study of organizations in industries like commercial aviation and nuclear power that operate under hazardous conditions while maintaining safety levels that are far better than those of health care. A high reliability organization (HRO) is an organization that has succeeded in avoiding catastrophes in an environment where normal accidents can be expected due to risk factors and complexity. The definition of a high reliability organization extends beyond patient safety to encompass quality care - and ultimately value. Recommendations and innovations focused on healthcare individual processes do not address the larger and often intangible systemic and cultural factors that create vulnerabilities throughout the entire system. In addition, an open, transparent, and just culture which would allow a deeper understanding of these factors does not appear to be forthcoming. Adapting and applying the lessons of this science as well as applied human factors thinking to health care offer the promise of enabling hospitals to reach levels of quality and safety that are comparable to those of the best high-reliability organizations. Hospitals can make substantial progress toward high reliability by undertaking several specific organizational change initiatives. Further research and practical experience will be necessary to determine the validity and effectiveness of this framework for high-reliability health care.",Barach P.,Conference Proceeding,IDT 2016 - Proceedings of the International Conference on Information and Digital Technologies 2016,2016-08-31,Wayne State University School of Medicine,Harm Prevention ;  High Reliability Organizations ;  Human Factors ;  Patient Safety ;  Reliability ;  Systems

The biodiversity of temperate extensive green roofs – a review of research and practice,"From its beginnings in Germany in the twentieth century, a thriving extensive green roof industry has become established in many countries in temperate climates. Based upon the success of the industry, and with an expectation that this technology will be adopted in other climates, this review of the ecological research of extensive green roofs aims to evaluate the application of this knowledge. The modern extensive green roof is the product of research in the 1970s by German green roof pioneers; the selection of suitable species from analogue habitats led to green roof vegetation dominated by drought tolerant taxa. The commercial success of extensive green roof systems can be attributed to engineering and horticultural research, to policy mechanisms in some places, and to a market that encourages innovation, and the origins in ecological design are now easily overlooked. Some of the work reviewed here, including the classification of spontaneous roof vegetation into plant communities, is not widely known due to its confinement to the German literature. By re-visiting the history of the extensive green roof and reviewing the ecological research that has contributed to our understanding of it, the intention is, for this paper, to inform those considering green roofs in other climatic regions, to apply an ecologically informed approach in using local knowledge for developing installations that are suited to the bioregion in which they occur. Finally the paper considers some future directions for research and practice.",Thuring C.; Grant G.,Journal,Israel Journal of Ecology and Evolution,2016-08-29,The University of Sheffield;Green Infrastructure Consultancy Ltd.,biodiverse ;  extensive green roof ;  temperate
Thermal protective clothing for firefighters,"Thermal Protective Clothing for Firefighters explores the materials, design, and usage of thermal protective clothing. The characteristics of fire hazards are discussed in detail, and the thermal environments faced by firefighters in these fire hazards are also examined. The different types of potential burn injuries and the heat stress that occurs to firefighters' bodies when exposed to such thermal environments are analyzed.

Carlson iterating and rational approximation of arbitrary order fractional calculus operator,"With the development of factional calculus theory and applications in different fields in recent years, the rational approximation problem of fractional calculus operator has become a hot spot of research. In the early 1950s and 1960s, Carlson and Halijak proposed regular Newton iterating method to implement rational approximation of the one-nth calculus operator. Carlson regular Newton iterating method has a great sense of innovation for the rational approximation of fractional calculus operator, however, it has been used only for certain calculus operators. The aim of this paper is to achieve rational approximation of arbitrary order fractional calculus operator. The realization is achieved via the generalization of Carlson regular Newton iterating method. To construct a rational function sequence which is convergent to irrational fractional calculus operator function, the rational approximation problem of fractional calculus operator is transformed into the algebra iterating solution of arithmetic root of binomial equation. To speed up the convergence, the pre-distortion function is introduced. And the Newton iterating formula is used to solve arithmetic root. Then the approximated rational impedance function of arbitrary order fractional calculus operator is obtained. For nine different operational orders with n changing from 2 to 5, the impedance functions are calculated respectively through choosing eight different initial impedances for a certain operational order. Considering fractional order operation characteristics of the impedance function and the physical realization of network synthesis, the impedance function should satisfy these basic properties simultaneously: computational rationality, positive reality principle and operational validity. In other words, there exists only rational computation of operational variable s in the expression of impedance function. All the zeros and poles of impedance function are located on the negative real axis of s complex plane or the left-half plane of s complex plane in conjugate pairs. The frequency-domain characteristics of impedance function approximate to those of ideal fractional calculus operator over a certain frequency range. Given suitable initial impedance and for an arbitrary operational order, it is proved that the impedance function could meet all properties above by studying the zero-pole distribution and analyzing frequency-domain characteristics of the impedance function. Therefore, the impedance function could take on operational performance of the ideal fractional calculus operator and achieve the physical realization. It is of great effectiveness in the generalization of this kind of method in both theory and experiment. The results educed in this paper are the basis for further theoretic research and engineering application in constructing the arbitrary order fractional circuits and systems.",He Q.; Yuan X.,Journal,Wuli Xuebao/Acta Physica Sinica,2016-08-20,Sichuan University,Carlson rational approximation ;  Fractance approximation circuit ;  Fractional calculus ;  Fractional operator

An Overview of the Development of a GPU with Integrated HBM on Silicon Interposer,"In recent years, the 2.5D IC (Integrated Circuit) package with TSV (Through Silicon Vias) has become important for high-bandwidth and high-performance applications. It is well known that 2.5D technology requires significant innovation in the areas of process technology, packaging, design, thermals, and test solutions leading to several hundred new technologies in a single product. With these complex material sets and process steps combined with new design requirements, methods, and components, a significant amount of research and engineering development is required to bring a successful product to market. After an 8 year development, in July of 2015 AMD reported it began shipment of a new generation of AMD Radeon Fury graphics cards, based on the development of the ""Fiji"" GPU and the first generation of High Bandwidth Memory (HBM1). This announcement is the next major step in an era for 2.5D IC package technology which will be used in a wide variety of applications. Given the scope of this undertaking many collaborations were required. This paper provides an overview of the collaboration between AMD and ASE. It chronicles the work from initial proof of concept to technology feasibility to product development to production ramp and ultimately high volume production.

In situ passive sampling of sediment porewater enhanced by periodic vibration,"Passive sampling for the measurement of freely dissolved concentrations of organic pollutants in sediment porewater has emerged as a promising approach, but in situ measurements are complicated by slow mass transfer of strongly hydrophobic compounds. The primary resistance to mass transfer arises in the sediment side where a concentration depletion layer develops in the vicinity of the polymeric passive sampling material. The slow mass transfer results in underequilibrated passive sampler measurements that need to be corrected for equilibrium, typically by extrapolation of the loss kinetics of performance reference compounds. Such corrections are prone to large errors, especially when deviation from equilibrium is large. In this research we address the challenge of slow mass transfer by disrupting the external depletion layer around an in situ passive sampler. We report an engineering innovation of adapting low-cost vibration motors for periodically disrupting the depletion layer in a passive sampler deployed in sediments. The uptake of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons into polyethylene passive samplers was measured after 7, 14, 28, and 56 days of exposure to sediment under static, vibrating, and fully mixed modes. We demonstrate through laboratory experiments and numerical mass transfer modeling that short periodic shaking of a passive sampler deployed in static sediment enhances the rate of mass transfer and reduces the difference in the extent of equilibrium achieved compared to a well-mixed laboratory equilibrium. The improvement over static sediment deployment is especially evident for the high molecular weight compounds such as benzo(a)pyrene.",Jalalizadeh M.; Ghosh U.,Journal,Environmental Science and Technology,2016-08-16,College of Engineering and Information Technology,

Government intervention in technology innovation system in the catching-up context: Case of TD-LTE technology innovation in China,"China is witnessed to catch up in the field of information technology (IT) through years of technology innovation. Scholars have indicated the significance of the government promotion and efficient technology innovation systems (TIS). Innovation literature about how TIS can be functioned and efficient with government intervention is still insufficient, especially that in catching-up context. This work aims to understand mechanism of government intervention in TIS for achieving technology innovation. Combining TIS frame with institutional perspective, a framework is developed. Underlying with the framework, case of TD-LTE innovation in China is examined based on extensive documentary research and semistructured interviews. Within catching-up context, this paper argues that government is required to exert institutional forces on key components of TIS in different stages to achieve different tasks, both influential and regulative, for innovation purpose.

Teaching bioinspired design using C-K theory,"The engineer of 2020 is expected to not only offer technical ingenuity but also adapt to a continuously evolving environment while being able to operate outside the narrow limits of one discipline and be ethically grounded in solving the complex problems of the future. To address the competencies of the future engineer, undergraduate education must train students to not only solve engineering challenges that transcend disciplinary boundaries but also communicate, transfer knowledge and collaborate across technical and non-technical boundaries. One approach to training engineers in these competencies is teaching biomimicry or bioinspired design in an engineering curriculum, which offers relevance to professional practice as well as an effective hook to frame complex, crossdisciplinary problems. This research aims to address the need for undergraduate student training in multidisciplinary design innovation through the creation of instructional resources grounded in the concept-knowledge theory that scaffolds discovery and knowledge transfer processes such that natural designs can be used to inspire engineering solutions. Qualitative content analysis of second-year engineering student reflection statements shows that the instructional resources resulted in significant learning and engagement.",Nagel J.; Pittman P.; Pidaparti R.; Rose C.; Beverly C.,Journal,"Bioinspired, Biomimetic and Nanobiomaterials",2016-08-01,University of Georgia;James Madison University,Bioinspired ;  Biomimicry ;  Design

Update on Renal Replacement Therapy: Implantable Artificial Devices and Bioengineered Organs,"Recent advances in the fields of artificial organs and regenerative medicine are now joining forces in the areas of organ transplantation and bioengineering to solve continued challenges for patients with end-stage renal disease. The waiting lists for those needing a transplant continue to exceed demand. Dialysis, while effective, brings different challenges, including quality of life and susceptibility to infection. Unfortunately, the majority of research outputs are far from delivering satisfactory solutions. Current efforts are focused on providing a self-standing device able to recapitulate kidney function. In this review, we focus on two remarkable innovations that may offer significant clinical impact in the field of renal replacement therapy: the implantable artificial renal assist device (RAD) and the transplantable bioengineered kidney. The artificial RAD strategy utilizes micromachining techniques to fabricate a biohybrid system able to mimic renal morphology and function. The current trend in kidney bioengineering exploits the structure of the native organ to produce a kidney that is ready to be transplanted. Although these two systems stem from different technological approaches, they are both designed to be implantable, long lasting, and free standing to allow patients with kidney failure to be autonomous. However, for both of them, there are relevant issues that must be addressed before translation into clinical use and these are discussed in this review.",Attanasio C.; Latancia M.; Otterbein L.; Netti P.,Journal,Tissue Engineering - Part B: Reviews,2016-08-01,Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia;Harvard Medical School,

Approaches and recent trends in gene delivery for treatment of atherosclerosis,"Background: The development and progression of atherosclerosis is known to occur at a sluggish pace and the lesions remain concealed for a long duration before the factual situation of the complex atherosclerotic etiology affecting various organ gets apprehended. The root cause mainly involves an imbalance or malfunction of the cholesterol metabolizing pathway. The till date therapeutic alternatives include oral hypo-lipidemic agents along with advances made in biotechnology/tissue engineering and surgical procedures for management purpose. However, with the advent and upsurge of nanotech delivery systems, along with meticulous indulgence and identification of the causative genes in the etiology of disease have opened a new therapeutic area that has far reaching application potential for effective management of such chronic disease requiring lifelong therapy. Methods: Various genes that have implication in atherosclerosis were reviewed along with research in delivery vectors that have been employed for gene therapeutics and hurdles in successful delivery were elaborated. Relevant patents are discussed systematically to clearly support and highlight the developments made. Results: Patenting activity in the delivery of genes for atherosclerosis so far primarily covers use of viral vectors. With the identification of new targets, a list of candidate genes are available that can be potentially exploited for therapeutic purpose. Though the delivery of candidate genes using viral vectors has been well explored, the limitation of viral vectors have seized the much needed clinical success. Non-viral vectors can prove to be the key for conquering this limitations and offer a vast area for exploration for achieving an effective control and remission to the disease and increasing the assortment of patents as reviewed in this article. Conclusion: In view of the many limitations in employing viral vectors for delivery, designing non-viral vectors for successful delivery of therapeutic gene in atherosclerosis should be realized and focused for effective management of the disease.",Lalani R.; Misra A.; Amrutiya J.; Patel H.; Bhatt P.; Patil S.,Journal,Recent Patents on Drug Delivery and Formulation,2016-08-01,The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda,Atherosclerosis ;  Gene delivery ;  Nanotechnology ;  Non-viral vectors ;  Patents ;  Treatment ;  Viral vectors
Science Policy and Concomitant Research in Synthetic Biology—Some Critical Thoughts,"In science policy, public controversy around synthetic biology has often been presented as a major risk because it could deter innovation. The following inter-related strategies for avoiding contestation have been observed: (1) There have been attempts to close down debates by alluding to the importance and legitimacy of reliance on scientific evidence as input to regulatory processes. (2) Scientific policy advice has stressed sufficiency of existing regulation, economic risks of additional regulation and/or suggestions for monitoring that are limited in scope. (3) Initiatives for self-governance have narrowed the scope of topics for consideration. (4) Engagement with humanities, social sciences and arts has been co-opted for legitimisation and science communication. Although such agendas are of course not ubiquitous, in this paper, I criticise that instrumentally motivated engagement has been supported not only by the scientific community but also by policy institutions and funding bodies. I argue that it is good that this now seems to fuel controversy in the academic and policy realms. As synthetic biology is not the only technoscientific field to see such dynamics, this is also part of the broader context of debate about the governance of science, especially the concept of “responsible research and innovation” (RRI) currently promoted in the EU.",Hagen K.,Journal,NanoEthics,2016-08-01,EA European Academy of Technology and Innovation Assessment GmbH,"Ethical, legal and social aspects (ELSA) ;  Genetic engineering ;  Responsible research and innovation (RRI) ;  Science policy ;  Synthetic biology ;  Technology assessment (TA)"
The relationship between knowledge search strategies and absorptive capacity: A deeper look,"The present study analyzes how the breadth and depth of search strategies affect the dimensions of a firm's absorptive capacity: exploration, transformation and exploitation. Results of an analysis of a sample of 467 Spanish manufacturing firms reveal that openness of external knowledge search contributes to firms' exploratory, transformative and exploitative learning processes in different ways. In particular, a strong curvilinear effect of external knowledge search breadth on exploratory and exploitative learning was found. It is also important to establish deep relationships with external agents to achieve transformative and exploitative learning up to a certain point after which relationships become negative. Interestingly, for a firm to develop explorative learning, it is not important to establish deep relationships. And for a firm to develop transformative learning it is not important to establish broad relationships. Some suggestions for managers and future lines of research are provided.",Ferreras-Méndez J.; Fernández-Mesa A.; Alegre J.,Journal,Technovation,2016-08-01,Universidad de León;Universitat de València,Absorptive capacity ;  Exploitative learning ;  Exploratory learning ;  Knowledge search strategies ;  Transformative learning
Putting a price tag on novel autologous cellular therapies,"Cell therapies, especially autologous therapies, pose significant challenges to researchers who wish to move from small, probably academic, methods of manufacture to full commercial scale. There is a dearth of reliable information about the costs of operation, and this makes it difficult to predict with confidence the investment needed to translate the innovations to the clinic, other than as small-scale, clinician-led prescriptions. Here, we provide an example of the results of a cost model that takes into account the fixed and variable costs of manufacture of one such therapy. We also highlight the different factors that influence the product final pricing strategy. Our findings illustrate the need for cooperative and collective action by the research community in pre-competitive research to generate the operational models that are much needed to increase confidence in process development for these advanced products.",Abou-El-Enein M.; Bauer G.; Medcalf N.; Volk H.; Reinke P.,Journal,Cytotherapy,2016-08-01,"Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin;University of California, Davis;Loughborough University",adoptive T-cell therapy ;  commercialization ;  cost of goods ;  good manufacturing practice ;  immunotherapy ;  market adoption ;  price ;  regulation ;  reimbursement ;  scale-up

"The innovation incubator, University business incubator and technology transfer strategy: The case of Thailand","This study reviews the role of the innovation incubator and university business incubator (UBI) in supporting the entrepreneurial development in Thailand. The university business incubator (UBI) is defined in this paper as an incubator set up by the university to provide office space, equipment, mentoring services as well as other administrative supports to assist the formation of new ventures). In particular, the paper compares the operation of the university business incubators (UBIs) and technology incubators to understand their technology transfer strategies. The analyses, based on the Triple Helix model, also include the government policies to support innovation commercialization in Thailand. The study examines case studies of leading university business incubators (UBIs) (Mahidol University, Chulalongkorn University and King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi) and science and technology incubators of the National Science and Technology Agency (NSTDA) and the National Innovation Agency (NIA). The results have shown that the incubation program is one of the major policy mechanisms to support innovation and suggested that UBIs should act as an intermediary between the spheres of university and industry to provide interactive linkages and promote effective utilization of university research. The empirical study provides insightful implications on the move towards the entrepreneurial university and the dynamics of the Triple Helix system in stimulating innovation development and diffusion.",Wonglimpiyarat J.,Journal,Technology in Society,2016-08-01,Thammasat University,Entrepreneurial development ;  Technology commercialization ;  Technology transfer ;  Triple Helix ;  University business incubator (UBI)
Disruptive developments in document recognition,"Progress in optical character recognition, which underlies most applications of document processing, has been driven mainly by technological advances in microprocessors and optical sensor arrays. Software development based on algorithmic innovations appears to be reaching the point of diminishing returns. Research results, dispersed among a dozen venues, tend to lag behind commercial methodology. Some early mainline applications, like reading typescript, patents and law books, have already become obsolete. Check, postal address, and form processing are on their way out. Open source software may open up niche applications that don't generate enough revenue for commercial developers, including poorly-funded transcription of historical documents (especially genealogical records). Smartphone cameras and wearable technologies are engendering new image-based applications, but there is little evidence of widespread adoption. As document contents are integrated into a web-based continuum of data, they are likely losing even the meager individuality of discrete sheets of paper. The persistent need to create, preserve and communicate information is giving rise to entirely new genres of digital documents with a concomitant need for new approaches to document understanding.",Nagy G.,Journal,Pattern Recognition Letters,2016-08-01,Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,Document analysis ;  Forms processing ;  Optical character recognition ;  Semantic web

Innovation learning in comprehensive education?,"The goal of this article is to clarify the concept of innovation and by presenting a research on the basic education outcome assessment data from an innovation learning perspective, answer to a question: Do students learn innovation in comprehensive education? The empirical information in this research is based on data collected in the national assessment of the subject craft, design and technology education (CDT) in Finland in 2010. The comprehensive education in Finland, the basic education, means grades 1–9 in comprehensive schools from age 7 to 16. This assessment included a design task, a test of knowledge and skills and an attitude test in CDT. This research focuses on two central concepts: (1) innovation is defined as a novel, inventive and usable solution, in either material or immaterial space: an end-product, process or method related to people’s practical needs and purposes and (2) innovation learning is defined as a problem based and creative process of using and implementing knowledge and skills in iterative and critical manner in designing and making a novel and practical solution with high usability. The assessment data was marked off to tasks which indicated the innovation learning (n = 661 out of the sample n = 4792). Brim quartiles were used as a methodological solution; the brim quartiles of usability formed the sample of this research. The statistical differences were tested using the Kruskal–Wallis test and the Pearson Chi Square test. Innovation learning includes the process of designing, planning, making and the practical solution itself. The national data allow general conclusions according to the level of innovation learning in comprehensive education. The central observation is that students learn innovation in comprehensive education varying from good to moderate levels. However, if students have not studied design and technology since 7th grade, they are twice as likely to be negative underachievers as to be either positive achievers or positive underachievers. This is useful for governments to know when trying to increase innovation on a national level, as well as when considering the well-being of people and society.",Lindfors E.; Hilmola A.,Journal,International Journal of Technology and Design Education,2016-08-01,Turun yliopisto;Helsingin Yliopisto,Brim quartiles ;  Comprehensive education ;  Design and technology education ;  Innovation ;  Innovation learning ;  Usability
University knowledge and firm innovation: evidence from European countries,"In recent decades, firms have intensified the exploration of external sources of knowledge to enhance their innovation capabilities. This paper presents an empirical analysis of the factors that affect the importance of academic knowledge for firms’ innovation activities. An integrated approach that simultaneously considers country- and firm-level factors is adopted. Regarding the former factors, the analysis shows that the entrepreneurial orientation of university and the quality of academic research increase the importance of knowledge transfers from universities to firms. This suggests that the environmental and institutional context contributes to cross-national disparities in university-industry interactions and the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. In regard to the latter factors, the results indicate that firms oriented toward open search strategies and radical innovations are more likely to draw knowledge from universities. Furthermore, firms belonging to high technology sectors and firms with high absorptive capacity place greater value on the various links with universities. With respect to firm size, the estimates show an inverted U-shaped relation with the importance of universities as a source of knowledge.",Bellucci A.; Pennacchio L.,Journal,Journal of Technology Transfer,2016-08-01,Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II;Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen,Innovation ;  Knowledge transfer ;  Multilevel data ;  University entrepreneurial orientation ;  University-industry links
A systematic test case selection methodology for product lines: results and insights from an industrial case study,"In the context of product lines, test case selection aims at obtaining a set of relevant test cases for a product from the entire set of test cases available for a product line. While working on a research-based innovation project on automated testing of product lines of Video Conferencing Systems (VCSs) developed by Cisco, we felt the need to devise a cost-effective way of selecting relevant test cases for a product. To fulfill such need, we propose a systematic and automated test selection methodology using: 1) Feature Model for Testing (FM_T) to capture commonalities and variabilities of a product line; 2) Component Family Model for Testing (CFM_T) to model the structure of test case repository; 3) A tool to automatically build restrictions from CFM_T to FM_T and traces from CFM_T to the actual test cases. Using our methodology, a test engineer is only required to select relevant features through FM_T at a higher level of abstraction for a product and the corresponding test cases will be obtained automatically. We evaluate our methodology by applying it to a VCS product line called Saturn with seven commercial products and the results show that our methodology can significantly reduce cost measured as test selection time and at the same time achieves higher effectiveness (feature coverage, feature pairwise coverage and fault detection) as compared with the current manual process. Moreover, we conduct a questionnaire-based study to solicit the views of test engineers who are involved in developing FM_T and CFM_T. The results show that test engineers are positive about adapting our methodology in their current practice. Finally, we present a set of lessons learnt while applying product line engineering at Cisco for test case selection.",Wang S.; Ali S.; Gotlieb A.; Liaaen M.,Journal,Empirical Software Engineering,2016-08-01,Cisco Systems;Universitetet i Oslo;Simula Research Laboratory,Component family model ;  Feature model ;  Product line ;  Test case selection
Change management in technology projects: Using a comprehensive model of change management,"Technology projects, including the introduction of new systems such as CRMs and ERPs, have an impact on peoples emotions, perceptions and performance, as well as on organizational and company culture. They also tend to raise a series of management issues that are seldom addressed, causing many technology projects to fail. Technology managers must learn how to manage those changes associated with the introduction of new systems and technical innovations. Change management, a relatively new discipline, offers new perspectives to address the costs and risks associated with change processes. It analyzes critical management issues such as the role of leadership, coordination, process design, and implementation strategies.

"Demystifying the challenges and barriers to manage, develop, and transfer clean and green technologies in Brazilian academic research groups: Some empirical evidence","This work presents empirical evidence of the main challenges in managing/leading academic research groups on clean and green technologies in Brazilian universities. We also present evidence about the main barriers to the effective creation of innovation and technology transfer of these clean and green technologies. Empirical evidence come from PhD researchers/academics who lead/manage official research groups on clean (environmental, green) technologies. Results show the following: (a) The main challenges of managing research groups are the lack of an innovative culture, the lack of partnership with an industrial sector, and the necessity of keeping laboratories updated; (b) the main barriers to innovation and technology transfer are difficulties in not having enough researchers and staff members, assessments of academic performance that do not consider innovation, and an uncertain national legislation on clean technology. Based on these and others’ findings, we suggest that policymakers working on clean and green technologies pay attention to act and develop initiatives focusing on the following: providing direct financial support for laboratory improvement, linking academics and practitioners from the industrial sector, and providing training and development programs on clean and green technologies’ legislation and financial issues, such as the payoff of clean and green technologies and opportunities from green investors.",Jabbour C.; Jabbour A.,Journal,International Journal of Green Energy,2016-07-14,"Universidade Estadual Paulista ""Júlio de Mesquita Filho""",Clean and green technologies ;  emerging economies ;  policymakers ;  research groups ;  research policy
Low carbon technology integration innovation assessment index review based on rough set theory - An evidence from construction industry in China,"An adequate response to global climate change and low carbon economy development has become a worldwide concerned subject. As one of the energetically most intensive industries, construction industry is a key area to promote decarbonization, which is an important path to realize national strategic goals on carbon reduction in China. This paper focuses on low carbon technology integration management, and analyzes the existing research status of green building or low carbon buildings on the related evaluation indexes, then proposes an evaluation system framework for the low carbon technology integration innovation from the perspective of the system management. It points out, that the evaluation of low carbon technology innovation should be conducted by a smarter managing of system resource input, the process control and the system comprehensive performance as an output. Furthermore, based on the questionnaire survey and the exploratory factor analysis result on the selected indexes, this paper implements a rough set method to identify the weight of all the indexes and found that:(1) managers focus more on the affordable input of the beginning stage and the management control in the middle period of the innovation, instead on the output performance in the later stage. This indicates, that the management control during the front stages is more essential than this during the later ones; (2) the constructed evaluation framework, from the system perspective, can properly reflect the integrity, multi-level stakeholder structure and technology integration in low carbon projects, which could support the decision-maker into considering the complexity of construction and evaluation of the technology innovation performance from multi-level perspective; (3) the combined methods, adopted with exploratory factor analysis and rough set evaluation to determine the evaluation index and its weights, could well reflect the overall performance of low carbon project evaluation, the selected indicators have certain scientific and practical effectiveness, which could provide references for enterprise on LCT innovation management. as an industry with a multi-level technologies integration, the single Technological adoption or innovation cannot satisfy the economic transformation requirements of the modern construction industry development. An integration innovation management evaluation model is needed for the sustainability evaluation in the construction practice.

This paper presents the proposed multi-disciplinary approach for this study and one of its main results: the evolution of a document towards a device designed to monitor the field operations (DSAL). In extreme situations where power supplies are lost, the operation of most of the equipment becomes unavailable from the control room. The Field Operators (FO) are a valuable resource yet won't be able to carry out every action required. Those should be prioritized by the team whenever a FO is available. The existing monitoring document has proven to be an inadequate tool to handle this situation and could even induce risks for the installation. A “DSALathon “involving the engineering, operation and research teams was organized to create design a new way of monitoring the field operations.",Cecilia D.; Julia A.; Pierre L.; Emmanuelle G.; Quentin B.,Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2016-07-06,Electricité de France,Agile working ;  Crisis ;  Design innovation ;  Human factors ;  Safety

Data Visualization for Human Rights Advocacy,"In a world of 'Big Data', data visualization allows the viewer to explore curated data; the creator to quickly convey complex information; and advocates to vividly display their view of a better world. Fields as disparate as journalism, environmental advocacy, and development assistance are taking advantage of these data-filled times. A similar movement can be described for the realm of human rights advocacy - although at a much smaller scale. Human rights advocates have been increasingly using data to better understand rights violations and to communicate their findings and messages to targeted audiences, from the general public to policymakers and judicial bodies. While the use of data and visualization among human rights advocates is becoming more common, innovations are being taken up unevenly, and advocates admit that choices about approaches and techniques are largely based on anecdotal evidence. This article introduces the results of preliminary research into some of these questions that are the product of collaboration between researchers from a school of engineering and a school of law. It provides an initial assessment of the field, presenting the results of a study examining the use of data visualization and other visual features by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch through content coding and expert interviews. It then offers the findings of two crowdsourced user studies into pressing questions in the visualization field which hold promise for human rights advocates seeking to communicate their messages through data visualization, and concludes by suggesting further areas for research.",Rall K.; Satterthwaite M.; Pandey A.; Emerson J.; Boy J.; Nov O.; Bertini E.,Journal,Journal of Human Rights Practice,2016-07-01,NYU Law;NYU Tandon School of Engineering;New York University,data visualization ;  human rights advocacy ;  interdisciplinary approaches ;  methodology ;  reporting

An empirical investigation of the perceived benefits of agile methodologies using an innovation-theoretical model,"There is little doubt that agile software development (ASD) methods have gained widespread acceptance in industry. Despite the attention these methods have received, there is little empirical affirmation of the benefits that accrue to those who use agile methodologies. Grounded in the conceptual foundations of innovation diffusion and agile philosophy of development, the authors' study validates a model to assess the perceived advantage of an iterative approach to software development. Consistent with their predictions, the results suggest that evolutionary development - the cornerstone of agile development - is perceived to be less complex and more compatible with the work habits of developers. Further, the findings support the hitherto unsubstantiated claim that iterative development yields benefits to software developers. However, process flexibility, yet another important characteristic of agile development, had no significant impact on complexity, compatibility, and relative advantage. The implications of the study for academics and practitioners, and directions for future research are discussed.",Bonner N.; Kulangara N.; Nerur S.; Teng J.,Journal,Journal of Database Management,2016-07-01,University of Mary Hardin-Baylor;Duquesne University;The University of Texas at Arlington,Agile software development (ASD) ;  Compatibility ;  Complexity ;  Evolutionary development ;  Innovation diffusion theory ;  Process flexibility ;  Process innovation

The power of peripheral innovation: A case study of AmorePacific's cushion foundation,"The locus of innovation can be found in either the core or the peripheral components of a product. Most innovation literature has focused on innovation in core product components because improvements in peripheral components were believed to have only a minor effect on overall innovation or market outcomes. However, AmorePacific's ""cushion,"" a liquid foundation-saturated sponge in a compact, demonstrates that peripheral innovation can create significant competitive advantage: the company's innovative sponges and puffs, peripheral components of its cosmetic products, generated sales revenue of $542 million in 2014. AmorePacific's case suggests a four-step framework for implementing peripheral innovation. First, find customer hassles latent in the core components. Second, address those pain points by improving usability through peripheral components. Third, create synergy between the core and peripheral components. Finally, minimize costs associated with changes to peripheral components.",Lee B.; Kang J.,Journal,Research Technology Management,2016-07-01,Seoul National University;DBR,Peripheral innovation ;  Usability
Team-based development of medical devices: An engineering-business collaborative,"There is a global shift in the teaching methodology of science and engineering toward multidisciplinary, team-based processes. To meet the demands of an evolving technical industry and lead the way in engineering education, innovative curricula are essential. This paper describes the development of multidisciplinary, team-based learning environments in undergraduate and graduate engineering curricula focused on medical device design. In these programs, students actively collaborate with clinicians, professional engineers, business professionals, and their peers to develop innovative solutions to real-world problems. In the undergraduate senior capstone courses, teams of biomedical engineering (BME) and business students have produced and delivered numerous functional prototypes to satisfied clients. Pursuit of commercialization of devices has led to intellectual property (IP) disclosures and patents. Assessments have indicated high levels of success in attainment of student learning outcomes and student satisfaction with their undergraduate design experience. To advance these projects toward commercialization and further promote innovative team-based learning, a Master of Engineering (MEng) in Design and Commercialization was recently launched. The MEng facilitates teams of graduate students in engineering, life sciences, and business who engage in innovation-commercialization (IC) projects and coursework that take innovative ideas through research and development (R&D) to create marketable devices. The activities are structured with students working together as a ""virtual company,"" with targeted outcomes of commercialization (license agreements and new start-ups), competitive job placement, and/or career advancement.",Eberhardt A.; Johnson O.; Kirkland W.; Dobbs J.; Moradi L.,Journal,Journal of Biomechanical Engineering,2016-07-01,Department of Biomedical Engineering;University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Engineering;University of Alabama at Birmingham Collat School of Business;The University of Alabama at Birmingham,business ;  design ;  engineering education ;  innovation ;  multidisciplinary ;  team-based learning

Dry powder inhalable formulations for anti-tubercular therapy,"Tuberculosis (TB) is an intracellular infectious disease caused by the airborne bacterium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Despite considerable research efforts, the treatment of TB continues to be a great challenge in part due to the requirement of prolonged therapy with multiple high-dose drugs and associated side effects. The delivery of pharmacological agents directly to the respiratory system, following the natural route of infection, represents a logical therapeutic approach for treatment or vaccination against TB. Pulmonary delivery is non-invasive, avoids first-pass metabolism in the liver and enables targeting of therapeutic agents to the infection site. Inhaled delivery also potentially reduces the dose requirement and the accompanying side effects. Dry powder is a stable formulation of drug that can be stored without refrigeration compared to liquids and suspensions. The dry powder inhalers are easy to use and suitable for high-dose formulations. This review focuses on the current innovations of inhalable dry powder formulations of drug and vaccine delivery for TB, including the powder production method, preclinical and clinical evaluations of inhaled dry powder over the last decade. Finally, the risks associated with pulmonary therapy are addressed. A novel dry powder formulation with high percentages of respirable particles coupled with a cost effective inhaler device is an appealing platform for TB drug delivery.",Parumasivam T.; Chang R.; Abdelghany S.; Ye T.; Britton W.; Chan H.,Journal,Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews,2016-07-01,The University of Sydney School of Medicine;The University of Jordan;The University of Sydney,Antibiotics ;  Dry powder inhaler ;  Inhaled risks ;  Particle engineering ;  Pulmonary formulations ;  Tuberculosis ;  Vaccines
Managing innovation in the bioeconomy: An open innovation perspective,"The transition towards a bioeconomy is increasingly viewed by both policy makers and scholars as one of the primary ways to reduce our dependency on fossil resources. However, socio-economic research on the transition towards the bioeconomy at the firm-level remains scarce. Specifically, studies approaching the bioeconomy from the technology and innovation management (TIM) concepts are particularly uncommon, although the importance of knowledge generation and innovation is considered crucial to make the transition towards a greener economy. In this study, we take a first step in addressing this issue by developing a set of guiding principles for the management of innovation processes in the bioeconomy comprised in three key issues: the relevant stakeholder groups and their importance in innovation development within the bioeconomy, the innovation network strategy and management, and organizational features considered prerequisites for collaborative innovation. This called for an identification of influencing factors specific to the bioeconomy context and the establishment of basic characteristics of innovation processes in the bioeconomy. The five identified influencing factors, the basic innovation process characteristics, and the guidelines and recommendations presented in this paper are based on insights derived from a four-staged literature research of the bioeconomy and TIM literature. In particular, we focused on the Open Innovation approach because of the evident fit between this approach and the requirements for innovation in the bioeconomy.",Van Lancker J.; Wauters E.; Van Huylenbroeck G.,Journal,Biomass and Bioenergy,2016-07-01,Instituut voor Landbouw- en Visserijonderzoek;Universiteit Gent;Universiteit Antwerpen,Biobased economy ;  Collaborative innovation ;  Knowledge-based bioeconomy ;  Open innovation ;  Radical innovation ;  Technology development
Managing the innovators: Organizational and professional commitment among scientists and engineers,"How can leaders best manage commitment among innovators? We applied theory on dual allegiance to multiple targets of commitment, in conjunction with person-organization fit theory, to explore the dynamics of organizational and professional commitment among scientists and engineers working in hybrid, research-focused organizations. These types of organizations are founded on large-scale multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional collaboration between academe and industry. Using both individual- and organizational-level variables collected from 255 academic science and engineering researchers working in 22 National Science Foundation-funded Engineering Research Centers, our analyses revealed that researcher innovation orientation (i.e., the predisposition to approach work in novel ways) was positively associated with organizational and professional commitment. Those relationships were moderated by two factors: organizational productivity in late-stage technology transfer and the researcher's perceived role significance (i.e., in fulfilling the strategic mission of the organization). The strongest positive relationship between innovation orientation and organizational commitment emerged among researchers who perceived high role significance and worked in highly productive organizations. A negative relationship between innovation orientation and professional commitment also emerged among those individuals. Post-hoc analyses revealed that highly innovative, senior researchers who perceived high role significance were the most likely to report higher levels of both organizational and professional commitment. Leaders of multi-disciplinary research centers who are aware of the complexity of dynamics among organizational commitment, professional commitment, and role significance may be better equipped to effectively manage science and engineering researchers.",Perry S.; Hunter E.; Currall S.,Journal,Research Policy,2016-07-01,Hankamer School of Business;Southern Methodist University,Innovation orientation ;  Multi-Institutional Multi-Disciplinary University Research Centers ;  Organizational commitment ;  Professional commitment ;  Role significance ;  Technology transfer

3D culture for cardiac cells,"This review discusses historicalmilestones, recent developments and challenges in the area of 3D culturemodels with cardiovascular cell types. Expectations in this area have been raised in recent years, but more relevant in vitro research, more accurate drug testing results, reliable disease models and insights leading to bioartificial organs are expected from the transition to 3D cell culture. However, the construction of organ-like cardiac 3D models currently remains a difficult challenge. The heart consists of highly differentiated cells in an intricate arrangement. Furthermore, electrical ""wiring"", a vascular systemandmultiple cell types act in concert to respond to the rapidly changing demands of the body. Although cardiovascular 3D culture models have been predominantly developed for regenerative medicine in the past, their use in drug screening and for disease models has become more popular recently. Many sophisticated 3D culture models are currently being developed in this dynamic area of life science.

Linking Models and Experiments,"This position paper gives an overview of the discussion that took place at FIPSE 2 at Aldemar Resort, east of Heraklion, Crete, in June 21-23, 2014. This is the second conference in the series ""Future Innovation in Process Systems Engineering"" (http://fi-in-pse.org), which takes place every other year in Greece, with the objective to discuss open research challenges in three topics in Process Systems Engineering. One of the topics of FIPSE 2 was the issue of ""Linking Models and Experiments"", which is described in this publication. Process models have been used extensively in academia and industry for several decades. Yet, this paper argues that there are still substantial challenges to be addressed along the lines of model structure selection, identifiability, experiment design, nonlinear parameter estimation, model validation, model improvement, online model adaptation, model portability, modeling of complex systems, numerical methods, software environments, and implementation aspects. Although there has been an exponential increase in the number of publications dealing with ""modeling"", the majority of these publications do not use sound statistical tools to evaluate the model quality and accuracy and also present modeling as a noniterative task. As a result, the models often have either too few or too many parameters, thus requiring trimming down or enhancing before they can be used appropriately. Also, this position paper argues that the models should be developed with a purpose in mind, as, for example, different models are needed for design, control, monitoring, and optimization.",Bonvin D.; Georgakis C.; Pantelides C.; Barolo M.; Grover M.; Rodrigues D.; Schneider R.; Dochain D.,Journal,Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research,2016-06-29,Process Systems Enterprise Limited;École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne;Tufts University;Georgia Institute of Technology;Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen;Université Catholique de Louvain;Università degli Studi di Padova,

Engineering software using automation,"Gedae has developed automated software engineering technology for computers and software. This paper presents the research, prototypes, and documented software engineering improvements from real-world case studies that led to the Gedae technology. Gedae's technology is based on the creation and analysis of software models, specifically dataflow software models. The dataflow software model is implemented using the Gedae Dataflow Language. Some of the most important concepts we employ are drawn from historical dataflow literature and other dataflow efforts such as Signal Processing Graph Network (SPGN) and Ptolemy (UC-Berkeley). The language evolved to fit customer needs in reduced memory footprint and overhead and to enable them to specify concepts difficult to express with basic dataflow. As a result, the language now includes over 50 modifiers that are not part of traditional dataflow languages. For example, while developing language support for modal software (or multitasking), a customer required memory sharing between modes to meet their embedded memory requirements. This need led to the development of the language modifier exclusive which specifies only one mode executes at a time. The benefit of this innovation is that it allows the compiler to optimally share memory between modes. The structure of Gedae and how it creates and uses the software model is shown in figure 1. The structure was devised and developed to fit customers' needs of portability, productivity, and maintainability without adding the overhead of complex software layers. The Idea Language is a high-level language similar to MATLAB script. Gedae's Idea Builder™ converts the code into the dataflow software model. The Gedae Core Technologies analyze the purely functional software model and modify it to match the hardware model. Gedae's Auto Builder™ converts the resulting software model into code for each processor/core, compiles and links it using historical (C) programming tools. The focus of the research behind the compiler is to work with customers as they develop complex programs using the language, and based on their prototypes, drive to simplify the language and move complexity from the language to the compiler's Core Technologies. The Gedae Core Technologies implement the automated software engineering concepts to: 1) modify the dataflow software model to match the hardware target 2) decompose the application into threads 3) schedule kernels for execution within the threads 4) plan memory use within the threads 5) plan the sharing of memory among the threads, and 6) implement thread control within the application to control the dynamic execution and memory plan. This paper is an overview of the concepts behind these core technologies, the Gedae Dataflow Language and how it enables these technologies, and the research, trials and errors, and customer needs that led to the creation of this technology foundation.",Lundgren W.; Steed J.; Barnes K.,Conference Proceeding,IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings,2016-06-27,"Gedae, Inc.",
"Spacecraft obsolescence: Modeling, value analysis, and implications for design and acquisition","Obsolescence is a distinctive state of both (physical) products and information, and it is commonly defined as the condition of being outdated or no longer useful. For the U.S Department of Defense (DoD), obsolescence is a serious matter that affects a host of military systems, by making it challenging to procure specific parts needed to build or repair them. For commercial engineering systems, obsolescence is an important determinant of the loss of competitive edge or advantage. System obsolescence is in part due to the tension between the increasingly longer design lifetimes of systems on the one hand, and the shorter life cycles of the underlying technologies embedded in the systems on the other hand. Faster changes in market needs and expectations are also important drivers of system obsolescence. As such, obsolescence and technology innovation are dual concepts that mirror each other in an inverse or negative relationship. In this work, we investigate two related issues: the notion of system obsolescence in general, and its particular manifestation in the case of spacecraft. Our objective is to contribute to a better understanding of this phenomenon and its consequences in general, and of spacecraft obsolescence in particular. This understanding is a necessary first step for better managing and mitigating the risk of obsolescence. To this effect, we first provide a multidisciplinary literature review of obsolescence, from economics to operations research. We then examine obsolescence as it pertains to engineering items and its relationship to product lifecycle. Since we are concerned in this work with system obsolescence instead of component obsolescence, we do not examine cohort effects such as sales volume of a given item, as is traditionally done in the literature on the subject. Instead, we focus on the value generated by a single system, and we connect obsolescence with the loss of remaining system value. We argue that obsolescence decreases the value delivery profile of a system over time, and we develop the analytics to support and illustrate this proposition. We adapt our obsolescence model to spacecraft and examine various consequences of the onset and intensity of obsolescence on the spacecraft value. We provide several recommendations based on our findings. We introduce an obsolescence map as a visualization tool to help rank different payloads for which obsolescence mitigation ought to be prioritized. We make the case that the time to peak of the net value of a system, given its exposure to obsolescence, ought to be an important consideration when selecting an optimal design lifetime for the system. We also suggest that the value implications of system obsolescence can serve as a valuation standard for obsolescence mitigation strategies and provide an upper bound on the willingness-to-pay for their implementations (e.g., flexible payloads).",Geng F.; Dubos G.; Saleh J.,Conference Proceeding,IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings,2016-06-27,College of Engineering,NPV ;  obsolescence ;  spacecraft ;  value analysis ;  value penalty
Team negotiation strategies in entrepreneurship education: Patterns found in engineering students from Northern California and Santiago de Chile,"A new way of doing engineering is rising. Particularly, accreditation criteria and local demands are requiring schools of engineering to transform engineering education by embracing entrepreneurship and innovation. Students need to be more prepared to address challenges of the industry through effective engineering design process. Nonetheless, we expect teams of students to be able to overcome friction in any entrepreneurial endeavor with little or no instruction on how to work and orchestrate dissonance. This paper showcases context sensitive qualitative information from a team negotiation study conducted in two educational settings in North and South America. We describe two bottom-up negotiation strategies that become a shared pattern between the two research sites. Additionally, both group of students described a new mindset for doing things and solving real problems. Being comfortable with ambiguity is an emergent expected outcome from a new way of teaching and learning engineering. A convergence in the negotiation patterns is expected from collecting information in other research sites. The techniques are visual in nature and have the potential to be transferrable as concrete tools for a universal framework for any engineering design curriculum.",Mendoza C.; Hilliger I.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile,
"A multivariate examination of active and interactive learning and student engagement in post-secondary engineering energy science classrooms: The ""why"" of instructional strategy use","Recent national STEM initiatives have shifted research focus from the development of instructional innovations to the examination of change processes and implementation of research based instructional strategies. Emphasis has been placed on adoption of instructional strategies and how they are implemented, especially in engineering science courses at the core of engineering curriculum. Unfortunately, little has been done to examine the multivariate relationship among instructional strategies, active and interactive learning, and student engagement in post-secondary engineering energy science courses. Successful implementation of instructional strategies hinges not only on the how, but also the why and for what purpose. The current study provides evidence for the complex, multivariate relationship among eight instructional strategies, active and interactive learning, and multiple forms of student engagement in post-secondary engineering energy science courses. Results have implications for the specific use of instructional strategies to promote different forms of engagement and learning.",Hilpert J.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,Georgia Southern University,

"NSF S-STEM scholarship program initiative via recruitment, innovation, and transformation: SPIRIT program year-one results","The NSF S-STEM funded SPIRIT: Scholarship Program Initiative via Recruitment, Innovation, and Transformation program at Western Carolina University creates a new approach to the recruitment, retention, education, and placement of academically talented and financially needy engineering and engineering technology students. Twenty-seven new and continuing students were recruited into interdisciplinary cohorts that are being nurtured and developed in a community characterized by extensive peer and faculty mentoring, vertically integrated Project Based Learning (PBL), and undergraduate research experiences. The SPIRIT Scholar program attracted a diverse group of Engineering and Engineering Technology students, thus increasing the percentage of female and minority student participation as compared to the host department program demographics. Over the last academic year, fifty-four undergraduate research projects/activities were conducted by the twenty-seven scholars under the direction of twelve faculty fellows. Additionally, peer-to-peer mentorship and student leadership were developed through the program's vertically integrated PBL model, which incorporated four courses and seven small-group design projects. Academic and professional support for the student scholars were administered through collaborations with several offices at the host institution, including an industry-engaged product development center. The program participants reported strong benefits from engaging in the program activities during the first year. Specifically, this paper presents results from the program activities, including: cohort recruitment and demographics; support services; undergraduate research; vertically integrated PBL activities; and the external review of the program.

The interface between cognitive science and innovation,"This paper began by presenting the construct of innovation and technological innovation and then overviewing cognitive and two of its central concepts: metacognition and motivation. Although a considerable amount of literature pertaining to these topics was referenced, the conclusion stated in the author s 2015 SEFI conference paper, still holds, i.e., that there remains a need to better understand the process of ideation and that the discipline of cognitive science offered much potential for research leading to improved understanding of innovation. Subsequently, and with reference to engineering and technology education the potential of employing the perspectives and methodologies of cognitive science was posited and at least some of the implications thereof were highlighted by generating a set of questions with potential to yield fruitful results. Much work, however, remains to further explore and detail the latter.",Dyrenfurth M.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,Purdue Polytechnic Institute,Cognitive science ;  Engineering education ;  Innovation ;  Research ;  Technology education
Entrepreneurship education for women in engineering: A systematic review of entrepreneurship assessment literature with a focus on gender,"The nation's economic vitality and global competitiveness depends on the creativity and innovation of its citizenship. While institutions of higher education nationwide are being pressured to train and produce a highly skilled technical workforce, engineering schools are especially challenged with preparing their students to anticipate societal needs and translate their technical expertise into commercializable solutions. In response to this challenge, engineering schools have begun incorporating entrepreneurship education programs within their curriculums. Regardless of differences in size, scope, and student participation, generally, these programs are intended to provide students with fundamental business skills and foster an entrepreneurial mindset1. While research has shown that entrepreneurship education programs do increase science and engineering students' entrepreneurial intent2, potential differences in outcomes based on gender were not examined. Additionally, what is occurring within entrepreneurship education environments that might be influencing women's entrepreneurial outcomes and experiences? Curious about how gender has been addressed in entrepreneurship education scholarship with respect to assessment, a systematic literature review of entrepreneurship education research, to date, as found in two databases that cover engineering, business, and education literature and extracted articles that specifically focus on gender was conducted. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, the search yielded 24 articles for this review. In addition to synthesizing current entrepreneurship education assessment research with an emphasis on gender, this review also provides recommendations for engineering education researchers who desire to examine how entrepreneurship education environments influence women. The purpose of this review is to guide future research on engineering entrepreneurship through a gendered lens. Further, this review serves to inform the development or improvement of existing engineering entrepreneurship education programs that seek to attract and retain more women.",Morton C.; Huang-Saad A.; Libarkin J.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,"Michigan State University;University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",
Evaluation of an energy and engineering outreach program for high school and middle school students,"The education and influence of students in the STEM fields has great importance in modern society, especially with our ever-increasing reliance on new technologies. Research collaboration between two universities engaged over 700 students and teachers. The authors designed engineering-based curriculum, hands-on lessons, and demonstrations that were focused on energy. The curriculum exposed students and teachers to fundamental science and engineering concepts. Many of the activities for these outreach activities engaged participants in a 3-tiered energy challenge by designing and fabricating prototypes that demonstrate: (1) Energy generation and conversion, (2) Increased energy efficiency, and (3) Energy use monitoring and control. The design and physical modeling that was employed in the outreach events using energy technologies requires students and teachers to practice high-level thinking (e.g. analysis, synthesis, evaluation) in teams while building a culture geared toward energy technology innovation. The participants were introduced to concepts from traditional engineering curricula such as thermodynamics, fluid mechanics and dynamics, while working with principles of renewable and nonrenewable energy technologies used in industry, such as the photovoltaic effect. The student participants were given pre-tests and post-tests to evaluate the success of the outreach events in developing their awareness and understanding of energy and engineering, measure their level of engagement with the activities, and evaluate their attitudes towards teamwork. This paper will present the energy curriculum, hands-on energy laboratories, design and fabrication challenge and the results from the pre- and post-tests.",Kerzmann T.; Walker J.; Sanchez D.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,Swanson School of Engineering;Robert Morris University,
Understanding how a culture of collaboration develops among STEM faculty,"Many stakeholders have called for education reform and particularly regarding the outdated manner in which we generally educate engineers. As a result, understanding dissemination and implementation tactics of research-based instructional strategies (RBIS) has emerged as a critical topic within engineering education research. Additionally funding agencies such as the NSF, have encouraged interdisciplinary projects where STEM faculty work with education experts to apply innovations in teaching. However, how to make these joint ventures successful is less well understood. For example, collaboration in engineering education research typically focuses on student teams or how professional engineering teams learn to work together. Fewer studies articulate how to motivate engineering faculty to interact across engineering disciplines, let alone, with non-engineering faculty such as educational experts. Therefore, the research team sought to understand, how can we develop a culture of collaboration among STEM faculty around the issue of implementing teaching innovation including RBIS's? The specific guiding research question for the current study is how do faculty in STEM describe their experience participating in the Strategic Instructional Innovations Program (SIIP) - a program designed to promote and support the implementation of teaching innovation? This qualitative study employs an exploratory phenomenological approach, using semistructured interviews with 12 STEM faculty across academic ranks. The participants worked on a collaborative team project(s) to implement teaching innovations at a Midwestern large researchintensive, predominantly white institution (PWI). The project durations ranged from one to three years for sustainable implementation of teaching innovations. The semi-structured interviews covered the participant's previous teaching experience prior to joining the SIIP community, a description of their current role in the community including what did and did not work well, and a description of their vision for the community in the future. Consistent with phenomenological research, the interviews were evaluated holistically to allow essential themes of the experience to emerge. Preliminary results of the phenomenological analysis suggest three emergent themes. First, the participants specified the entry point for implementing instructional innovation. That is to say, the departmental culture was emphasized as a key structural support to ensure the sustainability of the implemented innovation. The second emergent theme articulated by the participants, was the recognition of individual skills and abilities within the SIIP community. Specifically, the expanded peer interaction fostered an environment for complimentary skills to thrive. For example, some of the STEM faculty were more comfortable than others with flipping their classroom, particularly with large service courses with over 100 students, and were able to share best practices or personal success stories. Finally, most participants acknowledge a significant shift in their appreciation for teaching and learning including the scholarship of teaching. In conclusion these combined emergent themes suggest that faculty in STEM require structural and social support such as a community of practice to engage in activities to successfully establish a culture of collaboration when implementing instructional innovation.",Cross K.; Mamaril N.; Johnson N.; Herman G.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,The Grainger College of Engineering,
Developing an interactive computer program to enhance student learning of dynamical systems,"Today's students are quite accustomed to availing themselves of the latest in computer innovations and technology to aid in learning and the attainment of student outcomes. For example, use of tablets and cellphones in the classroom to take notes, collaborate on projects and to search the web for information is commonplace. Likewise, advancements in computer software and tools afford in-depth simulations of both mechanical and thermal systems. MATHEMATICA, with its symbolic and visual capabilities, is one such tool that, despite its robustness, has seen little utilization in the classroom environment, yet it is viewed as a tool for those who pursue research in every discipline from economics to engineering. In this paper, the capabilities of MATHEMATICA are explored as a tool to model and visualize the forced mechanical response of viscoelastically-damped, multiple degree of freedoms systems obtained through a Newtonian approach. Proportional damping permits the resulting Eigen-value problem to be diagonalized using a Cholesky Decomposition method. In addition, multiple harmonics can be included as part of the forcing function. Displacement results for each mass permit the generation of graphical results and also provide the needed inputs for animated motions of all included masses. While the ultimate goal is to solve the dynamic response of general nth degree of freedom systems, explicit results are presented for the second, fourth, and tenth order degree of freedom system to demonstrate the efficiency of the software. All results are demonstrated in an interactive, user friendly program developed explicitly for this purpose.",Howe D.; Barton O.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,College of Engineering and Computing,
"Exploring innovation, psychological safety, communication, and knowledge application in a multidisciplinary capstone design course","In recent years, engineering schools have been inspired by accreditation bodies to incorporate multidisciplinary teaming in their curricula, and hence engineering schools have started to offer multidisciplinary capstone design courses. These courses give senior engineering students industry/client based projects in order to prepare them for today's diverse educational and professional work place. In contrast to monodisciplinary capstones, multidisciplinary capstones create a diverse team of students from different engineering disciplines to design, build, and test proof of concepts for an industry based project. There is limited quantitative and qualitative research about multidisciplinary capstone's performance. Hence to provide insight on multidisciplinary capstone's performance, we explored the relationship between innovation (at the individual level and at the team level), psychological safety, knowledge transfer (application of one's knowledge), and feedback from teammates, supervisors, and clients in a multidisciplinary engineering capstone course. We also investigated barriers that multidisciplinary capstone teams encountered to be innovative by observing the teams' psychological safety behaviors. We hypothesised that multidisciplinary teams are likely to produce innovative solutions due to their functional diversity. However, functional diversity can also lead to conflict. According to literature, multidisciplinary teams have low psychological safety score because of their diversity. Low psychological safety affects team's collaborative learning and efficiency. We investigated these factors and relationships in multidisciplinary capstone. A mix of quantitative and qualitative methods were used in this study. We did an online survey with a 55% response rate. Moreover, we conducted 11 one-on-one interviews with students over a course of one year. Our questionnaire included a set of questions on innovation, psychological safety, knowledge use and transfer, and feedback. We examined our data to find relationships between these variables that can help us understand the dynamics of innovation in a multidisciplinary capstone course. We found correlations between the psychological safety score of teams and their collaborative learning and team efficiency. We also found that team innovation has a particularly strong correlation with psychological safety and is also significantly correlated with teammate's feedback score. Our research shows that multidisciplinary students are very innovative due to their knowledge diversity. However, there are certain barriers regarding the knowledge transfer, communication, and psychological safety that can be addressed during the development of such a course. Our research provides data-driven insights for development of an effective multidisciplinary capstone design course. We found statistics that support the idea that feedback, knowledge transfer, psychological safety, and the multidisciplinary nature of capstone are positively correlated to innovation at the team level and/or at the individual level. We also found that psychological safety of the team has a strong correlation with innovation. Our results show that low psychological safety appears to inhibit innovative behaviors and high psychological safety appears to encourage innovation.",Balouchestani-Asli N.; Greenacre M.; Behdinan K.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry;University of Toronto,
Implementing and assessing a joint REU/RET program in materials science,"In this paper we describe a joint Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) and Research Experience for Teachers (RET) program focused on energy and sustainability topics within a Materials Science and Engineering program at a public university. This program brought ten undergraduate science and engineering students and five local middle and high school teachers on campus for an 8-week research experiences working with different lab groups. Given the relatively small number of participants, we chose qualitative interviews as our primary source of data for assessing the effectiveness of this program. The participants identified numerous positive aspects of participating in the summer research program. Students appreciated the sense of community they developed with both the other participants in the research program and the other members of their lab groups. Although most of the participants did not report the summer research experience as having a strong influence on their decisions to pursue graduate school or careers involving research, they did report both being more confident in their ability to be successful as a researcher and appreciating the opportunity to learn more about the practice of engineering research in an academic setting. For the teachers involved in the program we describe how participation influenced their leadership, perceptions of adoption educational innovations, and willingness to provide more opportunities to engage their students in authentic STEM research. The participants also provided several recommendations for improvement to the summer research program. For the students, these included more materials in advance and a more streamlined onboarding process to allow them to get up to speed on their projects more quickly, consistent access to their supervisors, and work that is intellectually challenging. Suggestion from the teacher participants for improvement mostly involved requests for more guidance on how to incorporate what they were learning in their research into lessons for their classrooms. By describing this program and the successes and challenges encountered by the participants and organizers, we intend to help others considering implementing REU/RET programs or other summer research experiences to design and implement successful programs.",Salzman N.; Nadelson L.; Ubic R.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,Utah State University;Boise State University,
Research on innovation and creativity in higher education in engineering and science for Community Colleges: Student strengths and challenges,"There is a critical need for more students with engineering and science majors to enter into, persist, and graduate from postsecondary institutions. Increasing the diversity in engineering and science is also a profound identified need. According to national statistics, the largest groups of underrepresented minority students in engineering and science attend United States public higher education institutions and in particular the community colleges. Recent research has indicated that students from these populations who are strong problem solvers, and who understand how to seek assistance and navigate college campuses, are most likely persist to degree completion. Accordingly, this research seeks to examine a sample of non-traditional college students enrolled in science and engineering programs in four urban community colleges to determine (a) the types and frequency of support practices they utilize, (b) how such practices influence their achievement, persistence and transfer status to four year colleges and universities, and (c) how in turn their propensity for innovation and creative problem solving affects such choices and persistence. The study analyzes the pedagogical practices-practices designed to foster successful transfer from community college to four-year colleges and universities and how students' innovative capability influences such transfer capacity. The goals are: (1) to explore the pedagogical practices used to support non-traditional students in community colleges to inform persistence, (2) to understand whether such practices are effective in offering non-traditional students a program that enables them to stay in engineering and science majors and to transfer to a four year college or university, and (3) to determine if students' propensity for innovative problem solving influences use of pedagogical practices and ultimately, transfer persistence. The research targets five research questions: (1) What are the patterns of pedagogical practices that community colleges employ to enhance students' transfer success in engineering and science? (2) Are there discernable profiles of non-traditional students enrolling in engineering and science majors in community colleges that utilize these pedagogical practices? (3) How do students' creative and innovative problem solving approaches influence the choices that they make in using pedagogical support practices? (4) What are the impacts of pedagogical practices and differences among pedagogical practices, on persistence toward students' transfer to colleges and universities? (5) How do students' creative and innovative problem solving approaches influence their persistence toward transfer to engineering and science programs at 4-year universities? This research studies an area and group of students that have been historically understudied, community college students in engineering and science. It builds upon the researchers' current studies of STEM pathways and students' propensity for innovation, both of which are research areas recognized as areas that engineering education must cultivate in students. The research also provides rigorous empirical research on students who have been traditionally underrepresented in higher education research, thereby advancing the knowledge to higher education research communities.",Ragusa G.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,University of Southern California,
Catalyzing active learning: Implementing active learning across an engineering and science college,"A cohort model was implemented in a college of engineering and science at the University of Minnesota Duluth (UMD) after initiating a strategic development plan to create cultural and pedagogical change in undergraduate classrooms to engaged and active learning environments. The initial cohort consisted of faculty from Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, Computer Science, Civil Engineering, Mathematics, Mechanical Engineering, the Dean of the College of Science and Engineering (SCSE) and a facilitator from the University of Minnesota's Center for Educational Innovation (CEI). The cohort meetings began in January with focus on theory of learning and best practice of teaching using active learning strategies. The foundational readings and facilitated discussion were developed around the book How Learning Works, by Ambrose et al. Practical integration of current research and practice of active learning into undergraduate classrooms was followed by continued work in the summer months to redesign a course for fall semester incorporating active learning strategies. During the fall implementation, the cohort continued to meet to talk about experiences in their courses and to plan workshops and dissemination of outcomes/uses of active learning to all faculty in SCSE. At the end of fall semester, the cohort model solicitation was sent to the entire faculty in SCSE, with new cohorts starting in spring semester. The second year of the model is currently in progress with 38 participants from the faculty selected to populate six small multidisciplinary cohorts. The initial faculty cohort team comprises five of the six facilitators of the new cohorts. Moreover, all seven members of the initial faculty cohort continue to meet. This community of practice is leading the development of additional workshops, implementation of an assessment/evaluation framework to document the effect of active learning as this continues and expands through SCSE, writing grant proposals to enable further dissemination of the multidisciplinary cohort model approach across a college of engineering and science, and supporting each other's individual research endeavors.",Bibelnieks T.; Gorman K.; Gute B.; Hamilton J.; Hill E.; Hoxie A.; Saftner D.; Schokker A.; Willemsen P.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,University of Minnesota Duluth,
Cross-disciplinary collaboration and innovation for engineering and business student teams,"A team was formed from students across campus including majors from business entrepreneurship, management, marketing, and electrical, civil, mechanical, and mechatronic engineering to compete in the U.S. Department of Energy Collegiate Wind Competition 2016. Requirements of the competition are to deliver a market-driven technology application, create an innovative business plan, and develop a deployment strategy. Two faculty advisers, a mechanical engineering assistant professor from the college of engineering and an entrepreneurship assistant professor from the college of business designed and delivered content to help student members effectively collaborate and innovate across their disciplines and form a cohesive and high functioning team. In addition to being members of the cross-disciplinary team, half the students were concurrently enrolled in a business management course with an emphasis in social entrepreneurship and market analysis while another half were enrolled in a senior capstone engineering course. Activities in the form of workshops were delivered to the team during weekly meetings to develop and enhance skills in team development, communications, project management, business development, brainstorming, and ideation. In addition, engineering students collaborated with business students during the business management course to provide technical expertise during market research and analysis and students presented to one another on topics related to their particular disciplines.

From entrepreneur to designer: The transferable design principles of the entrepreneur,"The competencies and outcomes of entrepreneurial activities spark the interest of many stakeholders across innovation ecosystems - governments, companies, entrepreneurs, and educational institutions alike. Typically, those of an entrepreneurial bent are sought after for their ability to create new ventures and deliver multiple forms of societal value, such as creating jobs, bolstering the economy, and translating technology into real world applications. Yet, beyond these outcomes, at the core of entrepreneurial activities is a qualitatively distinct design approach; and thus an entrepreneurial mindset has the potential to be a powerful philosophy to scaffold thinking and solve problems in any domain. However, very little has been explicitly written about how this mindset and problem-solving philosophy could map to domains in which new ventures are not a desired outcome. This paper focuses on synthesizing and distilling the design and problem-solving strategies of the entrepreneur to make them broadly applicable beyond business centric contexts. The paper reviews multiple literature streams in entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial expertise, effectuation, entrepreneurial firm design, and entrepreneurial opportunity recognition, problem-solving and decision-making using Boyer's scholarship of integration lens as a guiding approach. This approach places value on integrating insights into new language that unifies concepts often dispersed across domains. Emphasis is placed on the design (problem solving) principles of entrepreneurs and their applicability across contexts, synthesizing such principles in a proposed framework of entrepreneurship as a problem-solving philosophy. Overall, the paper complements current research streams in entrepreneurship by helping further characterize the entrepreneurial method, while simultaneously opening new research and teaching directions, thus enriching the engineering education space and related fields.",Solis F.; Sinfield J.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,Purdue University,
Expert study of engineers solving ill-defined biotransport problems: Findings to influence development of student innovation,"This study compares engineering expert problem-solving on a highly constrained routine problem and an ill-defined complex problem. The participants (n=7) were recruited from two large public Research I institutions. Using a think aloud methodology, the experts solved both routine and non-routine problems. The protocols were transcribed and coded in Atlas ti. The first round of coding followed a grounded theory methodology, yielding interesting findings. Unprompted, the experts revealed a strong belief that the ill-defined problems are developmentally appropriate for PhD students while routine problems are more appropriate for undergraduate students. Additional rounds of coding were informed by previous problem solving studies in math and engineering. In general, this study confirmed the 5 Step Problem Solving Method used in previous challenged based instruction studies. There were observed differences based on problem type and background knowledge. The routine problem was more automatic and took significantly less time. The experts with higher amounts of background knowledge and experience were more likely to categorize the problems. The level of background knowledge was most apparent in the steps between conducting an overall energy balance and writing more problem specific relationships between the variables.

Students as change agents: Leveraging students to infuse innovation & entrepreneurship into the campus ecosystem,"Engineering students have many opportunities to engage in existing co-curricular activities such as robotics clubs and Engineers Without Borders but have fewer chances to create participate and entrepreneurship (I&E) activities. Changing the culture and structures of a campus to provide curricular, co-curricular, and informal opportunities to engage in I&E requires a systemic approach. Engineering students are often an untapped resource for making such a campus-based change. Epicenter, an NSF Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Talent Expansion Program (STEP) center, operates with the mission of empowering US undergraduate engineering students to bring their ideas to life for the benefit of our economy and society. Epicenter conducts research, works with faculty, and through the University Innovation Fellows (UIF) program, has generated a student-led grassroots method for infusing I&E into the university ecosystem. As of February 2016, over 600 undergraduates from 143 institutions have gone through the UIF training. These student participants, known as ""Fellows,"" acquire knowledge of tools, frameworks, program models, and leadership skills to help them develop an entrepreneurial mindset and creative confidence. These skills are systematically applied as they work with students, faculty, and other stakeholders to expand the campus ecosystem for innovation and entrepreneurship. Fellows organize events, develop and secure physical space, contribute to course development, and engage administrators. Many of the Fellows go on to influence the national conversation on I&E by organizing regional events and participating in forums that present at national conferences, such as ASEE, and White House STEM initiatives. The purpose of this study is to explore how to evaluate a student change program in which both students and an institution are effected. Annual surveys suggest both Fellows and their Faculty Sponsors find students to be an effective resource for making campus-based change. Questions this paper will explore include: • How can a student training program define success at the individual and institutional level? • What personal, programmatic, and contextual factors correlate with success?• What is the value to faculty of students as change agents for expanding the I&E ecosystem on a campus?",Zarch R.; Peterfreund A.; Cavagnaro L.; Fasihuddin H.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,Stanford Engineering;University Innovation Fellows (UIF) Program;SageFox Consulting Group,
"Going beyond ""What should we do?"": An approach to implementation of innovation and entrepreneurship in the curriculum","In the engineering disciplines, ""agile"" approaches are most often associated with product development, particularly in the software arena. The approach is most useful for addressing challenges that are complex, require many people, and in which there is a high degree of uncertainty about the best approach.1 This set of conditions holds true far beyond product development. One such scenario is that of planning and implementation of organizational interventions - an environment in which ""strategic planning"" is often the tool of choice but one which is ineffective in a networked (rather than hierarchical) context. An alternative approach described in this paper is ""strategic doing"". As in agile product development, the approach uses iterative cycles of implementation, learning and reflection, and improvement, with a focus on rapid experimentation and gradual scaling up of solutions. While not designed for educational settings, the use of strategic doing in such environments is growing. Some recent examples include deployment at individual universities seeking to reform their curriculum, as a technique for students to better organize teams in classes like capstone design, the transformation of academic departments, and the formation of cross-disciplinary research teams to address ""grand challenges."" This paper describes the process and its application to engineering education, specifically in an effort to increase the range and quality of innovation and entrepreneurship offerings for undergraduate engineering students.",Nilsen E.; Monroe-White T.; Morrison E.; Weilerstein P.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,Purdue University;SageFox Consulting Group,
Team learning behaviors: Supporting team-based learning in a first-year design and communications course,"Background: This research paper describes a study that investigated two types of team learning behaviors - exploring and exploiting - in the context of first-year engineering student teams. Exploration and exploitation are classified as two distinct learning activities. Exploratory learning (the pursuit of new knowledge) involves flexibility, variation, and experimentation. Exploitative learning (use of existing knowledge) involves refinement, efficiency, and execution of work. Thus, exploratory learning involves acquiring new capabilities, whereas exploitative learning involves refining existing knowledge and abilities. We hypothesized that, at early stages of a teams' project work, exploratory behaviors are helpful while exploitative ones are harmful. Importantly, at later stages this relationship reverses. At some point teams need to transition from acquiring knowledge to refining and executing based on that knowledge. Accordingly, at later stages, exploitative behaviors may be helpful whereas continued exploratory behaviors may distract from successful execution of the work. Goal orientation (GO) is a dispositional, motivational orientation that directs an individual's approach to achievement situations. There are two primary types of GOs: learning goal orientation (LGO) and performance goal orientation (PGO). Team members' traits can be averaged to represent the team's aggregate trait level, which can be predictive of team processes and performance. Thus, we consider dispositional GO at the team-level as an antecedent of teamlevel learning behavior. LGO is characterized by a drive to explore new topics or techniques with an emphasis on gaining new skills and expertise. In contrast, PGO is described as a concern for executing and accomplishing work in order to receive external rewards and demonstrate ability. Thus, PGO individuals seek to demonstrate competence, whereas LGO individuals seek to build competence. We hypothesized that teams high on LGO will spend more time engaged in exploratory learning because it offers a chance to gain new knowledge. On the other hand, we predicted that high PGO teams will engage in learning behaviors that have a stronger connection to task completion. Given the uncertain nature of exploring, PGO teams may be more likely to focus on exploitative learning activities in order to build on existing certainties. Method: The sample consists of 540 students (29% female) enrolled in an engineering design and communication course in a large North American university. Students were arranged into 4-person teams and were required to build a functioning prototype of a rover capable of picking up and displacing a rock. Learning measures were collected during lab each week over the course of the project. Additionally, we collected trait information (i.e., Goal Orientations) from all students at the beginning of the study. After teams presented their prototype, teaching assistants completed innovation ratings for the teams in their lab section. Random coefficient modeling, a multi-level procedure that handles non-independence of observations, was used to test the study hypotheses. Results: Results indicated that teams tend to pursue both learning actions simultaneously and increase these behaviors over time, however these learning behaviors were not related to subsequent innovation performance. Additionally, we found that the composition of team members' personality traits predicted the type of learning behaviors that teams engaged in. Specifically, teams consisting of members with high LGOs engaged in significantly more exploratory learning exploratory than teams lower on this trait. Interestingly, teams with a high PGOs engaged in greater levels of exploitative learning behaviors. Implications: The implications of the study findings are three-fold. First, our research highlights the importance of considering team composition variables when grouping students into project teams. Second, it calls attention to the temporal nature of exploratory and exploitative learning activities. Third, it suggests future research is needed to examine the implication of these learning activities on outcomes other than innovation (e.g., individual learning, project grades, team potency).",Larson N.; Hoffart G.; O'Neill T.; Eggermont M.; Rosehart W.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,University of Calgary,
Exploring societal interaction with emerging technologies,"Emerging technologies are an integral part of technological progress in this era. Research in emerging technologies is characterized as having a sudden or persistent impact on society by inducing far-reaching changes in an attempt to influence the human quality of life. While scientific progress gets leeway when research is concerned, as it is difficult to exactly predict the outcomes of a hypothesis till all avenues are explored, it also faces obstacles when research touches human safety or the concept of human life and dignity. Hence, progress in research of emerging technologies is strongly predisposed to the attitudes of society and perceptions of individuals. These perceptions, however, may be prejudiced by political and religious opinions, among other reasons. Strong political opinions regarding emerging technologies might appear to represent the collective morality of individuals backed by a religious base. Even though individual opinions are based on multiple factors, public opinion might just be a spin off reaction to the common factors amongst these individual opinions. These factors include but are not limited to public policy, political agenda, and affiliations, individual morality based on religious beliefs, safety concerns, and societal perceptions. Ethical questions that are associated with emerging technologies and the factors influencing individual opinions can be broadly classified as safety and welfare, political and religious agenda, and individual perception. A survey was created as part of a study aimed at ranking these factors that influence individuals in forming an opinion about an emerging technology. The purpose of the study was to provide knowledge that can be used by ethical engineers and scientists into applying innovation and creativity to help society arrive at properly informed middle ground solutions. The survey responders were asked to support or oppose an emerging technology. The opinions of their political leaders and religious leaders were included along with perception or image associated with that research while explaining the potential risks and benefits of the emerging technology. 82% of the responders said that the most important factor that influenced their decision was safety concerns and 61% said that negative or positive image associated with the research was the second factor. The survey ascertained that political and religious objection to emerging technology that seemed to be based on the moral bias of the society neither represent nor fuel the ethical objections to emerging technologies. As knowledgeable citizens, the role of ethical engineers and scientists involved in research can be envisaged as going beyond educating society passively and becoming an essential part of helping society establish a public policy regarding emerging technologies through properly informing society of the facts. In order for these public policies to move research and development past gridlocks of advancement based on prejudiced perception, they must encompass middle ground solutions.",Balasubramanian P.; Barakat N.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,Grand Valley State University,Bioethics ;  Ethics engineering ;  Ethics of emerging technologies ;  Societal impact
Raising interest in STEM education: A research-based community college-university partnership for improving minority participation,"Despite recent efforts, the fraction of underrepresented minorities employed in STEM fields mismatches the current demographics of the United States (U.S). In this context and over the past two years, an educational program between the Community College of Philadelphia and Drexel University with the overall objective to increase the interest of underrepresented minority students (URMs) in STEM has been implemented. The working hypothesis for the University component of this effort has been that learning about science and engineering is most effective if it is paired with the challenge of independent research in a collaborative ""micro-environment"", such as the one in academic research laboratories. In this approach, six undergraduate URMs (three male, three female) were selected in the inaugural year, expanding to eight students (four male, four female) in the program's second year. Each student selected a faculty advisor and research group aligned to their individual interests within the first week of the ten week program. From the outset, students were introduced to key library professionals and digital search tools which they employed to review literature relevant to their research foci, forming a basis for research proposals. By week four, students presented their research plans before a panel of faculty and student judges. To enrich individual research experiences, weekly seminars with guest lectures and discussions on modern drivers of STEM research were integrated in this summer research program. In order to complete the program, each student produced three final deliverables - an oral presentation, a technical poster and a final paper. In addition, students were exposed to an industrial R&D setting through a visit to a multinational corporation known for its innovation. A final survey and individualized assessments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the program and progress of the individual students, respectively. Students demonstrated familiarity with basic research methods and universally reported increased interest in STEM education and careers, with several continuing to work in their labs beyond the program's formal duration.",Christe D.; Wisner B.; Bhatt J.; Kontsos A.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,Drexel University College of Engineering,Community colleges ;  Minority participation ;  Research-based learning
Game-theory approach on a university-industry collaboration model,"In the fiercely competitive global marketplace, innovation alone is no longer enough. University-industry collaboration has been identified to be one of game changer to sustain the innovation ecosystem. Many research centers have been established to provide a platform for collaboration between university researchers and industrial research managers. Its benefits are substantial to both ends. The benefits are mutual, particularly in terms of students who complete university programs and join industry research and development teams. The U-I collaboration, on one hand, brings in ideas in the academic forefront to accelerate technological advancement in industrial firms, on the other hand, strengthens the education of engineers and mathematicians, and economists at universities by providing research projects generated by real technological issues from industry. It is clear that this marriage invigorates the current stereotype engineering education through new industrial challenges. However, not many university-industrial ties are as well established as university to university or company to company collaborations within academia or within industry. Thus, it is imperative to conduct a scientific study on the mechanism of university-industry collaborations and provide insights on possible measures and strategies that research centers can take to promote university-industry links. In this paper, we establish a mathematical model for the utility of both collaborative parties in a university-industry collaboration network. We analyze the criteria a firm should apply to select an academic collaborator to optimize its utility from its R&D investment which includes an investment in a future workforce. We also analyze the criteria a university engineering research team should apply to select a project from a firm to enhance its research capacity and diversify its engineering programs as well.",Zhang J.; Lu Y.; Xie Z.; Haile D.; Williamson K.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,Virginia State University,Cooperative game ;  Economic network ;  Noncooperative game ;  Optimization ;  Stock of knowledge
An earthquake engineering education research methodology for game-based learning,"The authors present a research paper about an innovative research and development (R&D) methodology for game-based learning to integrate engineering education and 21st century learning. Prior to game development, a literature review on gaming revealed a lack of systematic methods for integrating research into design and implementation strategies of many game-based learning environments, much less one for enhancing learners' understanding of engineering and advancing abilities to think critically, argue scientifically, and use metacognition to analyze strategic thinking. We employed a non-linear, holistic methodology framed by Dick, Carey, and Carey's instruction-based R&D template to develop a collaborative-competitive board game for middle and high school students, entitled Earthquake. We integrated critical game-design techniques for the game to be enjoyable while increasing players' knowledge and expertise through repetitive play. The instruction-design template contains five R&D phases: Analyze, Develop, Design, Implement, Evaluate. In the Analyze phase, we established learning objectives to introduce players to earthquake engineering while enhancing critical thinking, scientific argumentation, and metacognition. With learning objectives established, we began the Develop phase for game prototyping, assisted by nine focus groups of experts (n=16) from various backgrounds, including science education, civil engineering, gaming, teaching, and educational administration. We used this resulting prototype in the Design phase for teachers (n=14) to testplay. The use of teacher-participants satisfied fundamental game-design principles: that three to five game-testers sufficiently elucidate mechanical and aesthetic kinks, and that prototype-testers represent a sample of individuals familiar with the context in which the game would eventually be implemented. Four teacher-groups played Earthquake once in a professional development engineering education workshop. Abiding by game-design protocol, each group contained three or four teachers. After the test-play, we conducted semi-structured interviews of each teacher-group. Questions probed what teachers learned about earthquake engineering, what they did and did not like, what they would change, and how effective they thought the game was in teaching interconnectivity of urban infrastructure components. We analyzed interview transcripts with constant comparison qualitative methodology to capture emergent patterns among teachers' comments. Results indicated needs for more player roles, clarifications in playing cards, and the production of an introductory video to highlight the game's function. We integrated these Design-based results during the Implement phase to modified Earthquake again for the Evaluate phase. During the Evaluate phase, six high school students formed two groups to play the game twice in one after-school session. Students remained in the same group for both games. We video-recorded students' game-play for both games. Using a game-based learning checklist (inter-coder reliability of 87%), we analyzed videotapes to identify qualities of students' dialogue and actions. The checklist served to document and compare evidence of met learning objectives. Our comparisons of first and second plays showed student-gains for earthquake engineering content knowledge, critical thinking, scientific argumentation, and metacognition, thus providing evidence of effectiveness of this particular instructional innovation in advancing students' knowledge and abilities in engineering. Furthermore, we found the R&D methodology provided an appropriate, systematic framework for integrating research methodologies at every phase in the R&D process.",Perkins A.; Fry G.; Stuessy C.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,College of Engineering,
The impact of fluid dynamics research on undergraduate education,"The obtaining of an undergraduate degree concludes a successful student university career. For many pursuing an undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering, the process can be tedious and difficult. Much like an engineering design, an engineering education requires specific tools to see the problem from design to production. For many, the desired solution to producing the degree is supplemented only by an introductory design class, a few hands on laboratories that provide an introduction to a few key basic concepts, and a capstone course that requires the implementation of the acquired knowledge in a final design project intending to mimic the design process that would be expected in industry. However, undergraduate research can go beyond complementing the university education. Participating in undergraduate research can supplement an engineering education to provide the tools necessary to be successful as an engineer in industry or lead into a fruitful graduate education. Specifically, undergraduate research in fluid dynamics can allow for the engineering process to be viewed, performed and reevaluated on a continuing basis as the increasing level of coursework allows for a greater amount of knowledge from which to innovate. An ideal case for engineering education to benefit from fluid dynamics research would begin with the participation in a ""bridge"" program that allows for incoming students to experience the research and design process behind current fluid dynamics problems that can be developed upon throughout an educational career. The ""bridge"" program would lead into continuing academic research and experimentation in a fluid dynamics area of interest. As the student's knowledge base expands, the overall engineering process becomes well rounded and refined through practical experience in furthered engineering research. The techniques and ideas that develop through research can be employed in educational coursework within or outside the field of fluid dynamics. To evaluate the benefits of research on an undergraduate education in mechanical engineering, the implementation of fluid dynamics research is explored for the case of a student who is involved in academic research from the beginning of the university career through the completion of a master's thesis in an accelerated bachelor's, master's program. Specifically, the use of engineering software for design and simulations and the technical skills for fabrication and experimentation, and the practical benefits these have on education when hands-on approaches are taken in the classroom will be explored. The educational aspects of fluids dynamics research can go beyond exploring minimally studied subject areas. The specific skills and techniques required to solve engineering problems that are being learned will consistently provide an educational edge in the classroom where innovative solutions to problems are expected. Additionally, two more cases will be explored; one in which a student has limited involvement in research, and a third case: a student is introduced to research in the senior year of his undergraduate degree. Ultimately, the research and educational experiences can come together in producing an innovative and industry-level capstone design project that could lay the foundation for a successful graduate thesis or dissertation if desired. Undergraduate research throughout an engineering education can provide a fuller look at engineering technologies that allows for innovation and well-rounded thinking that can produce the solutions to academic, scientific, and practical problems alike.",Gillispie A.; Dorety A.; Meier A.; Armstrong G.; Lemley E.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,University of Central Oklahoma,
Enhancing the pedagogy of bio-inspired design in an engineering curriculum,"In addition to providing the technical expertise required to solve 21st century problems, the engineers of 2020 will be expected to adapt to a continuously evolving environment while operating outside the limits of their discipline and remaining ethically grounded. Their undergraduate training must therefore be designed to nurture engineers to transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries, and to communicate, transfer knowledge, and collaborate across technical and nontechnical boundaries. One approach to this challenge is to incorporate biomimicry or bio-inspired design into the engineering curriculum. Our research aims to create instructional resources that provide exposure to the abundance of design examples that can be found in nature, and scaffold the discovery and knowledge transfer processes so that those natural designs can be used to inspire engineering solutions. This research is expected to produce knowledge that will improve student learning, STEM literacy, cross-disciplinary thinking, and innovation. Bio-inspired design is also expected to enhance the diversity and inclusion of ideas, and to attract women and minority students with diverse backgrounds to pursue STEM fields. Its ultimate benefit, we hope, will be to fuel the design innovations needed to create a more sustainable future for humankind.",Nagel J.; Pidaparti R.; Rose C.; Beverly C.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,University of Georgia;James Madison University,
Impacts of engineering engagement activities for first-year students,"Serving the demands for future engineering professionals in our society requires increasing retention of students in year one. This study is focused on students enrolled in Innovation in Design, which is a semester-long introduction to engineering course for freshmen students at a large research university in the northwest. The course is an interactive, hands-on experimental introduction to several engineering discipline projects and employs a flipped classroom approach to explain fundamental engineering concepts before students apply and test those concepts in the classroom experiments. This structure exposes students in year one to engineering applications, with an additional piece of the course designed to further engage students in the engineering school and research activities. The Engineering Engagement assignment, which is the focus of this study, is posed to broaden student exposure to engineering outside of the classroom. Our approach consists of two types of engagement, where students choose between attending a research seminar or a club meeting. Assessment of the effect of engagement activities on motivation was performed with the Science Motivation Questionnaire II, adapted to engineering courses. Test results were analyzed using three engineering engagement activities: research seminar, club meeting, and senior presentations as independent variables and the five motivation constructs from the SMQ-II as dependent variables. None of the constructs showed statistical significance.",Burgher J.; Van Wie B.; Reinkens K.; Pitts S.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,Washington State University Pullman,
How does a flipped classroom impact classroom climate?,"This research paper describes an investigation into the impacts of a flipped pedagogy on student-perceived classroom climate. We used the College and University Classroom Environment Inventory (CUCEI) to assess the classroom climate in both the flipped class and various control classes that were not flipped. This inventory includes seven psychosocial dimensions of classroom climate: personalization, involvement, student cohesiveness, satisfaction, task orientation, innovation, and individualization. Our specific research questions were: 1. Do students perceive a more positive classroom climate in a flipped classroom vs. a traditional lecture-based course when controlled for course content and instructor? 2. What psychosocial dimensions were most impacted by the flipped pedagogy? 3. What do these results indicate about student motivation in a flipped classroom? One group of students (Group ""A"") had just completed the flipped course. The second group (Group ""B"") consisted of students who had just completed the same course, but taught in a traditional format. This was to control for the effect of the course material on student's motivation and interest. The third group (Group ""C"") consisted of students who had just completed a different engineering course taught by the same instructor in a traditional format. This was to control for a different instructor. The groups were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA. The responses were analyzed based on each of the seven subscales within the CUCEI, as well as on an overall score combining all seven subscales. The results show that overall the flipped class results in a higher score in both overall classroom climate and for the individualization subscale. In addition we found higher averages for task orientation when controlled for instructor. When controlled for the course content, the flipped course is more innovative and students get to know each other more. The implications of these findings on flipped classrooms are important to those faculty wishing to flip their course.",Velegol S.; Zappe S.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,Pennsylvania State University,
Growing experimental centric learning: The role of setting and instructional use in building student outcomes,"The need for experimental centric learning in engineering education has been a major area of discussion and innovation for the last decade. Research has proven that, in general, the impact on student learning is beneficial. Little literature is available, however, on the impact of instructional use and learning setting when this approach is used. This paper presents preliminary results from a two year collaboration of 13 HBCU electrical and computer engineering (ECE) programs working collaboratively on the development, implementation, and expansion of Experimental Centric based instructional Pedagogy (ECP) in essentially all engineering courses in which circuits and electronics play significant role. As of June 2015, the 13 participating institutions have produced, piloted, and internally distributed 64 curriculum modules and/or labs. The purpose of this paper is to provide preliminary results of an investigation of the relationship of learning setting and instructional use of experimental centric learning, especially for students of color. Learning settings studied include: 1) traditional classrooms, 2) lab settings and 3) homework. Variations by instructional use included: 1) instructor demonstration, 2) cooperative and 3) independent student use. Student outcomes reflect gains in: 1) pre-requisites to learning; 2) immediate short-term learning; 3) long-term and transferable outcomes and 4) selected ABET characteristics (importance and preparedness). Findings indicate that both setting and instructional use do influence selected outcomes and that prior identified patterns of instructor development when incorporating new practices are upheld. The study begins a conversation on the implications of these influences and the need for further research on how students, faculty, and instructional practices change when using experimental centric learning.",Astatke Y.; Connor K.; Newman D.; Attia J.; Nare O.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,Roy G.

"Assessing the efficacy of K-12 engineering outreach ""Pick up and go"" kits","With the growing emphasis of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education at the K-12 level, many schools are reaching out to colleges and universities to have engineering faculty and students visit their classrooms. However, engineering faculty and students may be reluctant to engage in this outreach because they do not have the time or resources to develop an appropriate activity. To address this issue ""pick up and go"" engineering activity outreach modules were developed, piloted and assessed in K-12 classrooms and afterschool programs. These activity modules were developed to incorporate research based best practices and principles that have been found to be successful in attracting girls to engineering and all activities were mapped to the Ohio Academic Content Standards. The modules focused on engineering design and innovation, such that the activities encouraged team work, creativity and problem solving. Scenarios were provided as part of the activities to demonstrate the social relevance of engineering. The kits contained all materials needed to facilitate the activities, a memory stick with an introductory power point presentation, complete instructions aimed at both the college student facilitator and a separate document for the K-12 teacher, evaluation forms and pre- and post-test forms. Through this project, nine kits were fully developed, piloted and assessed. These kits were facilitated to over 1200 K-12 students, primarily in grades 3 through 6. Facilitator feedback showed that the kits were easy to use and the instructions were both complete and easy to follow. The teachers felt that their students learned a great deal about engineering from these activities. The mean gain in pre- to post-test scores was found to be significantly greater than zero for all students, however the main gain for the female students was found to be higher than that of the male students. These results show that the outreach activities were effective at increasing the K-12 students' attitudes, interest and awareness towards STEM, but they were more effective for the females.",Pinnell M.; Hart E.; Bistrek L.; Tensley S.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,University of Dayton School of Engineering;University of Dayton,
Assessment of a collaborative NSF RET program focused on advanced manufacturing and materials,"Manufacturing is a key pillar to economic vitality and growth in the United States (US). However, the US faces increasing competition in the area of manufacturing from across the globe. As such, the future of the US's role in manufacturing requires innovation, cutting-edge and sustainable technologies, and new materials. Furthermore, this new era of manufacturing will require a well-educated and well-prepared STEM workforce. Since the task of inspiring and preparing K-12 students in STEM falls largely on K-12 teachers, it is critical that the teachers understand the role of materials and manufacturing in the US and are provided with the tools and knowledge that will empower them to get children excited about STEM as well as careers in materials and advanced manufacturing. The main objective of the Collaborative Research Experience for Teachers Program entitled Inspiring The Next Generation of a Highly-Skilled Workforce in Advanced Manufacturing and Materials was to provide current and future middle and high school teachers with the skills required to successfully engage their students in STEM learning experiences by immersing these teachers in real-world engineering research that was thematically centered around materials and advanced manufacturing. This collaborative RET site placed teachers and pre-service teachers with research mentors at one of three regional universities to work on engineering research projects that connect with regional strengths in advanced manufacturing and materials. Participating teachers and pre-service teachers joined other professionals in the region in an immersive materials ""boot camp"" facilitated by ASM prior to the start of their research experience. Field trips, guest speakers and group work that produced K-12 curriculum complemented the teams' research experience. During the culminating activities, the groups presented the STEM curriculum developed, the final laboratory project results and provided regular guided reflections regarding their efforts during the six-week program. Local System Change (LSC), Mathematics Teaching Efficacy and Beliefs Instrument (MTEBI) and Science Teaching Efficacy and Beliefs Instrument (STEBI) surveys were administered to identify changes in attitudes, beliefs and practices. Results of the evaluation suggest that this collaborative RET program was successful at meeting a majority of its nine objectives. Evaluation data shows that there was no significant changes at the 0.05 level in the teachers' responses to the MTEBI or STEBI. For the LSC, teacher responses were significantly higher at the 0.01 level for attitudes towards teaching.

Designettes in capstone: Characterizing the impact of early design experiences on students' capstone education,"Full engineering design experiences often require months to accomplish. In an effort to incorporate design, design thinking, and design innovation into curriculum without consuming extensive time, the use of shortened design experiences, referred to as ""designettes,"" has been undertaken. A designette can provide a partial or concentrated design experience by either removing certain parts of a full design process, or by focusing on certain steps, or both. A designette allows students various experiences with the design process that can provide a ""learning scaffold"" for their implementation of the full suite of design methods over the course of a longer project. Designettes likewise provide a mechanism and construct for learning multi-disciplinary technical content and skill sets. In the current educational research, the project focus of a designette was selected from one of two options: either a small, related portion of a larger project, or a totally unrelated project with respect to a larger project. The advantage of a designette being a small part of a larger project is that the time spent on the designette is directly related to the project goals of that larger project. The advantage of having an unrelated designette is that the students feel freedom to take risks and focus on creativity and innovation because they do not experience the stress related to satisfying the sponsor that comes with the larger project. Faculty and student feedback was primarily used to characterize and compare the designette's effectiveness. The current research shows that there are distinct advantages and disadvantages to having the designette project either related, or unrelated to a longer term, sponsored project, such as in a capstone experience. Those who implement designettes can use the detailed data provided in this research to determine which approach best matches their capstone program's distinctive attributes and goals.",Cooper C.; Anderson M.; Jensen D.; Fulton J.; Wood K.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,Singapore University of Technology and Design;United States Air Force Academy;United States Air Force,

Developing flexibly adaptive skills through progressive design challenges,"This research study explores the potential of using a progression of design challenges in a studio setting to develop students' ability to adapt to solving complex challenges. Engineering design blended with challenge-based instructions (a model of project based instruction) provides an excellent model of instruction for obtaining multiple learning outcomes associated with developing content knowledge, innovation skills, project management strategies, professional skills (communicating, teaming, leadership) and disposition for sustained inquiry. Many first year engineering programs provide design challenges for teams to work on during the term (for example). However, sometimes these challenges may be too large to allow all team members to engage in the design process deeply. Further, instructors cannot observe teams in action during their design process, which makes it difficult to provide feedback. Nor can they assess teams' workflow process as they transfer what they learn into knowledge needed to define a solution. Over the past two years we have used a collection of small design challenges at multiple times of the year to help teams practice and reflect on their processes of design, teaming and project management. These two hour design sessions engaged learners in a short conceptual design around an interesting problem. After each session the students reflected on their process and then discussed as a class. A self-report survey was used to evaluate students' perceptions of their process. Students report a positive increase in their team's ability to manage their processes. In addition they report being more confident in approaching challenging design activities like the larger class projects. This paper outlines principles for constructing an effective design experience for undergraduate engineering education that co-develops design skills and the professional skills associated with a productive team's workflow and effective communication of research finding.",Brophy S.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,Purdue University,
Facilitating learner self-efficacy through interdisciplinary collaboration in sustainable systems design,"An educational partnership between a minority-serving community college and a research university has been offering STEM students an eight-week summer internship in sustainable energy systems with the goal of providing applied research experiences while strengthening community and institutional bonds. In 2015, the interns' involvement in the successful design, development, and implementation of an innovative testbed for assessment of grid supporting ""smart"" technology was facilitated by early preparations for self-directed learning. Here, we provide detailed descriptions of a phased pedagogical approach that was instrumental in enabling participants from multidisciplinary and diverse backgrounds to effectively communicate, contribute, and innovate. Heavy scaffolding through a series of controlled yet experiential learning activities targeted key engineering content and process skills, while positioning learners to be efficacious during the research and development phase. Participants formed transitional development teams that restructured based on current project needs; each group member took responsibility for becoming an ""expert"" in self-prescribed roles: wireless communication protocol, residential electrical wiring, embedded systems design and programming, construction technique, research and characterization of ""smart"" loads, among others. This paper presents evidence of a) group interaction and individual participation in practices facilitating the collaborative emergence of innovation and b) learner self-efficacy, which we postulate are correlated. Exit interviews, audio diaries, and a survey instrument assessing interactive engagement in learners were used in analyses of the learning processes and learning outcomes of this case study. Findings point to the importance of allowing participants to identify and take ownership of a discrete set of tasks while expanding skillsets and building peripheral knowledge through facilitated collaboration across domain-specific working groups. This case study culminates in a discussion of four constitutive processes of innovation: choice, challenge, accountability, and cross-disciplinary synergy, as being predictive of the learner's ability to participate in collaborative, group-level innovation.",Favaloro T.; Ball T.; Graham Z.; Isaacson M.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,"University of California, Santa Cruz",
A new approach to teach electrical engineering using a para didactic laboratory,"The objective of this paper is to report the implementation of a Para didactic Laboratory in a private college of engineering in Brazil to improve the training of engineering students so that they can become industry-ready graduates. A very important component in the education of an engineer is the professional tacit knowledge which is obtained through the interaction with more experienced professionals. This normally takes place after graduation. In order to expose the students to an element of professional tacit knowledge sooner, in lieu of the traditional approaches such as curriculum change and teacher training, we founded a Para didactic Laboratory at our college of engineering where a professional engineering consultant acted as a Mentor/Coach of students while they worked together on real projects. This new approach and environment are designed to prepare the students to: • Engage and contribute to the process of engineering or technological entrepreneurship sooner. • Accelerate the process of going from concepts to prototypes and to the final product with confidence. • Minimize the risks associated with product development phase, reducing time to market. • Team up with other students from different fields and backgrounds. • Interact with professionals and participate in meetings with business owners and clients. The Para didactic Lab also acted as a Local Innovation System, a convergence point for business representatives, undergraduate and graduate students, researchers and engineers, all of them aiming to transform research results and ideas into solutions for real problems and the creation of new products and services. This paper also highlights to the negative aspect of the encapsulation of technology in education, referred to here as the ""Aladdin Effect"".",Monsâo I.; Cerqueira J.; Da Costa A.; Dias J.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,Universidade Estadual de Campinas;Universidade Federal da Bahia,
Fostering institutional change in innovation and entrepreneurship: A social network analysis approach,"Over the last decade, faculty champions across the country have made significant strides in integrating innovation and entrepreneurship (I&E) into engineering education. However, such efforts have not resulted in lasting and widespread change. This purpose of this study is to understand the degree to which a national network of faculty can promote sustained change in this domain. In so doing, this paper presents the results of a social network analysis (SNA) of the Pathways to Innovation Program (Pathways), and links network data to key programmatic inputs and institutional outcomes. Pathways, the faculty-development arm of the National Center for Engineering Pathways to Innovation (Epicenter), is designed to help institutions infuse innovation and entrepreneurship (I&E) experiences into the undergraduate engineering experience. Pathways is a structured inter-organizational network of approximately 400 individuals at 50 institutions whose primary objective is to transform the undergraduate experience of engineering students by embedding I&E into undergraduate engineering1. Over the course of two years, Pathways teams turn their ideas into educational innovations aimed at improving the quality and quantity of I&E offerings on campus. To accomplish this goal, Pathways provides opportunities for teams to interact with each other, and subject matter experts, through a series of face-to-face gatherings and online activities. The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between the network structure of Pathways teams and shared outcomes in I&E offerings on campus that result from knowledge flows between the teams and other influencers in the Pathways community. To explore these relationships, the authors administered a novel SNA instrument to examine the extent to which network collaborations and communications relate to team outcomes, and understand how network differences both before and after joining Pathways contribute to successful change efforts. This research aligns with the extensive literature review that informed the design of Pathways, which emphasized the importance of a peer network in the design of an effective faculty development program2. Drawing upon research on community networks within a collective impact framework3,4, the authors hypothesize that the Pathways initiative, which ""⋯involv [es] a centralized infrastructure, a dedicated staff, and a structured process that leads to a common agenda, shared measurement, continuous communication, and mutually reinforcing activities among all participants"" (p. 1)4 would positively impact the I&E ecosystem at participating institutions. The program's sizeable network of institutions, collective impact design, and emphasis on fostering inter-organizational communication and collaboration towards a shared goal makes it an excellent source of study for other large-scale initiatives aimed at fostering change in the post-secondary educational context. Results of this study will contribute to our understanding of inter-organizational and team-based collaboration networks to promote educational innovations in engineering education.",Matthew V.; Monroe-White T.; Engelman S.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,SageFox Consulting Group,
Igniting creativity and innovation in engineering students: The case for technology and society courses in engineering curricula,"Engineering educators have long struggled with coaxing creativity from their students, given the massive amount of prescriptive material that must be covered in their curricula. If students want to graduate in four years, they have very limited time to explore unique interests outside of their specific engineering discipline. A technology and society course offers a tremendous opportunity to bring in material relevant to engineering students at a personal and professional level, and demonstrates applications of skills they are learning in their quantitative courses. This paper describes such a course taught at the University of Calgary that is structured to motivate innovation and entrepreneurship, and to empower students to envision the positive change they can make with skills they have acquired throughout their education. The course consists of over 120 students from second year to fifth year, from all disciplines of engineering offered at the school. The sheer number and diversity of the students required flexibility in material and assessment. As such, the students were given the open prompt of finding a social problem they care about, and devising a technological solution to address it. They were encouraged to consider their solution all the way to implementation, which would require tasks such as talking to regulators, conducting market research, and running surveys. In addition, the students were coached to consider multiple dimensions of framing an engineering problem and solution, as well as how to pitch their ideas targeting four bottom lines: technical acumen, social benefit, environmental impact, and economic viability. In a course that has traditionally been viewed simply as a necessary requirement, many students came alive. Some students are exploring patent options for their innovations, others soliciting partnerships with sports franchises, and others acquiring summer internships as a result of their projects. This paper presents student assessment on the social dimensions of engineering as well as their ability to make a difference in the world, as a consequence of this course.",Chang S.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,University of Calgary,
Disseminating innovation and entrepreneurship initiatives throughout a STEM-focused campus: An agile experience,"Colorado School of Mines is a top public research university focusing on the STEM disciplines, with rigorous academics and a culture that encourages students to make a positive impact on our world. There is an undeniable thrust across engineering education to propel innovation and entrepreneurship throughout the undergraduate student experience, and it applies to our institution. In the fall of 2015, a small team of faculty and one student initiated a ambitious effort to build an ecosystem of innovation and entrepreneurship at Colorado School of Mines from the grassroots level using an agile approach of learning, doing, and iterating. This agile approach quickly created a critical-mass of activities, involvement and support. Remarkably, within one academic year, the effort successfully cultivated a vibrant and growing culture of innovation and entrepreneurship across the university's community of students, faculty and staff. The journey continues, but this paper describes the approach and activities applied to generate this new culture in a traditional STEM focused campus.",Blacklock J.; Mondry M.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,Colorado School of Mines,
Capturing the differences between two virtual communities of practice models for faculty development,"Faculty development is a possible pathway to inform and encourage adoption of research-based education practices into engineering classrooms. We developed a model for faculty development called a virtual community of practice. In this model we sought to engage faculty with research-based education practices, and more specifically, focus on their implementation of these practices in their courses. Two different VCP designs were utilized in our program. The first cohort (Cycle 1) consisted of faculty that were grouped based on similar courses (n = 77). The second cohort (Cycle 2) consisted of faculty that were grouped based on similar technical engineering disciplines (n = 98). We wanted to determine if there was greater adoption of research-based educational practices depending on whether the VCP was organized around certain courses (Cycle 1) or around certain engineering disciplines (Cycle 2). We developed a self-report survey using Roger's Model of diffusion of innovation to measure faculty member's awareness of, attitudes toward, and adoption of research-based educational practices. A two-way within-subjects repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess significant differences between each cycle. For Awareness, there was not a statistically significant main effect for Cycle (λ = 0.87, F[2,28] = 3.66, p =0.067). However, there was a statistically significant main effect for Cycle for Attitudes (λ = 0.61, F[2,28] = 18.30, p <0.01) and Adoption (λ = 0.46, F[2,28] = 29.85, p <0.01). Adoption had the greatest mean in Cycle 1. Overall, we found that Cycle 1, had significantly greater adoption of research-based education practices.",Nelson K.; McKenna A.; Guerra R.; Pimmel R.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,American Society for Engineering Education;Arizona State University Polytechnic Campus;University of Alabama,
Innovation corps for learning (I-Corps™ L): Assessing the potential for sustainable scalability of educational innovations,"The Innovation Corps for Learning (I-Corps"" L) is an initiative of the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) in cooperation with the University of Minnesota, Arizona State University, Colorado State University, and Tufts University to apply the highly successful principles of NSF I-Corps"" towards a culture that will sustain and scale educational innovations. The NSF I-Corps"" program, on which I-Corps"" L is based, uses established strategies for start-ups to build entrepreneurial skills in the engineering and scientific communities that encourage mainstream application of emerging technologies. The overriding purposes of the 8 week I-Corps"" L course are to (1) provide a framework for each of the participating teams (typically 20 to 24 in a cohort) to assess the potential of their educational innovation for sustainability and scalability, and (2) foster an entrepreneurial mindset within the education community so that education products, programs, and services are designed and implemented in ways that promote widespread adoption. In this paper and poster we summarize the essential features of I-Corps"" L, the changes made in the three iterations of the program thus far, and key evaluation results. We also present our assessment of the potential of the I-Corps"" L to contribute to the transformation of STEM education through the sustaining and scaling of NSF-funded research-based ideas.",Smith K.; McKenna A.; Guerra R.; Korte R.; Swan C.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,American Society for Engineering Education;University of Minnesota Twin Cities;Tufts University;Colorado State University,
Approaches to entrepreneurship and leadership development at an Engineering University,"American universities run efficient projects on development of innovative entrepreneurship for engineering programs. A Russian technological university has adopted a program on commercializing the innovations for engineering PhD students. The paper analyzes the changes in entrepreneurial motivation of PhD students that undergo this course. The growth of competition in the world markets and intensification of economic activities create entrepreneurial risks for market agents. Despite considerable investments into the innovative infrastructure, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates that arise from innovative products are below desirable expectations. Today, the economically active part of the Russian population prefers to derive a steady income as contract employees without any entrepreneurial risks. Investments into construction of industrial parks and other innovative infrastructure are justified mostly if the market residents with competitive products are available. However, low innovative activity, especially in the regions, sets certain doubts on the expectations that these infrastructural objects will be filled with small innovative businesses. Under these circumstances, educational institutions become more important as they can provide regional production clusters, industrial and technical parks with the specialists who possess innovative skills and an economically-oriented mindset. Foreign experience of regional development reveals that many large educational institutions perform the function of innovative cluster centers and form groups of innovative companies involved into both innovative production and social entrepreneurship1. The universities run engineering projects in public services. Since 2001, engineering program students from a university in the United States of America have been developing program products for nonprofit sector2. The strategic plans of engineering programs at certain universities are aimed at intensification of innovations, development of entrepreneurship and leadership3. In practice, the idea of building the knowledge in innovative entrepreneurship along with the leadership motivation that directs students towards organization of start-ups, becomes more popular among universities4. In order to increase the efficiency of innovative entrepreneurial programs, universities prepare engineering entrepreneurship courses for students with different training level and interests towards innovative ideas5. In this respect it is interesting to learn from the experience of regional universities in the USA, Great Britain, and Germany. In this study, we considered the experience of a US university with innovative entrepreneurship infrastructure which was used as the site for start-ups launched by students and faculty who are interested in commercializing their innovative ideas6. Entrepreneurial training for the population eager to launch their own businesses is a widespread practice in the US universities. The university under consideration implements several academic programs both for students and young faculty. The entrepreneurship development program for engineering students (not majoring in Economics) proved to be one of the most effective among such initiatives7. The university's entrepreneurship development center invited MBA students to join contracting activities. Students gain practical experience as economists and market experts in the start-ups located in its innovative park. This center organizes training courses for MBA students and PhD students twice a year. This course is dedicated to commercialization of innovations on their way from a laboratory to the market, and is also focused on the innovative entrepreneurship principles. In 2013, the representatives of a Russian engineering university visited the university in the USA for a short-time training program. The visit has resulted in the development of a new training course at the Russian university. This course is aimed at commercialization of research and foundations of fundraising. The training solves the problem of intensifying innovative and entrepreneurial activities among PhD students of engineering programs8. The course includes lectures and practicums in economic estimation of investments, business planning and taxation of small innovative companies, fundraising mechanisms for project implementation, and administration of innovative projects. Annually 150 PhD students attend the course. To increase its efficiency, a special survey for the participants has been performed prior and after the innovative entrepreneurship course. The purpose of research was to study the motivation toward implementation of entrepreneurial projects and commercializing research results among PhD students and young scientists of engineering programs. In order to achieve the survey goal, the sets of questions were developed to reveal the following: 1. The motivation of PhD students to set up their own business (from 0 to 100 points); 2. PhD student vision on the existing and possible barriers to set up their businesses; 3. Necessary knowledge to start entrepreneurial activities. 150 PhD students participated in the survey prior and after attending the course 'Commercialization of Research: Foundations of Fundraising'. It demonstrated the following statistics: 4.36% of the survey participants with low level of interest in setting up their own business (0 to 60 points) did not change their mind after the course. 2.41% of the survey participants had initial average interest to entrepreneurship development (61 to 80 points), this figure changed to 22% after the course. The percentage of the survey participants with a high motivation to entrepreneurship (81 to 100 points) changed from 23% before the course to 42% after the course. Thus, the proposed training course increased the motivation of the students with a certain interest to business, and did not affect the initially indifferent audience. The results of this research have shown that the participants changed their opinion on the barriers in setting up a personal business: before the course, 12% of the survey participants considered high taxes to be an important barrier, after the course, this figure changed to 8%. Another obstacle is that the intensive competition decreased the number of opinions from 14% initially to 6% of the survey participants after the course. Psychological factors, such as uncertainty and fear were considered important by 12% of the students before the course and only 6% after the course. The absence of a start-up budget was initially believed to be the most important barrier by 30% of the PhD students; this figure, however, changed to 17% after the course. At the same time, a number of barriers received a higher percentage of opinions after the course, among them the lack of a good business idea (from 2% to 6%), administrative barriers (from 4% to 14%), zero business experience (from 2% to 5%), and poor knowledge in Economics (from 5% to 16%). As a result, some students indicated new barriers they found important: economic downturn and lack of a qualified team to commercialize and innovate. Therefore, these students gained a more systematic vision on commercialization of research results. Thus, we think it is important for this innovative entrepreneurship course to consider the initial level of student motivation towards research commercialization. The survey confirmed that the education could be efficient when highly motivated engineering students were enrolled. Moreover, this group of students was the one to demonstrate insufficient expertise in Economics as the main barrier for a start-up. The obtained results make it possible to conclude that the experience of one of the American universities in differentiating the programs of commercializing the innovations in compliance with motivation of PhD students should be taken into account. The graduates of the above mentioned training program contribute to the development of the innovative infrastructure in the region where the described above engineering university is located. The graduates have an opportunity to implement their ideas at a special economic zone with the reduced taxation for international and local startups and a lower cost of residence which is located in the same region as the university is. Another project which demands such graduates are regional technical parks in chemical engineering, petrochemistry, and IT. Thus, entrepreneurship and leadership development for engineering PhD students is primarily important for a Russian university today, in post-oil economy, when the university has to teach its students how to succeed in a global environment9 by developing competitive technological innovations for the world market.",Burylina G.; Sanger P.; Ziyatdinova J.; Sultanova D.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,Kazan National Research Technological University;Purdue Polytechnic Institute,
Innovative design within the context of virtual internships: How can it be defined and how is it related to the student design process?,"Definitions of ""innovative design"" vary among authors and fields of study. This presents a difficulty for those seeking to identify innovation when it occurs in a novel context, such as within the epistemic game Nephrotex. Nephrotex encourages players, who assume the role of virtual interns within the game, to explore a constrained design space with the goal of producing an optimized dialysis membrane as the end product. We have taken as a starting point the definition of Baregheh, Rowley, and Sambrook1, which defines the process leading to an innovative design as ""a process that not only leads to unique physical or technical product attributes but also adds value beyond existing designs on the market."" To evaluate whether a device within Nephrotex adds ""value,"" quality can be assessed based on the work of Arastoopour and colleagues2, and takes technical and economic performance into consideration. Uniqueness of the design can then be determined by employing decision trees to understand at which points in the design process teams make innovative choices that lead to unique, high-quality designs. Higher branches within the decision trees are weighted more heavily in terms of uniqueness. This research was performed with sophomore chemical engineering students in the Spring 2014 and Spring 2015 semesters. A total of 50 teams of approximately 4-5 students each were studied. Half of the teams participated in a focus group as described by Markovetz and colleagues3. Student design processes were evaluated based on design performance as well as weekly design journal entries wherein students reported the three activities they spent the most time on, which were categorized according to the framework of Dym4. We found that participation in a focus group has a medium effect in terms of odds ratio (1.8) in increasing innovation in student designs. From student surveys we found that there were no significant differences between innovative and non-innovative teams in terms of the occurrences of the design activities (grouped by Dym's categories) they spent the most time on (t and MannWhitney tests), though our sample size was small. However, the category with the largest effect size (d=0.68) was management, for which improvements have been shown to increase innovation by Ozaltin5. In terms of design attributes that contribute to generating innovative final products, we observed that teams with lower innovation scores may deprioritize cost while also reviewing prior information more than innovative teams. This is useful in that it provides a map for design decisions that could possibly lead to more innovative designs within the context of constrained design spaces such as Nephrotex.",Markovetz M.; Clark R.; Arastoopour G.; Swiecki Z.; Shaffer D.; Chesler N.; Bodnar C.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,University of Wisconsin-Madison;Rowan University;University of Pittsburgh,
Major observations from a specialized REU program for engineering students with ADHD,"Students with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) tend to experience the traditional education system differently than their peers. The engineering education system has yet to realize unique potential of these students and identify ways in which to handle these differences in order to keep them engaged and successful. Published literature suggests that individuals with ADHD have the potential of strong divergent thinking skills and unparalleled risk-taking. However, this group of students is significantly underrepresented in engineering programs; some work suggests that only 3% of college students with ADHD choose to study engineering. The current design of engineering education largely fails to provoke the interest of these students because of its overemphasis on lecture-based learning and its discouraging evaluation methods. To recognize the unique intellectual strengths of engineering students with ADHD and encourage them to continue in engineering careers, a specialized Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site titled ""REU Site: Research Experience in Cyber and Civil Infrastructure Security for Students with ADHD: Fostering Innovation"" has been funded by the NSF Division of Engineering Education and Centers. This paper presents the significant observations of the performance of these students in research environment and the findings from the evaluation of the program through pre- and post-program surveys. It was found that through several informal and formal peer-to-peer interaction opportunities, the participating students related to one another's similar experiences and struggles in school and everyday life. Their interaction with the PI, who has firsthand experience with ADHD, presented them with a different perspective about their ADHD. The specialized seminars related to ADHD challenges and potentials helped the students gain confidence in their abilities and realize the unique benefits they can offer to the advancement of the nation. The eight participating students became heavily engaged in hands-on research lab activities with no issues related to lack of attention or interest. The majority of the participants intellectually contributed to their research projects, at a level comparable to advanced graduate students. In general, the participating students became more interested in engineering and desired to continue conducting research after the program's conclusion and pursue graduate studies. This experience clearly demonstrated that, in a properly designed education system based on learning-by-doing, students with ADHD might outperform their peers without ADHD-related impairments. This program intends to establish that ADHD may be perceived as a unique strength, not a disability.",Zaghi A.; Tehranipoor M.; O'Brien C.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,University of Connecticut;University of Florida,ADHD ;  Creativity ;  Divergent thinking ;  Research experience ;  REU ;  Risk taking
An application-based learning approach to C programming concepts and methods for engineers,"This paper documents an innovative approach to teaching a 3-credit introductory C programming course to freshman electrical engineering students that has been funded by an NSF DUE grant. The innovation stems from the use of electrical engineering applications and projects to motivate students to master language syntax and implement key programming concepts and best practices. Weekly three-hour laboratory sessions center around writing C code on a Raspberry Pi computer to interact with a variety of sensors, actuators, and electronic components and achieve laboratory goals. The laboratory experience culminates with a multi-week group project designed to challenge the students' new knowledge and skills. The new course has been taught three times from Spring 2014 through Fall 2015 with a total enrollment of about 60 students. The new course has been run in parallel with a traditional 2-credit introductory C class that typically had about twice as many students. Program evaluation was conducted by a research team which operated separately from but advised the team of instructors about course improvements. Mixed research methods included student surveys, classroom observation, and student interviews. Surveys comparing between students in the alternative and the traditional courses were conducted at the beginning and end of each semester, and in the subsequent semester after students took the class. Results show that students found the alternative class more collaborative, less competitive, and having a greater sense of community than the traditional class.",Lawson W.; Secules S.; Bhattacharyya S.; Gupta A.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,A.

Developing engineering leaders: An organized innovation approach to engineering education,"In addition to providing technical expertise in their respective fields, engineers are increasingly assuming leadership roles in industry, government, and non-profit organizations. We draw from lessons learned in our decade-long study of the National Science Foundation (NSF) Engineering Research Center (ERC) program to provide both a theoretical framework and tangible recommendations to educators interested in engineering leadership development. In addition to producing impressive and economically important innovations, the ERC program is an exemplar model for educating engineers who are also uniquely positioned as leaders. ERCs expose students to real-world practices of engineering, providing them with on-the-job training in critical leadership and technical areas. Students often act as the ""glue"" that binds together ERC researchers from different domains, thereby catalyzing communication across disciplines, organizations, job levels, and cultures. ERC-trained students also learn how to manage projects, engage in strategic problem-solving, and implement decisions as they pursue interdisciplinary project work throughout the engineering curricula. In particular, a 2006 NSF study found that 60 percent of the new courses introduced through ERCs had multidisciplinary content as well as a systems focus. Industry has recognized the competitive advantage of graduates from ERC educational programs; nine in ten company supervisors report that former ERC students and graduates are better prepared to work in industry than equivalent hires without ERC experience. Nearly 75 percent of those supervisors say employees with ERC experience were better able to develop new technologies. In addition, hiring students with ERC experience is one of the most prized benefits to companies working with the ERCs. We draw on lessons learned from our decade-long study of the NSF ERC program to propose the Organized Innovation Model for Education, which provides guidance for educators and scholars interested in developing highly skilled engineers who are also leaders.",Perry S.; Hunter E.; Frauenheim E.; Currall S.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,Hankamer School of Business;Southern Methodist University,
Stimulating creativity in online learning environments through intelligent fast failure,"In this paper, we address the stimulation of creativity in online learning environments through our examination of a simple hands-on task aimed at teaching the principles of Intelligent Fast Failure (IFF) in the context of a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) focused on creativity, innovation, and change. A simple physical ""prototyping"" exercise involving common household objects was designed and presented to a global community of online learners using the Coursera MOOC platform. Data gathered from the task outcomes and student reflections were analyzed with respect to gender and cultural differences, as well as correlations between the number of attempts/failures and creative performance metrics. Our results show that while the correlation between number of attempts (i.e., failure rate) and creative performance was statistically significant, the relationship was weak. In addition to these and other quantitative results, this research has value for engineering educators as a case study in the evolution, scaling, and transfer of face-to-face experiential learning tasks to global online learning environments.",Jablokow K.; Zhu X.; Matson J.; Kakde A.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,Penn State College of Engineering;Penn State Great Valley;Pennsylvania State University,
Leveraging enterprise mobility innovation for knowledge sharing in the airline industry with implications for engineering education,"Advances in engineering have led to the continued miniaturization and increased computing power and capabilities of mobile computing technologies. These technical advances get their ultimate start from engineering education that cultivates young people for technical careers of design and development for the Information Age. Engineering education is, therefore, benefiting industry by educating engineers who continue to advance such innovations as mobile computing smartphones. In this paper, we argue that industry can conversely benefit engineering education in how technology is applied for sharing knowledge within and beyond the boundaries of the organization. The airline industry in particular is an area that demonstrates how knowledge sharing experiences can be enabled through the use of mobile computing innovations in the field. Global competition requires firms to rapidly and effectively develop and share knowledge. Knowledge and learning enabled through the use of advanced technologies are, therefore, among the most critical organizational assets for achieving and maintaining competitive advantage. Drawing from the literature streams of knowledge sharing, social learning theory, and IT mobility, this interpretive case study introduces a theoretical two by two framework. This framework serves as our lens for assessing how migrating from using legacy to advanced technologies can motivate and enable learning. Through observations, questionnaires, and interviews, we test the framework in a case study evaluating the benefits gained from the implementation of smartphones replacing walkie-talkies at a global airline. Through our framework, we identify new opportunities and challenges in sharing and learning knowledge via smartphones. We then argue that similar benefits can be gained for engineering education delivery at universities, drawing from social learning theory and a student-centered learning educational pedagogy. Hence, this research is applicable to not only the airline industry, but also to engineering education for greater understanding and leveraging of knowledge sharing through mobile computing.",Schutz D.; Dionne D.; Kim Y.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2016-06-26,Tokyo University of Science;Konkuk University,
Integrating mathematical thinking oriented problem solving approach with blended learning open source science or math studies (BLOSSOMS) modules,"Research indicated that the major practices of engineers rely on mathematical thinking skills. Mathematical thinking and learning in engineering education must address the rapidly changing technological innovations and the associated expectations in terms of the quality of learning experiences. Thus, future engineers need to be actively engaged in deep and meaningful mathematical thinking and learning rather than passive information transmission during their engineering mathematics. This paper presents some results of a study carried out to investigate the potential of blended learning and its implication in supporting mathematical thinking among prospective engineers. Mason's et.al. problem solving approach is integrated with BLOSSOMS modules first to produce activity based worksheets and then to conduct blended learning sessions to cultivate mathematical thinking skills among first year engineering students using duet teaching and collaborative learning approaches. The two staged interpretive data analysis is used to explore and interpret the data. The findings showed that blended learning can positively affect students' learning, thus supporting students to think mathematically in the blended learning environment.",Mahmood A.; Yusof Y.; Othman M.,Conference Proceeding,AIP Conference Proceedings,2016-06-21,Universiti Teknologi Malaysia Kuala Lumpur;Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,blended learning ;  mathematical learning ;  Mathematical thinking ;  mathematics learning environment

Sustainability challenges occur at all stages in the food system from production through processing, distribution, and retailing to consumption and waste disposal. Consequently, the promotion of organic and local foods is not the only way; there is another possibility that may foster continuing the production hegemony, emphasizing biotechnology and technological panaceas.Increasing research is being focused on the development of healthy, quality, and safe food products adapted to consumers' needs and more environmentally friendly processes, that is, processes consuming energy more efficiently, generating less waste, and emitting less greenhouse-effect gases, among other features.This chapter contains detailed information about some measures taken by the food industry to ensure the supply of essential nutrients to as many individuals as possible assuring global sustainability. More specifically, the contributions of some techniques employed in the development of functional foods, such as formulation and blending, cultivation and breeding, microencapsulation, edible films and coatings application, vacuum impregnation and nutrigenomics, to increase the sustainability of the feeding process, are discussed.",Betoret E.; Calabuig-Jiménez L.; Betoret N.; Barrera C.; Segui L.; Fito P.,Book,Innovation Strategies in the Food Industry: Tools for Implementation,2016-06-14,"Universitat Politècnica de València;Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna, Cesena",Biotechnology ;  Environmental ;  Food production ;  Functional food ;  Sustainability
Researchers’ competencies in the coming decade: attitudes towards and expectations of the Russian innovation system,"Purpose: This paper aims to analyse the necessity and sufficiency of researchers’ and engineers’ competencies in the area of science and technology, given oncoming technological changes. Five key questions are addressed concerning the skills and abilities of PhD holders: What competencies do researchers have at present? What competencies are currently used? How valuable are they at the present time? Will they be in demand in 10-15 years? And how relevant are these competencies for working on projects in priority areas of science and technology development? Design/methodology/approach: The analysis was based on data collected by two empirical studies conducted in 2010-2013. A survey of researchers and engineers described the issues with competencies related to the areas of science, technology and innovation. Study among 1,884 PhD holders employed in research institutes, universities and enterprises was carried out. In addition, 30 in-depth interviews were also conducted with experts representing the most promising areas of science and technology development in Russia – nanotechnology, biotechnology and the power engineering sectors. Findings: The results from quantitative and qualitative analyses indicate that general competencies such as fundamental theoretical knowledge, ability to work on projects, teamwork and creativity will be in demand in 10-15 years, rather than highly specialized skills. Employers tend to develop needed skills of researchers involved in innovations directly on the workplace, during the realization of a project. Originality/value: This is the first paper to use solid broad statistical evidence to outline a clear idea of the technological and scientific research competencies that would be required in the future.",Shmatko N.,Journal,Foresight,2016-06-13,HSE University,Engineer ;  Innovation ;  Labour market ;  Researcher ;  Skill ;  Technological foresight
Engaging voices: Methods for studying STEM education at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs),"Purpose: This paper aims to discuss the methods that were used to do egalitarian research with ten Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Rather than doing research “on” these institutions, the authors worked with them to understand their successes and build upon their capacity in the science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) areas. Through this process, the authors aimed to bring exposure and interest to the practices that HBCUs use to increase and nurture success in African American students – practices that are rarely used in mainstream STEM programs and, in fact, run counter to well-established practices across STEM. The goal is to challenge traditional methods for pursuing STEM education research as the authors offer alternative methods the uplift and empower HBCUs. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used the constant comparative method in developing, testing, and writing-up the HBCU success stories. The constant comparative method collects data in a systematic way by engaging in ongoing exploration and verification of findings with key stakeholders (in this case, the teachers, students and staff at the HBCUs). Across the ten HBCUs in the sample, at least one success story or model at each institution was identified; in some instances, there were more. Findings: The research project had several implications for the social and economic health of society. First, supporting the work of HBCUs contributes to the diversification of the STEM fields and addresses the severe drought in the STEM workforce. It is without doubt that a diverse workforce – the unique perspectives and backgrounds of each individual – has a positive and significant influence on progress and innovation in any field. Despite increasingly growing minority communities across the country, many Blacks continue to face roadblocks that impede their opportunities and abilities in the K-20 pipeline and STEM education, specifically. Because HBCUs have a long history and record of tearing down those roadblocks and contributing Black students to the STEM workforce, they are prime and optimal sites for long-term investment. Second, improving the abilities of HBCUs to support student success in STEM also increases the likelihood of greater STEM minority teachers and faculty. A significant factor in the success of minority students in STEM is the opportunity to be taught and mentored by faculty members that look like them and/or deeply understand their personal background and struggles. For many Black students, the presence of a Black science professor can improve and retain student interest and aspiration in STEM. But with so few Black STEM faculty members, many students can easily fall through the cracks. Third, aside from the nation’s security and health, supporting HBCUs’ work in STEM student achievement represents immeasurable benefits for the individual and his/her family for many generations to come (i.e. society overall). Occupations in STEM are plentiful and fruitful for those who achieve the required credentials. Increasing opportunities for Black students to pursue these STEM careers can establish a path toward upward social mobility. The realization of these benefits is contingent upon the investment in early achievement in STEM courses. Research limitations/implications: Several research based outcomes are scheduled to result from this project, including a major policy report on HBCUs and their approaches to STEM education (co-constructed with the HBCU representatives); several peer reviewed articles (authored by us as well as the HBCU representatives); a national convening (showcasing both the best practices and the results of the HBCUs’ funded capacity building projects with the HBCU representatives as the primary speakers rather than us); a website featuring the work of the 10 HBCUs, active use of social media to disseminate the findings of the project; several op-eds written for a general audience and co-authored with HBCU representatives; and an authored book published by a university press. Practical implications: Best practices gleaned from this project are being shared in a scholarly manner, but they will be shared in ways that are accessible to practitioners, including presidents, faculty, academic advisors, student success staff and other HBCU practitioners. In addition, best practices will be shared with majority colleges and universities to strengthen and improve practices more broadly in STEM. The authors are working with organizations such as the Association of American Universities, Association of Public Land Grant Universities and the American Association of Colleges and Universities to showcase the work of HBCUs and disseminate information. Social implications: Conducting research projects in which the research inquiry is co-constructed and the resulting research products are also co-constructed and even co-authored is an empowering and collaborative way to work across institutional types. More importantly, this approach brings attention to those researchers and teachers at HBCUs that are doing the day-to-day work with students, training them to be scientists, doctors and professors. Too often, only those conducting studies on STEM are credited with “discovering” success models for student learning. The authors think that those who have created these models and use them should be recognized and included in the research and dissemination process, and the authors encourage others to think more broadly and openly about collaborative research that engages the voices of HBCU researchers and students. Originality/value: This project also has much to teach others about collaborating through research. First, collaborating when conducting research related to STEM is essential, as it encourages collaboration within STEM and among STEM researchers. HBCU researchers that were a part of our project – biologists, physicist and chemists – were encouraged to work across disciplinary lines and together to understand their own STEM education practices more fully.",Gasman M.; Nguyen T.,Journal,Journal for Multicultural Education,2016-06-13,Seattle University;University of Pennsylvania,African American ;  Black college ;  Education ;  Higher education ;  Learning ;  Race ;  STEM
Social entrepreneurs: innovating rural tourism through the activism of service science,"PurposeThis study aims to construct an integrated social entrepreneur system in the rural area of Hengshan, Taiwan, that could benefit four stakeholders, namely, tourists, business, community and government. Two social entrepreneur cases demonstrate a mutually beneficial situation of lowering the structural unemployment rate, returning young human capital to villages and innovating rural tourism through the activism of service science. Design/methodology/approachQualitative approach was applied to data obtained from 12 research projects spanning three years. Service experience engineering (SEE) methods were used to conduct a service design for social entrepreneurs in an integrated service system. The service system aimed to innovate rural tourism through the activism of service science. FindingsSEE methods explain a series of service design processes that helped our research team start up two social entrepreneur projects as service prototypes to offer service innovation based on cultural creativity to innovate rural tourism. These two social entrepreneurs in rural tourism offer job opportunities to young people and senior citizens alike. In addition, an integrated service system of interdisciplinary knowledge, multi-stakeholders and local resources fulfills various requirements of stakeholders to promote sustainable rural tourism. Research limitations/implicationsReal action studies are limited in the research on social entrepreneurs. This case study provides research insights into service science and calls for action in practice to change the future of a local village. The results provide the philosophy and knowledge of service science that social entrepreneurs of rural tourism can use in the village. Designing service innovation for rural tourism has shaped its vision toward a sustainable tourism system. Originality/valueFew studies have shown that social entrepreneurs could innovate rural tourism. The present study presents an action case through the activism of service science.",Peng K.; Lin P.,Journal,International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management,2016-06-13,The Hong Kong Polytechnic University;Mingshing University of Science and Technology,Rural tourism ;  Service experience engineering ;  Service innovation ;  Service science ;  Social entrepreneur
Designing patient throughput and task management innovations in orthopaedics,"The Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Clinics of the University of Virginia Health System are collocated in the Fontaine Research Park. The two departments operate in separate clinics, but share a Radiology Department. Collectively, the clinics serve about 42,000 outpatient visits annually. With patient visits projected to increase substantially in the coming years, the clinics seek process improvements that will accommodate growth and sustain strong patient satisfaction well into the future. This paper describes a simulation study of patient flows in the clinics under various future demand scenarios, including alternative patient volumes and no-show rates. The study explored the impact of best practices for in-clinic task management, patient and staff scheduling, and patient communications. Key performance measures included patient waiting times, total time in clinic, facility utilization, and on-time clinic closings. The model was developed based on patient schedule and tracking data. The results of the simulation model and clinic observations provided evidence to support multiple process improvements within the clinics. Introducing an additional front desk attendant in each clinic during busy times to assist with incoming phone calls and patient check-ins will allow for patients to be seen sooner and for more efficient appointment scheduling. Altering appointment time slots from 15 minutes to 10 minutes and distributing scheduled appointments more evenly throughout the day will allow providers to see more patients and reduce the need for overbooking, effectively decreasing patient waiting time. Based on the results of our analysis, implementing these changes to the clinics may allow for future growth while preserving patient satisfaction.",Johnson G.; Kiernan J.; Swan A.; Botwick E.; Spier W.; White K.; Valdez J.; Kang H.; Lobo J.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 IEEE Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium, SIEDS 2016",2016-06-10,University of Virginia,Discrete-event simulation ;  healthcare systems ;  outpatient clinic ;  patient flow ;  scheduling

Advances in Nanoimprint Lithography,"Nanoimprint lithography (NIL), a molding process, can replicate features <10 nm over large areas with long-range order. We describe the early development and fundamental principles underlying the two most commonly used types of NIL, thermal and UV, and contrast them with conventional photolithography methods used in the semiconductor industry. We then describe current advances toward full commercial industrialization of UV-curable NIL (UV-NIL) technology for integrated circuit production. We conclude with brief overviews of some emerging areas of research, from photonics to biotechnology, in which the ability of NIL to fabricate structures of arbitrary geometry is providing new paths for development. As with previous innovations, the increasing availability of tools and techniques from the semiconductor industry is poised to provide a path to bring these innovations from the lab to everyday life.",Traub M.; Longsine W.; Truskett V.,Journal,Annual Review of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering,2016-06-07,"Canon Nanotechnologies, Inc.",J-FIL ;  Jet and Flash Imprint Lithography ;  Nanofabrication ;  Thermal NIL ;  UV-curable nanoimprint lithography ;  UV-NIL
Lost in translation: The gap in scientific advancements and clinical application,"The evolution of medicine and medical technology hinges on the successful translation of basic science research from the bench to clinical implementation at the bedside. Out of the increasing need to facilitate the transfer of scientific knowledge to patients, translational research has emerged. Significant leaps in improving global health, such as antibiotics, vaccinations, and cancer therapies, have all seen successes under this paradigm, yet today, it has become increasingly difficult to realize this ideal scenario. As hospital revenue demand increases, and financial support declines, clinician-protected research time has been limited. Researchers, likewise, have been forced to abandon time- and resource-consuming translational research to focus on publication-generating work to maintain funding and professional advancement. Compared to the surge in scientific innovation and new fields of science, realization of transformational scientific findings in device development and materials sciences has significantly lagged behind. Herein, we describe: how the current scientific paradigm struggles in the new health-care landscape; the obstacles met by translational researchers; and solutions, both public and private, to overcoming those obstacles. We must rethink the old dogma of academia and reinvent the traditional pathways of research in order to truly impact the health-care arena and ultimately those that matter most: the patient.",Fernandez-Moure J.,Journal,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,2016-06-03,Houston Methodist Hospital;Houston Methodist,Bench to bedside ;  Clinician-scientist ;  FDA ;  NCATS ;  Translational medicine ;  Translational research
Research on the development of operational ocean observing equipment (OOOE) in China,"Operational ocean observing system (OOOS) can meet the needs of marine disaster prevention and reduction, safeguard socio-economic development in coastal zones, and promote marine resource exploitation. As a solid foundation for the establishment of the OOOS, operational ocean observing equipment (OOOE) is attached great significance across the world. Three kinds of OOOEs in China are introduced and compared with those in developed countries in the aspects of accuracy, measuring range, and operational reliability and stability. The results show that the accuracy of wave height, wave period and wave direction is 0.2 m, 0.27 s and 5°-10° lower in average in comparing with that in the USA, respectively. The accuracy of tide gauges in China's stations is one order of magnitude lower and tide gauges also have relatively low measuring range. China's mooring buoys have shortcomings in communication and transmission, stealing and damage prevention, operational maintenance and intelligent observation compared with the world advanced level. Moreover, performance of cruising range and endurance time of AUG still should be improved significantly in China. The priorities of OOOE development in China are discussed and some suggestions are put forward. OOOEs across the world are becoming more informative and intelligent, with their functions being improved through serialized development, and their reliability is being increasingly enhanced. The priorities of OOOE development in China can be concluded, which include high-precision sensors and materials for improving the performance of instruments, anti-biofouling and corrosion-proof techniques for enhancing operational reliability, as well as intelligent electronic circuits, artificial intelligence and automation techniques for safeguarding observing stability. In addition, it is suggested that appropriate policies and measures be drawn up and implemented, such as focusing on major operational needs, making special planning, promoting core and general technological breakthroughs, constructing the innovation systems and platforms for OOOE, and establishing the access-exit mechanism of operational application.",Wang Y.; Liu W.; Gao Y.,Conference Proceeding,OCEANS 2016 - Shanghai,2016-06-03,Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China,development trends ;  ocean observing stations ;  operational ocean observing equipment (OOOE) ;  suggestions
Considering practitioner-driven innovations: Accommodating information systems within successful humanitarian work,"This paper offers an in-depth analysis of how technology emerged in stories of success from interviews with Red Cross/Red Crescent (RCRC) humanitarian aid workers named for doing good work. Our findings reveal that in these contexts, technology exists, for the practitioners, much like a language - diverse according to environment, culture and skill. As such, practitioners' core mission to effectively identify and communicate the needs of communities among stakeholders and throughout different organizational levels drives innovation. The environment demands innovations by practitioners to ensure the transfer of information, and it's embedded meaning, is bridged across disparate technological modes and information systems. We found a common problem-solving perspective toward work, awareness of gaps in the flow of meaning and information across stakeholders, along with multi-modal, multi-cultural and interpersonal fluencies active where innovations occur. When empowered with the autonomy to adapt tools, successful practitioners are able to support the effective transfer of meaning across cultures, organizational perspective and technological environments. Ultimately, these findings enhance our understanding of the use of technology in humanitarian work. It provides insights for ways to maximize technology effectiveness and reconsider the focus of design beyond the technology alone, and instead calls for a socio-material approach acknowledging technology as part of a larger, more complex system of systems.",Mays R.; Braxton M.; Berry A.; Robinson J.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation/IEEE lnternational Technology Management Conference, ICE/ITMC 2016 - Proceedings",2016-06-01,University of Washington,Adapation ;  Adaptation ;  Disaster preparedness ;  Disaster response ;  Effectiveness ;  Humanitarian practice ;  Humanitarian technology ;  Innovation ;  Resilience ;  Technology design ;  Tools
Observing innovation impacts on supply chain: The case of the Swatch,"Innovation impacts the company and its environment. This paper presents a case study for visualizing the innovation impacts on the company's supply chain. Using a historic case study, we explore how innovations can affect the organization of a supply chain. The company and stakeholders belonging to the supply chain were thoroughly studied. Using data from the literature, the research objective is a better understanding of the influences of innovation on the organization of the supply chain. A methodology is developed to model the supply chain before and after the emergence of the innovation. The evolution inside and outside of the company following the strategic choices, are observed. In this way, the impact of the innovation on the supply chain can be detailed. The results of this study show scenarios to design a new supply chain after the emergence of an innovation. In the future, a methodology will be developed to help managers to anticipate impacts caused by innovation.",Marche B.; Boly V.; Ortt J.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation/IEEE lnternational Technology Management Conference, ICE/ITMC 2016 - Proceedings",2016-06-01,"ERPI (Équipe de Recherche sur les Processus Innovatifs);Faculteit Techniek, Bestuur en Management, TU Delft",Data analysis ;  Empirical case study ;  Innovation ;  Supply chain
Management of product development on architecture evolution: Analyzing the semiconductor exposure tool industry,"Exposure tools used for manufacturing semiconductor chips, are large-scale industry equipment with extremely complex architectures comprised of many key fundamental technologies. Originally, these exposure tools were created as extremely integral products, similar to those seen in the automotive industry, and the Japanese company, Nikon, dominated the market in both share and technology innovation from early 1980's through the mid-1990's. However, at around 2000 the Dutch company, ASML, who entered the market later and managed to overturn Nikon's dominance, capturing over 70 percent of the market by the latter half of the 2000's. Chuma [1] demonstrated that one of the biggest reasons for ASML's remarkable success can be attributed to their adoption of the modular architecture in contrast to Nikon's integral architecture. This paper will describe how Nikon fell into the integrity trap because they embraced the integral architecture so profoundly that Engineers with strong attachments to their traditional architectural knowledge created an information filter. Furthermore, it will also show how ASML who adopted the modular architecture did not fall into the modularity trap but rather established a new modular architecture by developing strong relationships with established customers, suppliers, and industry consortia and implementing an organizational policy where no one person is responsible for multiple generations of architectures.",Enami T.; Taji N.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation/IEEE lnternational Technology Management Conference, ICE/ITMC 2016 - Proceedings",2016-06-01,Graduate School of Business Administration;Gigaphoton Inc,Integrality trap ;  Modularity trap ;  Product architecture ;  Semiconductor exposure component
Software startup ecosystems evolution: The New York city case study,"Startup ecosystems started to emerge in different parts of the world since the 2000s. They normally focus on specific areas and present different characteristics and dynamics. Also, each ecosystem has its own path of evolution over time. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of these ecosystems by taking the New York case study as an example. We show what stages ecosystems pass through, the requirements for each of these phases and why it is possible for many ecosystems to evolve until reaching a self-sustainable level of maturity. This research can bring a better understanding of the evolution of software startup ecosystems and what role their actors play in this development. The results can be used as a basis for ecosystem stakeholders to reflect and act concretely on improving the maturity of their local environments.",Cukier D.; Kon F.; Lyons T.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation/IEEE lnternational Technology Management Conference, ICE/ITMC 2016 - Proceedings",2016-06-01,Baruch College;Universidade de São Paulo,Entrepreneurship ;  Innovation ;  Maturity model ;  New York City ;  Startup ecosystems ;  Startups
Does Lean Startup really work? Foundation for an empirical study,"Lean Startup have been a major influence on how business development has been performed by, and taught to entrepreneurs in our decade. In particular, the training and evaluation of entrepreneurs by public entrepreneurship offices (like Innovation Norway, Danish Growth houses or Innovate UK) often builds on Lean Startup. The main principle is that static business planning should be replaced by a dynamic development, where products, services and business model elements are frequently changed based on constant customer feedback. The Lean Startup principles are widely acknowledged, even if very little empirical data exist to prove their validity. Our ambition is to make a harness that test the business development behavior of a large number of businesses over a long period of time. We want to measure if frequent changes of the business idea, the business model elements, the project management and close interaction with customers really increases the success rate of entrepreneurs. We also want to learn more about the nature of these relations.

The impact of a delayed software project on product launch coordination: A case study,"An increasing number of today's products include software as their key component. This means that more and more product launches are depending on software projects, Which are infamous for delays. While the impacts of delays are well studied in the scope of a software project and the company itself, the impacts on the management of launch activities are not very well understood. This study addresses the gap by an in-depth case study of one delayed software project. The results show that the delays may increase the cost of a product launch, as well as decrease the scope and quality of the launch activities. These impacts are influenced by key personnel's motivational factors, which in turn cause lost working time and postponing the work until it is too late to act as planned.",Rahikkala J.; Hyrynsalmi S.; Seppanen M.; Leppanen V.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation/IEEE lnternational Technology Management Conference, ICE/ITMC 2016 - Proceedings",2016-06-01,Tampere University;Turun yliopisto,Change management ;  Product innovation management ;  Product launch ;  Project delay ;  Software cost estimation ;  Software product management

Measurement of innovation mindset a method and tool within the Berkeley innovation index framework,"The Berkeley Innovation Index (BII) is a concept and an open project offering simple yet powerful ways to measure innovation capability in a holistic sense. Our work is motivated by the fact that if Innovation capability cannot be measured, then it is inherently difficult for any person or organization to improve their ability to be innovative. The approach is also intended to cover various facets of innovation: 1) Strategy and Leadership, 2) Innovation Culture from an Organization's Viewpoint, 3) Organizational Operations and Measures across functions, 4) Mindset: The Innovation DNA of the People, and 5) Tactical measures. In this paper, we focus on one particular facet, which is a person's mindset towards innovation (number 4 above). The work on this facet can be divided in four steps. In this paper we describe BII, the four steps of work, the algorithm, the learning model, and the initial results of the Innovation Mindset Instrument. The tool has been used to conduct a survey on the students attending the Berkeley Method of Entrepreneurship Bootcamp, a 4-day intensive class experience on innovation and entrepreneurship. It can be concluded that by the third day of the class, the innovation mindset levels have increased by half of a standard deviation, and by the final day, the class has increased its Innovation Mindset score by a full standard deviation. The Innovation Mindset score is not a test of knowledge, but instead a test of beliefs about oneself.

The current study investigated this crucial topic, particularly from the perspective of knowledge management, with which business firms encounter concurrent innovation-related cooperation and competition and must address possible conflicts of knowledge sharing and knowledge protection simultaneously.",Wu F.; Wu C.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation/IEEE lnternational Technology Management Conference, ICE/ITMC 2016 - Proceedings",2016-06-01,National Chengchi University,"Co-opetition ;  Competition ;  Cooperation ;  Innovation ;  Knowledgement management ;  Machine tool, Taiwan"
Process innovation through digital services for the seaport of the future,"Logistics largely determines the globalization and has developed from a support function to a core function of economic activities. The optimization along value chains plays an important role for economic success in the international logistics process design. Logistics processes are found on the road, rail, water and in the air - logistics is omnipresent. The traditional logistics processes found in a seaport are subject for change. On the one hand the handling of standardized units such as containers is becoming increasingly important, on the other hand the harbors - especially on the North and Baltic sea - play a strategic role in fulfilling the national and European goals in offshore wind energy. A decisive factor for the competitiveness of the offshore wind industry is the increased industrialization in production and logistics. This paper discusses how such logistics processes can benefit from introducing digital services.",Duin H.; Gorldt C.; Thoben K.; Pawar K.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation/IEEE lnternational Technology Management Conference, ICE/ITMC 2016 - Proceedings",2016-06-01,University of Nottingham;Universität Bremen,Container handling ;  Digital services ;  Digitization ;  Future of ports ;  Offshore wind farm components handling
Understanding museum visitors' experience through an eye-tracking study and a living lab approach,"User-centered and participatory innovation practices like Living-Labs are nowadays increasingly been used to integrate, design and improve users' experience (UX) in different fields. These methods that had emerged from web and mobile design fields can contribute to the UX in several other fields. Museum visitors experience is a field that can benefit from them. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of the museum visitors' experience through the use of tools from UX and usability studies. Among those techniques, field trials studies can help to better understand users' preferences as experience is tested in a real life setting. Exposition curators and managers can then use these understandings to improve visitors' experience. We present a study held at the Museum Aquarium of Nancy-MAN (France). In this study were evaluated visitors' preferences among four different information supports in an exhibition module using a protocol that combines eyes tracking and an after use survey. Results show that interactive supports, as tablets and screens, even if not preferred by the majority of participants, once engaged with these supports, they interact for longer time. Found evidences let us to conclude that supports that are different and uncommon are preferred by most of the participants but they don't keep them engaged for long time.",Morantes P.; Penarete S.; Arbelaez G.; Camargo M.; Dupont L.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation/IEEE lnternational Technology Management Conference, ICE/ITMC 2016 - Proceedings",2016-06-01,ERPI (Équipe de Recherche sur les Processus Innovatifs);Universidad Nacional de Colombia,Eye-tracking ;  Field trials experiments ;  Museology ;  User experience ;  User-centered design
The initial team of a software startup: Narrow-shouldered innovation and broad-shouldered implementation,"Research interest in software startups has been increasing in recent years in parallel with the increasing role of the startup as a source of new, highly innovative business and product ideas. In the early stages of the startup, the initial team plays a key role both in innovativeness and in transforming the idea into a product. The aim of this paper is to study the competencies that are present in the initial teams of software startups. The paper identifies characteristics of the competencies and maps how the competencies and personnel structures of the initial team reflect each other. The findings are presented in a competency distribution map with six high-level competency domains and three personnel categories. The competency map was created by conducting thematic synthesis of an empirical interview data from a sample of different software startups in four European locations. Our results show a strong dominance of the founder in the actions and competencies related to the business and product innovations of startups. The role and competencies of the rest of the initial team fall into the implementation-related work category.",Seppanen P.; Oivo M.; Liukkunen K.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation/IEEE lnternational Technology Management Conference, ICE/ITMC 2016 - Proceedings",2016-06-01,Oulun Yliopisto,Competencies ;  Competency needs ;  Initial team ;  Innovation ;  Software startup
Intrapreneurship: Increasing employees' responsibility for an enhancement of innovation performance,"Because of their positive impact on organisational growth and innovation, intrapreneurship has gained on interest in recent times. While its positive impacts on organisations benefitted from extensive research over the last years, research on the willingness of employees to adopt intrapreneurial behaviour remains low. This short paper therefore aims to give an insight in employees' attitudes that are related to the theories of intrapreneurship. After a brief literature analysis and looking into the possibilities of implementing intrapreneurial behaviour through organisational transformation, the analysis of data furthermore specifies that a majority of questioned employees feels motivated through shaping their organisation's future and that their individual needs are positively related to companies' objectives.",Reuther K.; Schumann C.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation/IEEE lnternational Technology Management Conference, ICE/ITMC 2016 - Proceedings",2016-06-01,"University of the West of Scotland, School of Business & Creative Industries;Westsächsische Hochschule Zwickau (FH)",Intrapreneurship ;  Management of Innovation ;  Organisational Behavior ;  Organisational Transformation
A new perspective on business incubators,"Business Incubators (BIs) play a key role in the growth and support of technology-based startups. They are an important driving force of innovation. Although, a significant amount of research efforts has been paid on the outcome and benefits of business incubators, there is still a scarcity of studies on the role of business incubators in empowering technology-based startups and making them a success. The current paper aims to address this inconclusiveness. As a first step, it explores the supportive activities offered by business incubators. For our research, we use data from eleven interviews with founders of high-tech startups, who received the support of public incubators. Our research methodology follows grounded theory to code and categorize the data. The first result shows the classification of supportive activities of BIs into five categories: (1) networking, (2) monitoring, (3) knowledge development, (4), resource mobilization, and (5) creation of exposure. As a second result, we map the interrelations between the identified activities, and present our conceptual framework. The framework can be considered as a tool to measure the effectiveness of BIs' activities on New Technology-Based Firms (NTBFs). It is illustrated by exploring five propositions. The paper contributes to the development of incubators, and incubator-incubatee impact studies through the lens of resource-based theory. It concludes with recommendations for researchers and practitioners.",Samaeemofrad N.; Van Den Herik J.; Verburg R.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation/IEEE lnternational Technology Management Conference, ICE/ITMC 2016 - Proceedings",2016-06-01,Universiteit Leiden;Delft University of Technology,Actual supportive activities ;  Business Incubators ;  New Technology-Based Firms
Exploring the appropriateness of different immersive environments in the context of an innovation process for smart-cities,"This paper presents an explorative study dedicated to the evaluation of Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR) platforms immersing different stakeholders that have to collaborate within an innovation process in the area of smart cities. A previous study has unveiled the great potential of close-to-real-life immersion perceived by users/citizens in realistic environments that not only fulfil the 'realism' principle of a Living Lab but also greatly contribute to both phenomena of technology acceptance and adoption of the proposed solution. Scholars have previously identified three main factors characterizing an immersive environment: the degree of immersiveness, presence and engagement perceived by users. However, creating close to real-life simulated city environments that provide an appropriate degree of immersiveness, presence and engagement for potential users in the context of urban projects remains a challenge. The traditional working habits of smart cities stakeholders, such as: territorial engineers, town-planners and policy makers, are not prepared for behaving properly in immersive environments. Several experiments were carried out during different events that provided both quantitative and qualitative data through the use of surveys, interviews and observations. For each experiment several VR/AR equipment were used. The findings highlight the complementarity between physical and digital technologies supporting co-creation for smart city projects, and the advantage of enabling experts in a field to discover new technologies. Finally, this study provides valuable elements on how to better support close to real-life simulated city environments while providing a higher level of stakeholders' engagement during the ideation of the co-creation stage of the innovation process towards the realization of smart-cities.",Dupont L.; Morel L.; Pallot M.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation/IEEE lnternational Technology Management Conference, ICE/ITMC 2016 - Proceedings",2016-06-01,ERPI (Équipe de Recherche sur les Processus Innovatifs);Arts et Metiers Institute of Technology,Augmented-reality ;  Co-creation ;  Design ;  Immersive-environment ;  Living-lab ;  Open-innovation ;  User experience ;  User-centered design ;  Virtual-reality
Agreement on the venture's reality presented in business plans: Purifying a multi-dimensional measurement instrument to improve validity and reliability,"The business plan is one of the most frequently available artifacts to innovation intermediaries of technology based ventures' presentations in their early stages [1] [4]. Agreement on the evaluations of venturing projects based on the business plans highly depends on the individual perspective of the readers [5], [6]. One reason is that little empirical proof exists for descriptions in business plans that suggest survival of early-stage technology ventures [7] [9]. We identified descriptions of transaction relations [10] [13] as an anchor of the snapshot model business plan to business reality [13]. In the early-stage, surviving ventures are building transaction relations to human resources, financial resources, and suppliers on the input side, and customers on the output side of the business towards a stronger ego-centric value network [10] [13]. We conceptualized a multidimensional measurement instrument that evaluates the maturity of egocentric value networks based on the transaction relations of different strength categories that are described in business plans of early-stage technology ventures [13]. In this paper, the research design and the instrument are purified to achieve high agreement in the evaluation of a business plan [14] [16]. As a result, we present an overall research design that can reach acceptable quality. The paper so contributes to the literature on business analysis in the early-stage of technology-based ventures and the research technique of content analysis.",Konig M.; Ungerer C.; Buchele R.; Baltes G.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation/IEEE lnternational Technology Management Conference, ICE/ITMC 2016 - Proceedings",2016-06-01,Hochschule Konstanz University of Applied Sciences;Bwcon,Business lifecycle ;  Business plan ;  Content analysis (keywords) ;  Technology transfer ;  Value network

Board interconnections and company performance : AAn analysis of the Finnish game developer companies,"In the world of networked innovation, flows of resources into the organization are emphasized. One special approach of interorganizational flows is board networks or interlocks, which have been widely studied as contributors toward company performance. In this paper, we apply prior research from board interlock SNA as well as prior wider innovation ecosystem research into the case context of Finnish game industry with existing board interlocks. This industry has been very successful, with a turnover of 1.8 Billion Euros in 2014. This paper we explore the role of board interlocks toward the performance of individual companies. We find that 51 percent of the game companies have interlocks. With further analysis we find that even though the descriptive evaluation of data suggest otherwise, there is no statistical support for volume or centrality of networks having positive impact to company performance.",Still K.; Suominen A.; Rilla N.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation/IEEE lnternational Technology Management Conference, ICE/ITMC 2016 - Proceedings",2016-06-01,Teknologian Tutkimuskeskus VTT,Board interlocks ;  Board performance ;  Firm connectedness ;  Social network analysis
Application of artificial neural networks to predict the deflections of reinforced concrete beams,"Nonlinear structural mechanics should be taken into account in the practical design of reinforced concrete structures. Cracking is one of the major sources of nonlinearity. Description of deflection of reinforced concrete elements is a computational problem, mainly because of the difficulties in modelling the nonlinear stress-strain relationship of concrete and steel. In design practise, in accordance with technical rules (e.g., Eurocode 2), a simplified approach for reinforced concrete is used, but the results of simplified calculations differ from the results of experimental studies. Artificial neural network is a versatile modelling tool capable of making predictions of values that are difficult to obtain in numerical analysis. This paper describes the creation and operation of a neural network for making predictions of deflections of reinforced concrete beams at different load levels. In order to obtain a database of results, that is necessary for training and testing the neural network, a research on measurement of deflections in reinforced concrete beams was conducted by the authors in the Certified Research Laboratory of the Building Engineering Institute at Wrocław University of Science and Technology. The use of artificial neural networks is an innovation and an alternative to traditional methods of solving the problem of calculating the deflections of reinforced concrete elements. The results show the effectiveness of using artificial neural network for predicting the deflection of reinforced concrete beams, compared with the results of calculations conducted in accordance with Eurocode 2. The neural network model presented in this paper can acquire new data and be used for further analysis, with availability of more research results.",Kaczmarek M.; Szymańska A.,Journal,Studia Geotechnica et Mechanica,2016-06-01,Politechnika Wrocławska,Artificial neural network ;  Deflection ;  Reinforced concrete beams ;  Research
Coal-fired power in the new industrial development,"Institute of Economics and Industrial Engineering of Siberian Branch of RAS, 17, Lavrentyev Prosp., Akademgorodok, Novosibirsk, 630090, Russian Federation. The role of coal as the driver of innovative electricity generation for the new industrial development is complicated. On the world industrial agenda, coal continues to dominate global power generation due to its nature - significant reserves and well-distributed deposits, stability of production, flexibility of delivery, comparatively easily predicted prices and supply. A significant drawback of coal generation that is connected with the emission of toxic particulars (CO2, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, etc.) can be eliminated by new technologies, i.e. ultra-supercritical, integrated gasification combined cycle, carbon capture and sequestration. Technological inertia and capital-intensive innovation processes determine the power generation as industry with medium-low R&D expenditures, which are roughly 1-2% of the net sales of power companies. World strategic innovators in power industry build up the technological trends of coal generation, however, recent public and private spending on R&D represents only a small fraction of capital, needed for wide scaled deployment of new coal-fired power generation technologies. Plus to that, the significant cash flow from international commercial banks has been directed to finance new coal-fired plants based on traditional old-fashioned technologies with low efficiency and weak environmental standards. Most governments in the world support traditional fossil fuels suppliers by means of energy subsidies. Emerging financial initiatives - green bonds, new financial metric - are aimed at redirecting cash flow towards innovative technologies in power industry. But up to the moment, the amount of money reallocation is small and the pace of training high quality engineers and scientists is slack. Nevertheless, the intensified international cooperation between the largest coal users such as the USA and China makes quite possible the optimistic scenario for the future of a new coal generation. Education, finance and technology are the main factors of strengthening bilateral or multilateral cooperation. Russia has obtained up to the moment, by experts' judgments, well-educated engineers, valuable traditions of scientific schools and research practice in the field of coal power. That bestows Russia good premises for making up international technological consortium with other, rich in coal countries, first of all, China and India.",Gorbacheva N.,Journal,World Economy and International Relations,2016-06-01,Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology,China ;  Coal-fired power ;  Emerging technologies ;  Financing ;  India ;  International cooperation ;  New industrial development ;  R&D expenditures ;  Russia
An investigation into software product innovation: A systematic literature review,"New products enable firms not only to accrue high profits but also to leapfrog competition. Different key activities and processes have been proposed to increase the likelihood of successful product innovation. Software products have different characteristics, which need different treatment than products in other domains. Current research on software innovation is still scattered among different areas. This study accumulates the current knowledge and empirical evidences of software product innovation using a systematic literature review approach, and builds the path for future research in this area. Among others, our findings highlight research gaps, as well as best practices and determinants for software product innovation from the reviewed empirical studies.",Edison H.; Duc A.; Jabangwe R.; Wang X.; Abrahamsson P.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation/IEEE lnternational Technology Management Conference, ICE/ITMC 2016 - Proceedings",2016-06-01,Dundalk Institute of Technology;Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet;Free University of Bozen-Bolzano,Empirical evidence ;  Software product innovation ;  Systematic literature review
Science and technology convergence: with emphasis for nanotechnology-inspired convergence,"Convergence offers a new universe of discovery, innovation, and application opportunities through specific theories, principles, and methods to be implemented in research, education, production, and other societal activities. Using a holistic approach with shared goals, convergence seeks to transcend existing human limitations to achieve improved conditions for work, learning, aging, physical, and cognitive wellness. This paper outlines ten key theories that offer complementary perspectives on this complex dynamic. Principles and methods are proposed to facilitate and enhance science and technology convergence. Several convergence success stories in the first part of the 21st century—including nanotechnology and other emerging technologies—are discussed in parallel with case studies focused on the future.

Evidence-based software portfolio management: A tool description and evaluation,"Context: In this paper we describe and evaluate a tool for Evidence-Based Software Portfolio Management (EBSPM) that we developed over time in close cooperation with software practitioners from The Netherlands and Belgium. Objectives: The goal of the EBSPM-tool is to measure, analyze, and benchmark the performance of interconnected sets of software projects in terms of size, cost, duration, and number of defects, in order to support innovation of a company's software delivery capability. The tool supports building and maintaining a research repository of finalized software projects from different companies, business domains, and delivery approaches. Method: The tool consists of two parts. First, a Research Repository, at this moment holding data of for now 490 finalized software projects, from four different companies. Second, a Performance Dashboard, built from a so-called Cost Duration Matrix. Results: We evaluated the tool by describing its use in two practical applications in case studies in industry. Conclusions: We show that the EBSPM-tool can be used successfully in an industrial context, especially regarding its benchmarking and visualization purposes.",Huijgens H.,Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2016-06-01,Delft University of Technology,Benchmarking ;  EBSPM ;  EBSPM-tool ;  Evidence-based software portfolio management ;  Software portfolio management
Multilayer network planning and operation using open-source tools (Tutorial),"Continuous advances in network technologies challenge network architects in their attempt to foresee what new technologies deserve resources and investments, what existing infrastructure to keep, and their interplay during migration processes. Moreover, topics like energy efficiency, disaster resilience, or SDN/NFV are being intensively considered and investigated during the last years. As a result, R&D efforts have led to a number of solutions. Unfortunately, it is often difficult for operators to reproduce such results on their networks, maybe due to divergent philosophies between commercial planning tools used in the industry and academic tools. A paradigm shift to an open-source view of network planning could emphasize the power of peer-review and transparency to promote innovation at an accelerated pace and lower cost. This tutorial would focus on Net2Plan (http://www.net2plan.com), an open-source tool developed by the authors, and actively used in several courses (>200 students) and research projects since 2012. Built on top of a technology-agnostic multilayer network representation, Net2Plan is designed to assist users in the evaluation of built-in or original user-developed planning algorithms. In addition, users can analyze their designs using either reports or a simulation tool for in-operation scenarios like network resilience, connection-admission-control, time-varying traffic resource allocation, or even combinations of them. Besides, Net2Plan permits applying algorithms to orchestrate OpenFlow-enabled networks interacting with the northbound interface of OpenDaylight. Throughout the tutorial, attendees would have the opportunity to learn about the main features of Net2Plan, also discovering some of its applications. At the end of this tutorial, attendees would be guided through an intensive hands-on case study based on an IP-over-WDM network, e.g., including network dimensioning using built-in or user-developed algorithms, WDM line engineering (e.g., EDFA placement, impairment computations), automatic availability calculation under different failure patterns, and automatic simulation of the effects of time-varying traffic and assessment of energy-efficient switch-off techniques.",Izquierdo-Zaragoza J.; Pavon-Marino P.,Conference Proceeding,"IEEE International Conference on High Performance Switching and Routing, HPSR",2016-06-01,Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena,
The discovery cloud: Accelerating and democratizing research on a global scale,"Modern science and engineering require increasingly sophisticated information technology (IT) for data analysis, simulation, and related tasks. Yet the small to medium laboratories (SMLs) in which the majority of research advances occur increasingly lack the human and financial capital needed to acquire and operate such IT. New methods are needed to provide all researchers with access to state-of-the-art scientific capabilities, regardless of their location and budget. Industry has demonstrated the value of cloud-hosted software-and platform-as-a-service approaches, small businesses that outsource their IT to third-party providers slash costs and accelerate innovation. However, few business cloud services are transferable to science. We thus propose the Discovery Cloud, an ecosystem of new, community-produced services to which SMLs can outsource common activities, from data management and analysis to collaboration and experiment automation. We explain the need for a Discovery Platform to streamline the creation and operation of new and interoperable services, and a Discovery Exchange to facilitate the use and sustainability of Discovery Cloud services. We report on our experiences building early elements of the Discovery Platform in the form of Globus services, and on the experiences of those who have applied those services in innovative applications.",Foster I.; Chard K.; Tuecke S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2016 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering, IC2E 2016: Co-located with the 1st IEEE International Conference on Internet-of-Things Design and Implementation, IoTDI 2016",2016-06-01,"Department of Computer Science, The University of Chicago;The University of Chicago;Argonne National Laboratory",
Technology-based innovations to foster personalized healthy lifestyles and well-being:a targeted review,"Background: New community-based arrangements and novel technologies can empower individuals to be active participants in their health maintenance, enabling people to control and self-regulate their health and wellness and make better health-and lifestyle-related decisions. Mobile sensing technology and health systems responsive to individual profiles combined with cloud computing can expand innovation for new types of interoperable services that are consumer-oriented and community-based. This could fuel a paradigm shift in the way health care can be, or should be, provided and received, while lessening the burden on exhausted health and social care systems. Objective: Our goal is to identify and discuss the main scientific and engineering challenges that need to be successfully addressed in delivering state-of-the-art, ubiquitous eHealth and mHealth services, including citizen-centered wellness management services, and reposition their role and potential within a broader context of diverse sociotechnical drivers, agents, and stakeholders. Methods: We review the state-of-the-art relevant to the development and implementation of eHealth and mHealth services in critical domains. We identify and discuss scientific, engineering, and implementation-related challenges that need to be overcome to move research, development, and the market forward. Results: Several important advances have been identified in the fields of systems for personalized health monitoring, such as smartphone platforms and intelligent ubiquitous services. Sensors embedded in smartphones and clothes are making the unobtrusive recognition of physical activity, behavior, and lifestyle possible, and thus the deployment of platforms for health assistance and citizen empowerment. Similarly, significant advances are observed in the domain of infrastructure supporting services. Still, many technical problems remain to be solved, combined with no less challenging issues related to security, privacy, trust, and organizational dynamics. Conclusions: Delivering innovative ubiquitous eHealth and mHealth services, including citizen-centered wellness and lifestyle management services, goes well beyond the development of technical solutions. For the large-scale information and communication technology-supported adoption of healthier lifestyles to take place, crucial innovations are needed in the process of making and deploying usable empowering end-user services that are trusted and user-acceptable. Such innovations require multidomain, multilevel, transdisciplinary work, grounded in theory but driven by citizens' and health care professionals' needs, expectations, and capabilities and matched by business ability to bring innovation to the market.",Spanakis E.; Santana S.; Tsiknakis M.; Marias K.; Sakkalis V.; Teixeira A.; Janssen J.; De Jong H.; Tziraki C.,Journal,Journal of Medical Internet Research,2016-06-01,Instituto de Engenharia Electrónica e Telemática de Aveiro;Institute of Computer Science;Hellenic Mediterranean University;Universidade de Aveiro;Stanford University;Sense Health;ASK Community Systems GmbH;Melabev Community Elders Care Research Department,Cloud computing ;  eHealth ;  Health behavior ;  Health promotion ;  Interoperability ;  Lifestyle ;  mHealth ;  Personalized health monitoring ;  Persuasive technologies ;  Wellness programs
Research on knowledge support technology for product innovation design based on quality function knowledge deployment,"Based on the analysis of the relationship between the process of product innovation design and knowledge, this article proposes a theoretical model of quality function knowledge deployment. In order to link up the product innovation design and the knowledge required by the designer, the iterative method of quality function knowledge deployment is refined, as well as the knowledge retrieval model and knowledge support model based on quality function knowledge deployment are established. In the whole life cycle of product design, in view of the different requirements for knowledge in conceptual design stage, components' configuration stage, process planning stage, and production planning stage, the quality function knowledge deployment model could link up the required knowledge with the engineering characteristics, component characteristics, process characteristics, and production characteristics in the four stages using the mapping relationship between the function characteristics and the knowledge and help the designer to track the required knowledge for realizing product innovation design.

Financialization as 'investification': Innovation work and portfolio work organization,"The paper explores the effects of financialization on the organization of innovation work in non-financial corporations. Evidence from a car company's research & development division suggests that a new form of work organization is emerging, characterized by two components: The quasi-permanent utilization of external workers from engineering firms in the core areas of R&D, and a variable division of work between internal and external employees. Using a framework inspired by the sociology of conventions the analysis reveals that underlying the emergent portfolio work organization is a new taxonomy of work which itself is the result of an hitherto undescribed effect of financialization, namely the 'investification' of organizational decisions: increasingly more internal decisions are framed as investments and evaluated according to their returns. This development is exemplified by the objective of the new organization of work, which is to assign only those tasks to the corporation's core employees which are expected to increase its financial value.",Holst H.,Journal,Zeitschrift fur Soziologie,2016-06-01,Osnabrück University,Externalization ;  Fincancialization ;  Research & Development. ;  Sociology of Conventions ;  Sociology of Economy ;  Sociology of Organization ;  Sociology of Work
Angiogenic potential of extracellular matrix of human amniotic membrane,"Combination between tissue engineering and other fields has brought an innovation in the area of regenerative medicine which ultimate aims are to repair, improve, and produce a good tissue construct. The availability of many types of scaffold, both synthetically and naturally have developed into many outstanding end products that have achieved the general objective in tissue engineering. Interestingly, most of this scaffold emulates extracellular matrix (ECM) characteristics. Therefore, ECM component sparks an interest to be explored and manipulated. The ECM featured in human amniotic membrane (HAM) provides a suitable niche for the cells to adhere, grow, proliferate, migrate and differentiate, and could possibly contribute to the production of angiogenic micro-environment indirectly. Previously, HAM scaffold has been widely used to accelerate wound healing, treat bone related and ocular diseases, and involved in cardiovascular repair. Also, it has been used in the angiogenicity study, but with a different technical approach. In addition, both side of HAM could be used in cellularised and decellularised conditions depending on the objectives of a particular research. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to investigate the behavior of ECM components especially on the stromal side of HAM and further explore the angiogenic potential exhibited by this scaffold.",Hashim S.; Yusof M.; Zahari W.; Noordin K.; Kannan T.; Hamid S.; Mokhtar K.; Ahmad A.,Journal,Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine,2016-06-01,"International Islamic University Malaysia, Kulliyyah of Dentistry;Universiti Sains Malaysia, Health Campus;School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia",Angiogenic ;  Extracellular matrix ;  Human amniotic membrane ;  Tissue engineering
A CRISPR path to engineering new genetic mouse models for cardiovascular research,"Previous efforts to target the mouse genome for the addition, subtraction, or substitution of biologically informative sequences required complex vector design and a series of arduous steps only a handful of laboratories could master. The facile and inexpensive clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) method has now superseded traditional means of genome modification such that virtually any laboratory can quickly assemble reagents for developing new mouse models for cardiovascular research. Here, we briefly review the history of CRISPR in prokaryotes, highlighting major discoveries leading to its formulation for genome modification in the animal kingdom. Core components of CRISPR technology are reviewed and updated. Practical pointers for 2-component and 3-component CRISPR editing are summarized with many applications in mice including frameshift mutations, deletion of enhancers and noncoding genes, nucleotide substitution of protein-coding and gene regulatory sequences, incorporation of loxP sites for conditional gene inactivation, and epitope tag integration. Genotyping strategies are presented and topics of genetic mosaicism and inadvertent targeting discussed. Finally, clinical applications and ethical considerations are addressed as the biomedical community eagerly embraces this astonishing innovation in genome editing to tackle previously intractable questions.",Miano J.; Zhu Q.; Lowenstein C.,Journal,"Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology",2016-06-01,Massachusetts General Hospital;University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry,epitope ;  frameshift mutation ;  genetics ;  genome editing ;  genotype ;  nucleotide
"The impact of organizational culture on Concurrent Engineering, Design-for-Safety, and product safety performance","This paper empirically extends the research on the relationships between organizational culture, new product development (NPD) practices, and product safety performance (PSP). Using Schein's conceptualization of culture (i.e., underlying assumptions, espoused values, and artifacts), we build and test a model among five variables: top management commitment to safety (MCS), group level product safety culture (PSC) at NPD, Concurrent Engineering (CE), Design-for-Safety (DFS), and product safety performance. We propose that the underlying assumption of safety first affects the espoused values (group level product safety culture at NPD) and artifacts of organizational culture (Concurrent Engineering and Design-for-Safety); espoused value influences artifacts; and artifacts impact product safety performance. These hypotheses are tested by structural analyses of 255 survey responses collected from 126 firms in the juvenile product sector. While management commitment to safety, product safety culture, and Design-for-Safety are significant product safety predictors, as expected, Concurrent Engineering has no significant direct effect on product safety.

Interdependences in the intrafirm diffusion of technological innovations: Confronting the rational and social accounts of diffusion,"This article investigates the intrafirm diffusion of technological innovations, and the interdependences that exist among rival firms in this process. Previous research has offered two potential explanations for these interdependences: Social accounts, in which they result from institutional pressures, and rational accounts, in which firms are interdependent as a result of how adoption by rivals affects expectations about the profitability of the technology. The article offers two contributions. First, we propose a competitive interaction mechanism that is consistent with the fundamentals of rational accounts of diffusion. Second, the empirical analysis shows the dominance of the proposed rational mechanism over social accounts of innovation diffusion in the generation of interdependences in the process of intrafirm diffusion.",Fuentelsaz L.; Gómez J.; Palomas S.,Journal,Research Policy,2016-06-01,Universidad de Zaragoza;Universidad de La Rioja,Competitive pressure ;  Intrafirm diffusion ;  Rational accounts ;  Saturation effect ;  Social accounts
The EPSRC’s Policy of Responsible Innovation from a Trading Zones Perspective,"Responsible innovation (RI) is gathering momentum as an academic and policy debate linking science and society. Advocates of RI in research policy argue that scientific research should be opened up at an early stage so that many actors and issues can steer innovation trajectories. If this is done, they suggest, new technologies will be more responsible in different ways, better aligned with what society wants, and mistakes of the past will be avoided. This paper analyses the dynamics of RI in policy and practice and makes recommendations for future development. More specifically, we draw on the theory of ‘trading zones’ developed by Peter Galison and use it to analyse two related processes: (i) the development and inclusion of RI in research policy at the UK’s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC); (ii) the implementation of RI in relation to the Stratospheric Particle Injection for Climate Engineering (SPICE) project. Our analysis reveals an RI trading zone comprised of three quasi-autonomous traditions of the research domain – applied science, social science and research policy. It also shows how language and expertise are linking and coordinating these traditions in ways shaped by local conditions and the wider context of research. Building on such insights, we argue that a sensible goal for RI policy and practice at this stage is better local coordination of those involved and we suggest ways how this might be achieved.",Murphy J.; Parry S.; Walls J.,Journal,Minerva,2016-06-01,The University of Edinburgh;University of Glasgow,EPSRC ;  Expertise ;  Geoengineering ;  Language ;  Responsible innovation ;  Trading zone
Conceptualizing organizational innovation: The case of the Brazilian software industry,"This paper presents and tests a conceptual model that explains the innovation practices and innovation outcomes in Brazilian software firms. In terms of internal and external innovation capabilities, the ability to manage the relationship between people and their organizational contexts plays an important role in organizational innovation. Based on these results, we propose that the disparities between software firms in building organizational innovation can be attributed, in part, to differences in their internal capabilities. The paper aims at encouraging and supporting managers to develop internal capabilities as a means of effectively leveraging the internally and externally distributed knowledge essential to innovation development.",De Souza Bermejo P.; Tonelli A.; Galliers R.; Oliveira T.; Zambalde A.,Journal,Information and Management,2016-06-01,"Loughborough University, School of Business and Economics;NOVA Information Management School, Universidade Nova de Lisboa;Bentley University;Centro Federal de Educacao Tecnologica de Minas Gerais;Ministry of Education Brazil;Universidade Federal de Lavras",Development processes ;  Innovation management ;  Open innovation practices ;  Partial least square (PLS) ;  People capabilities ;  Survey research
What do patent-based measures tell us about product commercialization? Evidence from the pharmaceutical industry,"Patent-based measures are frequently used as indicators in empirical research on innovation and technological change. Currently, there is little evidence as to what extent patent-based indicators relate to product market outcomes. Using a unique dataset that links outcomes from product commercialization in the pharmaceutical industry with detailed patent data, we relate patent-based indicators that capture either an invention's value or the uncertainty surrounding the patenting process to the outcomes of the product development process. Our findings suggest that the speed of commercialization increases with value but reduces with uncertainty. Using a variety of alternative indicators we derive implications for the use and the proper interpretation of individual measures. Moreover, our study has broader implications as it highlights the detrimental effect of uncertainty on the speed of innovation.",Wagner S.; Wakeman S.,Journal,Research Policy,2016-06-01,ESMT Berlin;New Zealand Productivity Commission,Drug development ;  Patent indicators ;  Patent system ;  Pharmaceutical industry ;  Product commercialization
"A Comprehensive Review on Controlled Synthesis of Long-Chain Branched Polyolefins: Part 1, Single Catalyst Systems","Polyolefins (POs) are the largest polymer product in the world. The innovation in converting commodity olefin monomers to highly value added high-performance POs has been and will continue to be a major theme in both academic research and industry practice. The excellent properties of POs can be achieved through precise engineering of their chain architectures, which largely involves control of the chain branching structures. Long-chain branching is one of the most important parameters in the aspect of various chain branching structures. A huge amount of literatures have been reported to achieve better control of long-chain branched structures over the last two decades. Recently, good effort has been made in reviewing all the major literatures and summarizing the catalytic systems and synthetic strategies for the controlled synthesis of long-chain branched POs. This paper represents the first of the series, that is, controlled synthesis of long-chain branched POs via single catalyst systems.

Social innovation with open source software: User engagement and development challenges in India,"A diverse range of innovative solutions based on Free-and-Open-Source Software (FOSS) have been developed for marginalized communities in developing countries. It has been suggested that such small-scale and home-grown solutions (e.g. mobile phone apps), usually championed by social enterprises (SEs), are more likely to introduce pro-poor change than infrastructure heavy ICT initiatives designed by state and other international actors. In the Indian context, FOSS-based social innovations (SIs) introduced by SEs are helping poor communities tackle previously thought-to-be unresolvable socio-economic problems. An interesting question, therefore, would be: in what ways is the SE model and approach uniquely equipped to develop FOSS-based SIs that deliver pro-poor change? The empirical component of the research attempts to shed light on this question by uncovering the nuts and bolts of the development methodology deployed by an SE during the coding and launch of an FOSS-based SI. Findings highlight the significant role of the founder's social vision; the challenges of accurately capturing and translating to software developers the nature and nuance of social problems; and, the incumbent issues in putting together a methodology that creates active user engagement throughout the software development process, overcoming difficult barriers such as language and culture.",Bhatt P.; Ahmad A.; Roomi M.,Journal,Technovation,2016-06-01,Warwick Manufacturing Group;Birmingham City Business School;Cranfield School of Management,Developing country ;  Free software ;  ICT ;  India ;  Open source software ;  Social change ;  Social innovation ;  Technology policy
"Food Engineering at Multiple Scales: Case Studies, Challenges and the Future—A European Perspective","A selection of Food Engineering research including food structure engineering, novel emulsification processes, liquid and dry fractionation, Food Engineering challenges and research with comments on European Food Engineering education is covered. Food structure engineering is discussed by using structure formation in freezing and dehydration processes as examples for mixing of water as powder and encapsulation and protection of sensitive active components. Furthermore, a strength parameter is defined for the quantification of material properties in dehydration and storage. Methods to produce uniform emulsion droplets in membrane emulsification are presented as well as the use of whey protein fibrils in layer-by-layer interface engineering for encapsulates. Emulsion particles may also be produced to act as multiple reactors for food applications. Future Food Engineering must provide solutions for sustainable food systems and provide technologies allowing energy and water efficiency as well as waste recycling. Dry fractionation provides a novel solution for an energy and water saving separation process applicable to protein purification. Magnetic separation of particles advances protein recovery from wastewater streams. Food Engineering research is moving toward manufacturing of tailor-made foods, sustainable use of resources and research at disciplinary interfaces. Modern food engineers contribute to innovations in food processing methods and utilization of structure–property relationships and reverse engineering principles for systematic use of information of consumer needs to process innovation. Food structure engineering, emulsion engineering, micro- and nanotechnologies, and sustainability of food processing are examples of significant areas of Food Engineering research and innovation. These areas will contribute to future Food Engineering and novel food processes to be adapted by the food industry, including process and product development to achieve improvements in public health and quality of life.

Geoengineering as Collective Experimentation,"Geoengineering is defined as the ‘deliberate and large-scale intervention in the Earth’s climatic system with the aim of reducing global warming’. The technological proposals for doing this are highly speculative. Research is at an early stage, but there is a strong consensus that technologies would, if realisable, have profound and surprising ramifications. Geoengineering would seem to be an archetype of technology as social experiment, blurring lines that separate research from deployment and scientific knowledge from technological artefacts. Looking into the experimental systems of geoengineering, we can see the negotiation of what is known and unknown. The paper argues that, in renegotiating such systems, we can approach a new mode of governance—collective experimentation. This has important ramifications not just for how we imagine future geoengineering technologies, but also for how we govern geoengineering experiments currently under discussion.",Stilgoe J.,Journal,Science and Engineering Ethics,2016-06-01,University College London,Climate engineering ;  Collective experimentation ;  Geoengineering ;  Governance ;  Responsible research and innovation
New materials for thermal energy storage in concentrated solar power plants,"Solar Thermal Electricity (STE) is an important alternative to PV electricity production, not only because it is getting more cost competitive with the continuous growth in installed capacity, engineering and associated innovations, but also, because of its unique dispatch ability advantage as a result of the already well established 2-tank energy storage using molten salts (MS). In recent years, research has been performed, on direct MS systems, to which features like modularity and combinations with other (solid) thermal storage materials are considered with the goal of achieving lower investment cost. Several alternative materials and systems have been studied. In this research, storage materials were identified with thermo-physical data being presented for different rocks (e.g. quartzite), super concrete, and other appropriate solid materials. Among the new materials being proposed like rocks from old quarries, an interesting option is the incorporation of solid waste material from old mines belonging to the Iberian Pyritic Belt. These are currently handled as byproducts of past mine activity, and can potentially constitute an environmental hazard due to their chemical (metal) content. This paper presents these materials, as part of a broad study to improve the current concept of solar energy storage for STE plants, and additionally presents a potentially valuable solution for environmental protection related to re-use of mining waste.",Guerreiro L.; Collares-Pereira M.,Conference Proceeding,AIP Conference Proceedings,2016-05-31,University of Évora,

Requirements prioritization to develop automated support for adopting EHRS,"Electronic health record systems (EHRS) are an important technology for providing quality and low cost health care services. Nevertheless, EHRS has a limited adoption level, which negatively affects the provision of health care services. Although it has studied the problem of EHRS' adoption, it has been analyzed from a user perspective, but it is also important a software engineering perspective about the software artifacts for promoting the adoption of EHRS. A software engineering perspective about requirements of automatic support for assisting the adoption of EHRS would reveal a unified point of view about software models for facilitating a greater likelihood of EHRS adoption.

A Living Lab model for user driven innovation in urban communities,"Many innovative information communication technology (ICT) products and services that fail are not for lack of advanced technology but because of a failure to understand real users' needs. The users' experiences and feedbacks on new applications have become important components in the development of new ICT products and services. Therefore, an emperical approach to identify users' needs and underpin the product requirements can support the development of new ICT services significantly.

Use of body knowledge and cloud computing tools to develop software projects based in innovation,"A Body of Knowledge (BOK) is a term used to represent the complete set of concepts, terms, and activities that make up a professional domain. It encompasses the core teaching skills and research in a field or industry [13]. One of the main concerns of the software industry is to develop the talent of its human resources since the quality and innovation of its products and services depend of a great extent on the Knowledge, the ability, and the talent of technical engineers. In the educational area the used of BOK and Cloud Computing Tools are becoming the best way to provide solutions that meet the current need for greater collaboration between business, industry, education, and society; for this reason, the development of software products based in innovation is important for the professional life of a software engineering, since it leads to transform routine tasks into automated tasks; in the same way, it allows to manage processes focused on aligning services of Information Technology (IT) to the needs of companies with an emphasis on the benefits that the final customer added may perceive to the factor of I+D+I in order to create an innovative product.

The need for innovation management and decision guidance in sustainable process design,"The role of engineering science is to generate step changing technological solutions, leading to paradigm-shifts in innovation. But today, the path from discovery to innovation, and from innovation to industrial uptake has become more convoluted: the increased understanding of the wider impacts of technologies on environment and society has led to more complex and strict regulatory frameworks. New technological solutions must address a progressively larger number of simultaneous goals, among them is the contribution of technologies to sustainable development. To facilitate the success of translation of novel technologies into innovation and industrial adoption within Europe, the authors advocate an innovation management and a new decision-making approach, which promotes holistic understanding of economic, environmental and societal challenges that a new technology must respond to. The MEASURE approach was developed based on experiences in sustainability assessment and innovation management within previous collaborative projects, and the outcomes of two stakeholder workshops. It allows comparison of alternative solutions, understanding of their benefits and drawbacks, as well as the evaluation of the (remaining) distance to a defined target and, as a result, robust holistic decision-making for innovative sustainable process design. We propose an iterative stage-and-gate approach coupled with sustainability assessment and multi-criteria decision analysis. The paper exemplifies how development teams could set their own most informative criteria, the necessary gates and key targets. It is mainly intended to support technology-driven collaborative research projects between industry and academia within the European Horizon 2020 framework programme, as being an integral part of the Innovation Union Flagship Initiative.",Kralisch D.; Ott D.; Lapkin A.; Yaseneva P.; De Soete W.; Jones M.; Minkov N.; Finkbeiner M.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2016-05-18,Universiteit Gent;University of Cambridge;Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena;Technische Universität Berlin;The University of Manchester,Decision guidance ;  Horizon 2020 ;  Innovation management ;  Process design ;  Stage-and-gate ;  Sustainability assessment
Adding value to acoustic data sets in the offshore oil and gas industry by innovative processing and data integration techniques,"Among the acoustic methods used in ocean and marine geography investigations, the multibeam echo sounder was the product most affected by technological developments in the recent decades. With computers increasing their capabilities of processing, and new complex beam forming algorithms the acoustic signals returned now have excellent ranges and spatial resolutions. The possibility to digitally process these acoustic signals have allowed several other innovations such as the integration of various research methodologies into a single product and expanded the marine environment research possibilities by using the same mechanical and electronic sensor construction. The signals collected by multibeam echo sounders now allow identifying the facies analysis of the seabed, oceanographic features in the water column and even improvements in the sub-bottom profiler's performance. The hydrographic survey vessel FSSV Fugro Brasilis, provides a great case study of these echo sounders capabilities. With modern sensors, mounted in a ""gondola"", 1 meter below the keel, away from the turbulence, aeration and laminar flow, minimizing noise and allowing the processing of low intensity return signals, this vessel exemplifies the installation of a complete system for technological hydrographic surveys down to 7.000m. The arrangement includes two multibeam echo sounders, a Kongsberg EM2040 for shallow water and an EM302 for deep waters, and also a sub-bottom profiler SBP300 sharing the multibeam reception transducers in order to observe the seabed sediment layers with maximum contrast and reflectivity. Part of the development and results evolution obtained passes through the data processing techniques applied to digital signals, which in this case use the processing software Fugro Starfix and Caris. Commercial programs like Caris HIPS and SIPS, make a more pragmatic approach. Naturally, they are in constant contact with the manufacturers from the most commercial relevant equipment and stay up to date in the digital signal processing techniques. Due to this monitoring of the new technologies, Caris HIPS and SIPS are the most suitable software for processing the water column and backscatter data. With the advance of technology, the number of products increases, not only restricted to the accurate achievement of bathymetry, but also enabling the integration of different techniques in order to provide more information in a single product. One of the ways found to increase the investigations quality at sea is processing of the water column data integrated with the bathymetry. This technique enables the research of outline structures in the ocean environment, such as hot springs and gas exudation. The combination of these bathymetric, facies analysis and seabed characterization information through the backscatter and high acoustic contrast aquatic structures allows a presentation of integrated and complete results. With these new technological developments, understanding of oceanic processes is more detailed, supporting academic research and engineering works.",Redusino M.; Belligotti F.; Tozzi H.; Jaques G.,Conference Proceeding,"2015 IEEE/OES Acoustics in Underwater Geosciences Symposium, RIO Acoustics 2015",2016-05-18,Fugro,bathymetry ;  habitats ;  multibeam ;  outcrops ;  seeps
"Using acoustics for the Monitoring, Measurement and Verification (MMV) of offshore carbon capture and storage (CCS) sites","We are all faced with a difficult dilemma. If we are to subscribe to the findings of climate change science then within a decade we must first stop the rise in global carbon dioxide emissions and then in the years to come, emissions must fall. If global economies continue to grow, then we will need more energy and as a consequence will emit more greenhouse gases, unless we get cleverer with our engineering. In the UK, carbon capture with offshore storage will play a vital role in helping us solve this problem. It is the only technology that can turn high carbon fuels into genuinely low carbon electricity and is viewed as a critical technology to develop. As part of a larger £1Bn programme the UK has a £125 million cross-government carbon capture and storage research, development and innovation programme with projects running out to 2018. The paper will address the role of both passive and active acoustics for the wide area Monitoring, Measurement and Verification (MMV) of carbon dioxide leaking from the seabed and infrastructure being conducted as a UK pilot programme. Whilst it will predominantly address shallow water operations in the North Sea, it will address the differing challenges of detecting leaking CO2 in deeper water.

An approach to conceptual and embodiment design within a new product development lifecycle framework,"The design of new innovative products is the result of an accurate and precise management of knowledge sources all over its life cycle, such as technology, market, competitors and suppliers. The work contributes with a framework that shows how the knowledge sources influence in the state-of-the-art and market needs so that they become opportunities for innovating products addressing the whole product life cycle. It provides a systematic path from the early generation of ideas to the production of a new product proposal. Through a deep analysis of previous research works of new product innovation life cycle development frameworks and linking it with knowledge management, strategic planning and scorecards, we came out with a structured contribution. The result considers the concurrent activities and its relationships all the way through the product life cycle that can help in creativity and innovation, combined with a process management proposal. Managing the sources of knowledge in highly dynamic markets and technologies is one of the major difficulties involved in innovative products design and development. The emerging knowledge from external sources is confronted with organisation internal knowledge and experience in order to achieve the first product correct.",Vila C.; Albiñana J.,Journal,International Journal of Production Research,2016-05-18,Universidad Jaume I,collaborative engineering ;  innovation management ;  knowledge management ;  product life cycle management ;  production modelling
How do free/open source developers pick their tools?: A Delphi study of the Debian project,"Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) has come to play a critical role in the global software industry. Organizations are widely adopting FOSS and interacting with open source communities, and hence organizations have a considerable interest in seeing these communities flourishing. Little research has focused on the tools used to develop that software. Given the absence of formal mandate that would appear in traditional organizations, an open question is what influences a FOSS contributor's decision to adopt a tool and how workflows get established in FOSS teams. In this paper we report on a Delphi study conducted in the Debian Project, one of the largest FOSS projects. Drawing from data collected in three phases from a panel of 21 carefully selected and well-informed participants, we identified 15 factors that affect decisions to adopt tools and relate those to existing models of innovation and diffusion.",Krafft M.; Stol K.; Fitzgerald B.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering,2016-05-14,University of Limerick;Debian Developer,Delphi study ;  Free/open source software ;  Qualitative study ;  Tools
Aligning healthcare innovation and software requirements through design thinking,"In recent years, there has been significant growth in software companies across the healthcare sector developing new technologies to improve healthcare delivery and services. This has given rise to the emergence of Connected Health - a new model for healthcare management. This also places considerable emphasis on the process of software development in supporting Connected Health. In addition, it highlights the growing reliance and trust we place on software to support healthcare decisions. However, unlike many other sectors, such as business and education, failure to align healthcare needs with software requirements can have devastating consequences on people's health and potentially cause death. Our research and experience with healthcare companies confirms the need to establish a Connected Health Innovation Framework using Design Thinking principles to a) support software developers in clearly identifying healthcare requirements and b) extend and enrich traditional software requirements gathering techniques. This paper presents an e-pharmacy case study and describes the impact this approach has within a Connected Health context.",Carroll N.; Richardson I.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - International Workshop on Software Engineering in Healthcare Systems, SEHS 2016",2016-05-14,University of Limerick,Connected Health ;  Design Thinking ;  E-pharmacy ;  Healthcare Innovation ;  Software Requirements
Reconstituting the utopian vision of making: HCI after technosolutionism,"HCI research has both endorsed ""making"" for its innovation and democratization capacity and critiqued its underlying technosolutionism, i.e., the idea that technology provides solutions to complex social problems. This paper offers a reflexive-interventionist approach that simultaneously takes seriously the critiques of making's claims as technosolutionist while also embracing its utopian project as worth reconstituting in broader sociopolitical terms. It applies anthropological theory of the global and feministutopianism to the analysis of findings from research on making cultures in Taiwan and China. More specifically, the paper provides ethnographic snippets of utopian glimmers in order to speculatively imagine and explore alternative futures of making worth pursuing, and in so doing reconstitute the utopian vision of making.",Lindtner S.; Bardzell S.; Bardzell J.,Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2016-05-07,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor;Indiana University Bloomington",Capitalism ;  China ;  Diy ;  HCI ;  Innovation ;  Maker movement ;  Making ;  Neoliberalism ;  Policy ;  Taiwan ;  Utopianism
"Design(ing) 'here' and 'there': Tech entrepreneurs, global markets, and reflexivity in design processes","HCI shapes in important ways dominant notions of what counts as innovation and where (good) design is located. In this paper, we argue for the continuous expansion of the body of critical and reflexive work that asks both researcher and designer to reflect on their values of design in the world. Drawing from ethnographic research in Accra, Ghana and Shenzhen, China, we illustrate how design is as much about making artifacts as it is about producing national identity, reputation, and economic gain. Technology entrepreneurs take from and resist the discourse of their cities as emerging sites of Silicon-Valley type innovation. They render the narrative of ""catching up with the west"" overly simplistic, ahistorical and blind to situated practices of design. This view, we argue, is critical for interrogating our views of design especially as it becomes more central in the contemporary global economy.",Avle S.; Lindtner S.,Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2016-05-07,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",Africa ;  China ;  Design ;  Designing ;  Global south ;  Making ;  Participation ;  Production

"Boundary troubles: Here, there, design, make, research","We stage a dialogue between two areas of growing interest in HCI: making cultures and research through design. Both have only recently gained momentum, and so each of their proponents are demarcating-often too sharply-who and what is to be included in their programs to legitimate their work as a concern of and contribution to HCI. Drawing from diverse engagements with making and research through design, the panelists and discussant will explore positions concerning the relationship between research, design, and making.

Influence of fire barriers on fire performance of facades with combustible insulation,"In today's modern society sustainability has become a key driver for innovation. Sustainability in buildings is, or at least it should be, strongly interconnected with energy efficiency and fire safety. Unfortunately, cases of fires in buildings all over the world are a wakeup call to start thinking of fire safety as an inevitable part of energy efficiency in buildings. Thermally enhanced building envelopes, due to materials used, can represent significantly increased fire load on façades. To determine their fire performance, it is necessary to move on from material level to the whole building level, i.e. full scale tests. This paper presents findings from comprehensive research on influence of fire barrier on fire performance of External Thermal Insulation Composite System - ETICS with combustible thermal insulation. To confirm findings, tests on identical ETICS systems were conducted in March 2014 and May 2014.",Bjegovic D.; Pecur I.; Messerschmidt B.; Milovanovic B.; Alagusic M.,Conference Proceeding,MATEC Web of Conferences,2016-05-04,"Sveučilište u Zagrebu, Gradevinski Fakultet;Fire Safe Europe",
Innovation science: between models and machines,"Academic scientists are increasingly required to acquire industry funding, which affects the scope and purpose of their research. In Denmark, Mode 2 inflected ideas have turned universities’ research toward industrial application where the fabrication of ‘robust knowledge’ is tied to commercial innovation. By analyzing the representative modeling of theoretical physicists that aided the implementation of new control solutions, this paper investigates how Mode 2 challenged traditional disciplinary boundaries between engineering and physics. The paper thus presents a case of non-engineers’ move toward ‘engineering’ from outside the disciplinary boundary of engineering. The physicists’ preference for theoretical rigor resulted in models that despite not being validated with production data were useful to the factory. Questions are raised about the challenges that the physicists’ normative baggage entailed when they engaged in commercial application. The case signifies how Mode 2 inspired neoliberal science policy constitutes a new competitive market for the application of science and illuminate how theoretical physics was translated into a service for commercial innovation. In the process, physics, the identities of the physicists, the factory and its process control converged around shared success criteria and thus formed a new domain of work that I conceptualize as innovation science. The case demonstrates some of the demarcation challenges associated with the political reframing of science and the work it takes for science and non-science to develop beneficiary relationships, which translate into new challenges and potential applications for engineering.",Juhl J.,Journal,Engineering Studies,2016-05-03,Harvard University,boundary-work ;  engineering practice ;  Innovation science ;  Mode 2 ;  science policy ;  theoretical physics
Agile manufacturing practices for new product development: Industrial case studies,"Purpose-For decades multiple management philosophies directed toward lean production and mass were assumed as to respond to process inefficiencies and rampant consumerism, optimizing operation costs. However, new customization and flexible productions philosophies have been gaining ground in some industries, such as the agile manufacturing. From a literature review that addresses the history of this philosophy, it is clear that agile manufacturing is not fully comprehended, with very scarce information about practical cases. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach-In this paper the authors describe an exploratory methodology approach, with three semi-structured case study interviews. The goal is to study which of agile manufacturing practices are being applied in the studied companies and what is the perceived effect that these have on operational performance. Sincemost of these companies develop highly customized products, the role of agility on new product development can have a huge impact on their operational performance. Findings-Agile manufacturing is not yet a widespread philosophy of managing for the companies studied, being virtually unknown as a global concept. However, it was found that many of the practices of agile manufacturing are already implemented in these companies without association with this philosophy. It was also concluded, by the finding through respondents opinions, that agile practices contribute positively to the studied companies operating performance. Originality/value-The novelty of this research derives from observation of agile manufacturing practices in SMEs. This research is useful to SMEs implementing agile manufacturing principles.",Leite M.; Braz V.,Journal,Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management,2016-05-03,Iscte Business School;Instituto de Engenharia Mecânica;ISEG Lisbon School of Economics and Management,Agile manufacturing ;  Engineering design ;  Product development ;  Product innovation ;  Product strategy ;  Small-and medium-sized enterprises
From concept to reality in implementing the Knowledge Triangle,"The concept of Knowledge Triangle (KT) links together research, education and innovation and replaces the traditional ‘one way’ flow of knowledge, essentially from research to education, by a ‘both ways’ circular motion between all the corners of a triangle that, besides research and education, also includes innovation, the ‘poor relation’ of many universities. What are the main issues – barriers and drivers – and what could be done in order to make the concept of KT a strong reality in engineering education? In this paper, the authors intend to bring some answers by analysing three cases coming from actors operating at the three corners of the KT: students, academic staff and engineers in industry.",Sjoer E.; Nørgaard B.; Goossens M.,Journal,European Journal of Engineering Education,2016-05-03,"Faculteit Techniek, Bestuur en Management, TU Delft;The Hague University of Applied Sciences;Aalborg University;European Society for Engineers and Industrialists (SEII)",cognitive process ;  engineering education ;  innovation ;  Knowledge Triangle ;  PhD in industry ;  role of university

Business acceleration at scale: An interview with Sramana Mitra,"Sramana Mitra, a serial entrepreneur, author and mentor, and founder of the virtual startup incubator One Million by One Million, talks about democratizing innovation through education and mentoring. She observes that numerous ideas could not be considered because entrepreneurs get discouraged. They spend months persuading and getting refused and rejected; they spend all their energy, all their runway seeking funding. That results in a high proportion of infant entrepreneurial mortality. If we train entrepreneurs to focus on the right things, on customers, on revenues, and on profits, and help them understand that venture financing is optional, then we can reduce that infant entrepreneurial mortality significantly. Sramana Mitra seeks to broaden the reach of innovation by providing an MBA in entrepreneurship? that teaches potential innovators how to bootstrap a company without venture capital support. Her analysis of the market was that the biggest value we can provide to entrepreneurs as an incubator or accelerator is education.

The focus question and business model innovation,"A strong focus question directs attention to an area of the external business environment that leaders believe will have a significant impact on the organization's future; it defines what in that area is of most interest. It is strategically relevant, focused on business needs, and framed in a way that is likely to create meaningful and proprietary knowledge about the future. The best way to find the right focus question is to base it on an important part of the company's business model. One way to identify a relevant focus question is to look at potential pain points. Generally, the survey of leadership used to map the business model will also reveal a common set of external pressures that could affect the company's business model. Centering the focus question on that element can yield actionable insight. Slowing down at the beginning to build a strong focus question that is strategically relevant enhances the success of the project, ensuring that it will produce usable information.",Crews C.,Journal,Research Technology Management,2016-05-01,AndSpace Consulting,
Matching service offerings and product operations: A key to servitization success,"OVERVIEW: Many manufacturers are moving to servitization, but making that move successfully requires considering the underlying business logic of a division or product. Differences in existing conditions, such as product characteristics or other business attributes, may determine success in transition to a services-based business model and create challenges for a firm moving, for instance, from a spare-parts model to advanced service contracts. Our study pinpoints a number of key product attributes that define how far a company can move up the service ladder. The findings suggest that the Power-by-the-Hour model pioneered by Rolls-Royce suits products that constitute critical ancillary input to, and not essential elements of, customers' core processes; that require low initial investments relative to high total costs of ownership; that are used in controllable operating environments with measurable performance requirements; and that are associated with high risk and high costs in the event of failure. Further, the service delivery system must be integrated and orchestrated to be product-specific - that is, aligned with the function and operating conditions of the product in use.",Jovanovic M.; Engwall M.; Jerbrant A.,Journal,Research Technology Management,2016-05-01,The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH),Case study ;  Service transition strategy ;  Servitization

This article introduces a comprehensive framework that addresses these two issues, by providing an integrated, value-based view of all of the critical components of the business model. The framework is applied to two well-known cases - Netflix and Spotify - to demonstrate how the tool can be used to highlight the critical differences in business models that may at first seem very similar and show how the framework enables managers to envisage the dynamics of business model innovation.",Rayna T.; Striukova L.,Journal,Research Technology Management,2016-05-01,UCL School of Management;Novancia Business School,Business model innovation ;  Netflix ;  Spotify ;  Value capture ;  Value-based perspective
Marginal Rate of Transformation and Rate of Substitution measured by DEA environmental assessment: Comparison among European and North American nations,"This study discusses the new use of DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) environmental assessment to measure MRT (Marginal Rate of Transformation) and RS (Rate of Substitution) among production factors (e.g., inputs, desirable and undesirable outputs). To measure the degree on MRT and RS, this study first examines a concept of disposability from the perspective of economic strategies to combat various environmental issues. The strategies are extendable to a policy change for pollution prevention. The underlying concept is separated into natural and managerial disposability. Under managerial disposability, it is possible for us to measure an occurrence of desirable congestion, or eco-technology innovation. Considering the disposability concept, this study discusses how to measure the type and magnitude of MRT and RS. A problem of the MRT & RS measurement is that these measures usually become unstable (e.g., very large or small in these magnitudes) because DEA does not assume any functional form for economic activities. To overcome such a difficulty, this study equips DEA environmental assessment with multiplier restriction by utilizing a unique feature on a proposed data treatment. The multiplier restriction in DEA has been never explored in previous works on environmental assessment. In an application, this study finds three important economic concerns on Europe and North America. First, Western Europe outperforms Eastern Europe and North America in their unified efficiency measures under managerial disposability. This study statistically confirms a difference between Western and Eastern Europe, but not between Western Europe and North America. This result exhibits that Eastern Europe is not yet well developed at the level of the other two regions. Second, Eastern Europe has exhibited MRT estimates that are different from Western Europe and North America. The nations in Eastern Europe have an economic potential for industrial developments because the level of their industrial pollutions is less than that of the other two regions. The potential is also found in their MRT estimates. Finally, an interesting difference can be found in the RS estimate between Eastern Europe and Western Europe from 2008 to 2012. They have statistically exhibited a difference between the two regimes, but not with North America. This is because most nations in both Western Europe and North America have already attained a high level of economic successes so that they have a limited industrial potential under current production technology and eco-technology. The situation of the two regions will be changed along with new technology development. In contrast, Eastern Europe is different from the other two regions in terms of attaining such a level of social sustainability because of limited capital accumulation and limited opportunity for technology innovation.",Sueyoshi T.; Yuan Y.,Journal,Energy Economics,2016-05-01,New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology,DEA environmental assessment ;  Marginal rate of transformation ;  Rate of substitution
Human Bond Communications: Generic Classification and Technology Enablers,"The ICT technology expansion and rapid penetration supported by extensive research and innovations has started to change the users’ requirements for novel services and applications. Up to now, the evolution of wireless communication systems only focused on improving the way the information is exchanged between two or a group of communication entities. However, emerging user expectations for novel personalized scenarios have driven the requirement for revolutionary and divergent approaches that will foster the virtualization of human emotions, senses, and thoughts. Human Bond Communication reflects this communications paradigm shift. It represents a holistic approach capable of describing and transmitting the features of an object in the way a human perceives it. Human Bond Communication incorporates all human senses for modeling a physical object into an information-digital domain. It also focuses on actuating and transmitting the data of the physical object through an underlying communication platform. This paper elaborates on the Human Bond Communication related topics, providing a comprehensive classification and survey of the current research works, as well as identifying the key challenges for future research.",Gavrilovska L.; Rakovic V.,Journal,Wireless Personal Communications,2016-05-01,Ss.

How energy technology innovation affects transition of coal resource-based economy in China,"The aim of this research paper is to investigate factors and mechanisms that may facilitate the transition from coal resource-based economy to sustainability. Based on the energy technology innovation theory, factors that may influence the transition of coal resource-based economy were categorized into four types, including: innovation policy, innovation input, innovation ability, and innovation organization. Hypotheses were proposed regarding the mechanisms of these factors. Data were collected from surveys administered to 314 Chinese energy firms, and a structural equation model (SEM) was employed to test the hypotheses. Ten of fifteen hypotheses were retained based on the reliability tests, validity tests, and SEM. The results show that the four proposed factors are crucial in transforming the coal resource-based economy, and the effects become statistically significant through three intermediate variables, namely, transition of energy consumption structure, correction of resource wealth investment, and improvement of transition environment.",Guo P.; Wang T.; Li D.; Zhou X.,Journal,Energy Policy,2016-05-01,Xinzhou Teachers University;Shanxi University of Finance and EcoNomics;North University of China,Coal ;  Energy technology innovation ;  Resource-based economy ;  Sustainability ;  Transition
Complex evaluation of sustainability in engineering education: Case & analysis,"The main issue for engineering education is ""contextual awareness"", i.e. the ability to view actions, problems, solutions and consequences in a broader context comprising scientific, technical, economic, legal, social or cultural aspects. Engineering education already deals, in varying degrees, with the environment, professional ethics and behaviours, matters of health and safety, as well as discipline - specific problems related to engineering processes and practices. The new objectives lie in the domain known as social responsibility and sustainable development. The QUESTE-SI (Quality system of European Scientific and Technical Education for Sustainable Industry) program initially focused on quality management in engineering education, but during the last two years it shifted to a different issue - the place of social responsibility and sustainability in engineering education. The Institute of Environmental Engineering at Kaunas University of Technology has been selected as a pilot institution for QUESTE - SI evaluation and accreditation process with the M.Sc. program ""Environmental Management and Cleaner production"" and PhD program ""Environmental Engineering and Landscape Management"". The Self-Assessment reporting and external auditing/evaluation have been performed in four dimensions: (i) Organization of social responsibility and sustainability education at the university and institute level; (ii) Education and curriculum of the programs; (iii) Student involvement and cultural development; and (iv) Research & innovation at the institute level. A key point when defining and evaluating learning objectives is whether they include the ability to anticipate the consequences of decisions and to act appropriately (a proactive rather than reactive approach). The paper presents analyses of the selected programs, the methodology, self-evaluation and external auditing process, evaluation criteria and results of the QUESTE - SI evaluation. The complex evaluation and the case clearly show how the high education institution could become a model of sustainable operations, research and development, and sustainability culture. It means a well-defined short, medium and long-term institutional and department strategy for sustainability is needed. The strategy should focus on objectives, planning, implementation, and on results that serve as performance indicators.",Staniškis J.; Katiliute E.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2016-05-01,Kaunas University of Technology,Engineering education ;  Evaluation ;  Industry ;  Social responsibility ;  Sustainability ;  University
Multi Business Model Innovation in a World of 5G: What Will Persuasive Business Models Look Like in a World of 5G?,"The development and innovation of business models to a world of 5G—is a complex venture related to the human and human bond issue and has not yet been widely researched. Numerous types of sensor and wireless technologies are these days “spread” all over both external and internal the human being and human bond. More advanced persuasive technologies is expected to be present in the next years. Business Models that are embedded with persuasive technologies leaves us with two question—How can we expect persuasive business models to operate in the future? and What will the impact on human bonds in a world of 5G be? The development of persuasive secure technologies gives hopes to realize persuasive business models that could act and could be “human”. However persuasive technologies and persuasive business models are created to “persuade” and change behavior. There is therefore a strong need to get better understanding of how persuasive businesses models really works and understand what they can really do to human bonds. The paper gives a conceptual futuristic look to persuasive business models embedded with persuasive technologies and relates this to the human bond discussion on behalf of the input from SW2015, lab experiments in the MBIT and Stanford Peace Innovation Lab together with some preliminary case research. State of the art on persuasive business model and persuasive technology research are presented and finally a summary is given on what we can expect in a future world of 5G.",Lindgren P.,Journal,Wireless Personal Communications,2016-05-01,Aarhus Universitet,Business model ;  Business model innovation ;  Persuasive business models ;  Persuasive technology
Impacts of personality traits on consumer innovation success,"Via a study of innovating and non-innovating German consumers, we explore links between the ""Big Five"" personality traits and successful accomplishment of three basic innovation process stages by consumer-innovators: (1) generating an idea for a new product or product improvement, (2) developing a prototype that implements that idea, and (3) diffusing the innovation to others. We find that personality traits are significantly associated with success differ at each stage. First, those who score higher on openness to experience are significantly more likely to have new product ideas. Second, being introverted and conscientious is significantly associated with successful prototyping. Third, those who possess high levels of conscientiousness are more likely to successfully commercially diffuse their innovations, whereas, in contrast, conscientiousness lowers the likelihood of successful peer-to-peer diffusion. Since the personality traits associated with successful completion of each stage differ, and the same individual with the same traits must traverse each stage in sequence, we find that personality traits strongly affect the likelihood of overall success. That is, an individual innovator with a personality profile highly favorable to successful completion of all stages is several times more likely to successfully complete all three stages than is an individual with a highly unfavorable profile. We suggest solutions to this practical problem, and also offer suggestions for further research.",Stock R.; Von Hippel E.; Gillert N.,Journal,Research Policy,2016-05-01,MIT Sloan School of Management;Technische Universität Darmstadt,Consumer innovation ;  Diffusion ;  Personality ;  Product solution ;  User innovation
Divergent effects of external financing on technology innovation activity: Korean evidence,This paper explores a variety of effects of external financing subdivided into bank loans and bond and stock issues on the technology innovation activity (TIA) of Korean listed firms for the full sample period of 1st January 2000 to 31st December 2008. We find evidence that indirect external financing of bank loans makes a negative impact on TIA of the Korean firms whereas direct external financing of security issues does a positive one on it. The results support the hypothesis of manager discretion that banks' conservative lending criteria demanding considerable collaterals from firms discourage managers from an investment in TIA with high risk-high return while external financing via security issues grants managers more discretion for their TIA. This study building up the prior literature that primarily devote to an effect of internal financing on TIA of firms provides firm managers or academic researchers with valuable implications for evaluation of various impacts and roles of external financing in association with financing decisions for TIA of firms.,Kim S.; Lee H.; Kim J.,Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2016-05-01,Graduate School of Business Administration;Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd.;Chosun University,Bank loans ;  External financing ;  Manager discretion ;  Security issues ;  Technology innovation activity
First-mover advantages of the European Union's climate change mitigation strategy,"This paper assesses the costs and benefits for the European Union (EU) as a first mover in climate change mitigation. Scenarios of EU and global climate action to 2050 are quantified using the GEME3-RD model, a global multi-sectoral computable general equilibrium model with endogenous technology progress and detailed representation of the clean energy technologies. The model includes two-factor learning curves (stock and research and development funding) for clean energy technologies, such as electric vehicles, carbon capture and storage, and renewable and efficient appliances. Funding of research and development is endogenously derived as a production factor enabling productivity improvement. The scenarios compare stylised climate strategies, which are asymmetric by world region and have different emission reduction profiles over time. Assuming that strong climate mitigation action will be undertaken only after 2030, the scenarios compare two main strategies for the EU: pursuing strong emission reduction unilaterally until 2030 versus deferring action for the period after 2030. Asymmetric climate action by region enables asymmetric innovation and manufacturing of clean energy technologies. The macroeconomic assessment of the climate action strategies does not only depend on costs of clean technologies but also on induced technology progress implying asymmetric effects on manufacturing and trade by region, taking into account spillovers. The model-based projections show clear advantages for the EU as a first mover in climate change mitigation compared with a delaying of climate action until 2030. Delayed climate action until 2030 implies higher gross domestic product losses for the EU compared with unilateral action until 2030. The model finds benefits of early action by the EU driven by activity and progress related to clean energy technologies as the EU can achieve competitive advantages over other world regions pursuing climate action later.",Karkatsoulis P.; Capros P.; Fragkos P.; Paroussos L.; Tsani S.,Journal,International Journal of Energy Research,2016-05-01,National Technical University of Athens (NTUA),Climate change mitigation ;  Computable general equilibrium modelling ;  Economic growth induced by technology progress ;  Macroeconomic assessment of clean energy technologies
Employees' Innovative behavior in social context: A closer examination of the role of organizational care,"A substantial body of research has examined the antecedents of innovation in organizational settings, but our current understanding of how social aspects of the work environment influence the innovative behavior of employees remains underdeveloped. One of these social aspects connected to the theme of ""doing well by doing good"" concerns organizational care, with scholars examining how actions centered on promoting employee well-being may result in pro-organizational outcomes. The purpose of this study is to present a conceptual analysis of the intricate relationship between organizational care and employees' innovative behavior by detailing key mediating mechanisms and conditional factors. This research will combine insights from multiple theories and literatures, most notably self-determination theory, social exchange theory, and the literatures on organizational care, work motivation, and innovation. The proposed multilevel model clarifies how organizational care affects the creative, complex, and mundane elements of employees' innovative behavior through its effect on the motivational constructs of intrinsic motivation, identified motivation, and introjected obligation feelings, respectively. Moreover, the model highlights the potential dark sides of organizational care that managers must consider when designing and implementing caring policies and practices. Specifically, it clarifies how the effect of organizational care on employees' innovative behavior may depend on their subjective perceptions of care intrusiveness and care insincerity. As such, this study responds to calls for rich and nuanced conceptual research in the innovation field, especially concerning the role of employees' social work environment in motivating their innovative behavior. Important theoretical and practical implications of this conceptual analysis will be discussed, and valuable directions for future research will be outlined.",Bammens Y.,Journal,Journal of Product Innovation Management,2016-05-01,Maastricht University School of Business and Economics,
Micro- and Nanosystems for Biotechnology,"Emphasizing their emerging capabilities, this volume provides a strong foundation for an understanding of how micro- and nanotechnologies used in biomedical research have evolved from concepts to working platforms.

Collaborative innovation in Smart Networks - A methods perspective,"Innovation management methods have been subject to extensive research during the last decades, many of which have found their way to application in practice. However, innovation management methods are still predominantly used within company boundaries, although knowledge contributions of external business partners could often boost the benefits of applying these methods. Smart Networks, focusing on Organizational Networking, Knowledge Networking and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Networking, offer an approach for the collaborative, inter-enterprise implementation of such methods. This paper presents an engineering approach for how innovation management methods can be applied collaboratively within this specific form of enterprise networking. An approach to implement innovation management methods with help of ICT applications is highlighted. Exemplarily, an implementation of the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) method is illustrated.",Lau A.; Fischer T.; Rehm S.; Hirsch M.,Conference Proceeding,"2009 IEEE International Technology Management Conference, ICE 2009",2016-04-27,Centre for Management Research,Collaborative Innovation ;  Innovation Management ;  Methods for Innovation Management ;  Smart Networks
Constructing a constraint net during the modeling stage of aircraft product design,"During designing the aircraft product, it's important to have a good model for the designer. Traditional model of aircraft doesn't validate the information stored in the knowledge base. There are some works on constraints net now, but the algorithm and the procedure is very complicated. There is not a constraint description language and a general way to represent the constraints on model. In this paper, we build an aircraft product model based on knowledge base in the concurrent engineering way. We use the PAL (Protégé Axiom Language) and our extended Java code to describe the constraints and construct a constraint net. The knowledge base model with constraint net describe product itself with more accuracy than traditional model. The aim of this research is reducing the time and cost to improve efficiency of aircraft product innovation.",Luo X.; Huang N.,Conference Proceeding,"2005 IEEE International Technology Management Conference, ICE 2005",2016-04-27,Beihang University,Concurrent Engineering ;  Constraints Net ;  Knowledge Base ;  Product Innovation

Dynamic project-based STEM curriculum model for a small humanities high school,"Reforming STEM education has been an urgent national call for both educational and economic reasons. For Eleanor Roosevelt High School, a small humanities high school in New York City, implementing a large-scale, school-wide STEM education is almost an unattainable goal due to limited STEM resources. However, we have developed a novel, dynamic project-based STEM curriculum model in the past five years. This model will provide students with in-depth exposure to computer science and engineering, broad and rigid training of innovative engineering problem solving, and independent research experience with challenging real-world problems. The curriculum has been vertically integrated over grades to create a cohesive learning experience and to maximize learning outcomes. It can dynamically evolve over time to reflect cutting-edge advancements in the STEM field. One of the most challenging steps in developing the STEM curriculum model is the creation of the 'Research & Development' layer of the model. Fortunately, the NSF-founded Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation-Research Experience and Mentoring (EFRI-REM) summer program at The City College of New York provides inspirations and insights to these problems. Though this model has been developed in a small humanities high school, it can easily be scaled up or down for schools of various sizes and adopted by schools of different context and resource levels. We have further proposed a new STEM research paradigm for college-high school collaboration, dramatically accelerating the renew rate of high school STEM curriculum.",Lin C.; Zhu Z.; Ro T.,Conference Proceeding,ISEC 2016 - Proceedings of the 6th IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference,2016-04-20,The Graduate Center;City College of New York;Eleanor Roosevelt High School,Dynamic curriculum ;  High school ;  Project-based learning ;  STEM education ;  STEM research

Paediatric rehabilitation engineering: From disability to possibility,"Innovations in paediatric rehabilitation engineering can serve as a springboard to education, psychosocial, social, physical and cognitive development for children and youth with disabilities. Instead of providing an overview of rehabilitation engineering, Paediatric Rehabilitation Engineering focuses on the uniqueness of the paediatric subspecialty via an international sampling of methods and techniques currently in use or in development. The book is divided into three complementary components. The first group of chapters is broadly concerned with connecting individuals to their environment and to the people around them. The second group revolves around paediatric technologies that compensate for compromised or missing function. The final group of chapters is about machines and environments which provide stimulating and interactive platforms for therapy and research. Topics include: Microswitch-based occupational, recreational and rehabilitation programs Emerging access technologies, like infrared thermal imaging and vocal cord vibration detection Communication technologies to enable children to communicate in a variety of everyday environments Accessible graphical user and Web-based interface design Postural and upper and lower extremity compensation, such as customized chairs and prostheses Global efforts in the area of robotics for autism research Virtual reality and other interfaces to mitigate motor, communication, and physical control difficulties Paedriatric rehabilitation engineering offers endless possibilities for future research with implications across the fields of physical and cognitive rehabilitation, medicine, computer science, and policy. It is the harmonizing of the expertise and energies of rehabilitation professionals such as teachers, families, paediatric rehabilitation engineers, and other stakeholders that will ensure that children are optimally supported as they embark on their journey from disability to possibility.",Chau T.; Fairley J.,Book,Paediatric Rehabilitation Engineering: From Disability to Possibility,2016-04-19,"Bloorview Research Institute;University of Toronto, Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering",
The power of local action in occupational health: The adoption of local exhaust ventilation in the Chicago tuckpointing trade,"Background: Silica is a pervasive and potentially deadly occupational hazard in construction. The occupational risk posed by silica has long been known, but efforts to use engineering controls to minimize dust generation in tuckpointing operations, a masonry restoration specialty, have been slow. Objectives: The objective of this study is to explore how local innovation in occupational safety and health may emerge, absent the establishment of national standards. Method:This study uses a case study to explore the adoption of local exhaust ventilation in tuckpointing operations in the Chicago area. Sources of data for this research include interviews with a diverse range of key informants and the review of archival material. Results: This case study found local unions, municipal regulators, contractors, and major public users of construction services played a central role in the events and milestones that led to the early adoption of local exhaust ventilation in Chicago. The adoption of local exhaust ventilation technology in Chicago demonstrates the potential for local actors to fill an important void when rulemaking in vital areas of occupational of health impedes effective national regulation.",Weinstein M.; Susi P.; Goldberg M.,Journal,International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health,2016-04-19,The Center for Construction Research and Training;Florida International University;The City University of New York,Construction ;  Local exhaust ventilation ;  Occupational health ;  Silica ;  Tuckpointing
Innovation in Healthy and Functional Foods,"The focus of food science and technology has shifted from previous goals of improving food safety and enhancing food taste toward providing healthy and functional foods. Today's consumers desire foods that go beyond basic nutrition-foods capable of promoting better health, or even playing a disease-prevention role. To meet this need for innovation, academic research must be combined with the development and commercialization strategies of industry. Innovation in Healthy and Functional Foods brings together this knowledge, with contributions from experts in biological science, food science, engineering, marketing, regulation, law, finance, sustainability, and management. Focusing on functional foods that have components added-such as omega-3, probiotics, and protein-to provide health benefits, this book presents various aspects of the innovation process. These include consumer insights, trends in developed and developing markets, and technological advances in functional foods and ingredients. It also addresses the key drivers of food industry innovation-affordability, sustainability, and tightening government regulations. Chapters cover characteristics of various markets around the world; consumer perception; food processing, packaging, and ingredients; innovation in functional ingredients; and functional ingredient delivery. Given the importance and challenges of getting functional food products into the marketplace, this book also covers the business aspects of innovation in food science, including marketing, financial implications, and commercial feasibility. Additionally, contributors provide insights into future trends, such as food tourism, nanotechnology, sustainability, and globalization. Bringing together expertise from academia and industry, this text provides an overview of contemporary food science, with wisdom and know-how in both innovation and commercialization, placing functional foods in a broader context for readers.",Ghosh D.; Das S.; Bagchi D.; Smarta R.,Book,Innovation in Healthy and Functional Foods,2016-04-19,Massey University;University of Houston;Interlink Marketing Consultancy Pvt.

Design and application of dry anaerobic fermentation system using flexible membrane-covered garage,"Relative to wet fermentation, dry fermentation (the density of fermentable dry substrate materials ≥ 20%) is a new technology that anaerobia are used to decompose animal manure, straw and other organic solid wastes into CH4 and CO2. This technology is an effective way to deal with rural organic wastes. However, considering the status of current research and application of dry fermentation, the technology developed in other countries has complex facility structure, high investment, complicated operation and higher safe operation requirements of the system. Domestic dry fermentation, which mainly focuses on ways to improve the rate of gas production and the pretreatment of fermentation feedstock rather than optimizing the structural design, enhancing heat and mass transfer, improving warming and insulation effects, and reducing production costs, has been hardly seen in large-scale production and its research has been limited in the pilot or experimental study. For the flexible membrane covered garage dry anaerobic fermentation introduced in this paper, we have combined the typical mature German garage dry fermentation with domestic flexible membrane covering to achieve technological integration and innovation. Our research provided data reference and technical support for large scale application of anaerobic dry fermentation in China. To overcome high costs, inefficiency, intensive labor, and time and human resources required for treating large quantity of biogas slurry residue, the difficulty of raw material pretreatment, high water consumption, and poor adaptability of raw materials in present anaerobic fermentation, the system in this paper was suitable for the mixed anaerobic fermentation of organic materials of various sources. Based on processing requirements of dry anaerobic fermentation, the new system had defined the key structural and operational parameters and designed facilities including dry fermentation reservoir, temperature enhancement system in winter and the spray enhanced heat and mass transfer system which was also under experiment. According to the production and application, the structure design of dry fermentation reservoir was reasonable. The design of temperature increased in the system that met the requirement in dry fermentation engineering and the spray system achieved the purpose of heat and mass transfer. The tests showed that the system was in good condition with gas production of 0.81 m3/(m3∙d), 67% CH4, and 48% degradation of raw materials. The stability of the system had greatly improved the ability of processing rural organic wastes and promoted the sustainable, healthy and rapid development of anaerobic fermentation.",Zhu D.; Xie H.; Cao J.; Han B.; Li R.; Wang P.; Qu H.; Zhao W.; Wang D.; Ma B.,Journal,Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering,2016-04-15,Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China,Biogas ;  Design ;  Fermentation ;  Flexible membrane ;  Garage model
Innovations in hierarchical zeolite synthesis,"There has been growing interest in the research and development of hierarchical zeolites possessing at least two levels of porosity in order to reduce diffusion limitations in reactions catalyzed by microporous zeolites. Engineering and manipulation of the hierarchy of pore structures are required to facilitate transport of large reactants and to improve the accessibility of active sites in zeolite catalysts. Various strategies and approaches have been proposed and developed in order to introduce secondary porosity, which is usually in the mesopore range, for conventional zeolites. From controllable post-synthetic modifications to designed direct synthesis with or without mesopore templating agents, significant progress has been made over the past several years in making hierarchical zeolites. In this paper, recent innovations in the synthesis of hierarchical zeolites by different methods will be reviewed, including post-synthetic demetallation, hard- and soft-templating approaches, and template-free routes. We will also discuss separately the progress of hierarchical structures derived from two-dimensional (2D) zeolite nanosheets. A summary and outlook will also be discussed with the focus on providing industrial perspectives of this field.",Zhang K.; Ostraat M.,Journal,Catalysis Today,2016-04-15,Aramco Services Company: Aramco Research Center - Boston,2D zeolites ;  Desilication ;  Hierarchical zeolites ;  Mesoporous zeolites ;  Templating
Democracy and innovation: from institutions to agency and leadership,"Democracies are, by definition, marked by a strong normative commitment to innovation and change, and all democratic regimes must seek to generate innovations both to keep their fundamental promise and to secure their own survival. In response to the latent crisis of representative democracy, recent political research has devoted eager attention to innovating democratic institutions, yet with conspicuously little regard for the likely effects of such reform proposals on the innovation-related performance and innovation capacity of democratic regimes. Indeed, some reform proposals, if implemented, would appear to reduce rather than increase the innovation capacity of representative democracies. Innovation-focused leadership may be able to fill that gap and provide what even the best institutions alone are unable to accomplish. In contrast to recent research on leadership and innovation in the public sector, which tends to centre on forms of collaborative leadership within networks, this article emphasizes the importance of individual leaders, and more specifically of political chief executives whose status and position in the governance process have been significantly enhanced by a combination of different factors. However, while leadership might be the key to democratic political innovation, innovative leadership and institutional engineering remain closely related to one another.",Helms L.,Journal,Democratization,2016-04-15,Universität Innsbruck,democracy ;  innovation ;  institutions ;  leaders ;  leadership
Introduction of adapting design thinking into the education in Kanazawa Technical College,"Design thinking is a popular method to make an innovation. It is a methodology of thinking as a human-centered experience. Japanese enterprises have a tendency to set a high value on students' innovative skills. This paper is an introduction to example of design thinking of Kanazawa Technical College (KTC) engineering education. KTC has several programs in its curriculum and extra-curriculum. Design method and Engineering Management are the subjects for learning the design thinking methodology. Graduation research, Learning Express, and Mini-Hydro Power Generation Contest are the programs for practicing the learned skills actually. Those programs received good response from the participated students and good result. In order to promote the design thinking, we disseminate it to all faculties, and made clear criteria for evaluating students' activities in the future.",Ito M.; Naoe N.; Imazawa A.; Matsushita O.,Conference Proceeding,"2015 IEEE 7th International Conference on Engineering Education, ICEED 2015",2016-04-12,Kanazawa Technical College,Design Thinking ;  Engineering Education
Adaptive robotic systems design in university of applied sciences,"In the industry for highly specialized machine building (small series with high variety and high complexity) and in healthcare a demand for adaptive robotics is rapidly coming up. Technically skilled people are not always available in sufficient numbers. A lot of know how with respect to the required technologies is available but successful adaptive robotic system designs are still rare. In our research at the university of applied sciences we incorporate new available technologies in our education courses by way of research projects; in these projects students will investigate the application possibilities of new technologies together with companies and teachers. Thus we are able to transfer knowledge to the students including an innovation oriented attitude and skills. Last years we developed several industrial binpicking applications for logistics and machining-factories with different types of 3D vision. Also force feedback gripping has been developed including slip sensing. Especially for healthcare robotics we developed a so-called twisted wire actuator, which is very compact in combination with an underactuated gripper, manufactured in one piece in polyurethane. We work both on modeling and testing the functions of these designs but we work also on complete demonstrator systems. Since the amount of disciplines involved in complex product and machine design increases rapidly we pay a lot of attention with respect to systems engineering methods. Apart from the classical engineering disciplines like mechanical, electrical, software and mechatronics engineering, especially for adaptive robotics more and more disciplines like industrial product design, communication &multimedia design and of course physics and even art are to be involved depending on the specific application to be designed. Design tools like Vmodel, agile/scrum and design-approaches to obtain the best set of requirements are being implemented in the engineering studies from the early beginning.",Gunsing J.; Gijselhart F.; Hagemans N.; Jonkers H.; Kivits E.; Klijn P.; Kapteijns B.; Kroeske D.; Langen H.; Oerlemans B.; Van Stuijvenberg J.,Conference Proceeding,MATEC Web of Conferences,2016-04-11,Avans University of Applied Sciences,
Waste in NPD processes of German SMEs,"Purpose – This study deals with waste in New Product Development (NPD) processes of SMEs. The purpose of this paper is to reveal opportunities for SMEs to overcome resource constraints in their NPD process. Design/methodology/approach – The authors employed qualitative key informant interviews. This design was chosen because research in this field is still limited. The authors performed 49 interviews in engineering-oriented German SMEs to examine the dimension of waste in NPD processes. The data were collected by conducting semi-structured, face-to-face interviews. Findings – The study highlights substantial waste types such as waiting times, rework and duplication of work. In contrast to contemporary literature, waste of material is considered to be relevant in particular for NPD processes of SMEs. In addition to that, the authors found that waste drivers differ to a great extent between the study and the hitherto literature on larger companies. Research limitations/implications – The overall outcome of this study can help organisations to address waste in NPD more thoroughly. The research presented was not specifically designed to draw statistical generalisations. For this reason, the results may not be applicable to all SMEs.

Innovations in evaluation: An integral part of outcome based education,"Education in India in 21st century demands innovations in the evaluation methods with the emergence of Outcome Based Education (OBE). Lots of Research is already done in innovations in teaching and learning methods, but very few literatures on the innovations in evaluations are available. The paper discusses various innovative methods for the evaluation of students. The pros and cones of traditional exam and the new methods are also discussed. A survey on the various method is carried out and the results of the same are also presented.",Mecwan A.; Shah D.; Fataniya B.,Conference Proceeding,NUiCONE 2015 - 5th Nirma University International Conference on Engineering,2016-04-07,"Nirma University, Institute of Technology",Open book exams ;  Outcome based education
System and software cost correlation to reliability,"While technology evolves, challenges in system requirements, design and reliability modeling continue to keep pace with future underlying technology innovations and domain changes. Complex-software intense web-based information systems, with personal banking, retail marketing and retail sales evolved to online transactions and so did the need for secure information assurance to protect from illegal hacking. New electronics, computer technologies and software and system methodologies evolve to keep pace with military, aerospace, medical, human, manufacturing and cyber security requirements, system reliability evolve. In addition, shortened product development life-cycle in industry and the Department of Defense (DoD) went from three years to 18-months incorporating system reliability analysis and modeling for hardware, electronics, and software into the requirements, design, development, test and evaluation, and operations and support (O&S) sustainment phases. The challenge of technology evolution has increased the demand for systems to be built to meet reliability requirements and designed to meet the human need at least possible cost. Cost Estimation Model II (COCOMOII) estimates software engineering effort and cost of a software system based on source lines of code, engineering team capabilities, reliability and process maturity [1]. Cost Estimation System Engineering Model (COSYSMO) estimates system engineering effort and cost of a system based on system requirement counts, engineering team capabilities, reliability and process maturity.[1] Reliability and cost modeling for a continuous complex system using common reliability models, COCOMOII and COSYSMO, demonstrated a correlation between reliability with cost and process maturity with cost during developmental phases of the product lifecycle. The empirical reliability and developmental cost data analysis using COCOMOII and COSYSMO is recognized with limitations since the cost correlation, process maturity, reliability impact was built on only one system during developmental phases. Despite limited samples, these preliminary results indicate that it is possible to estimate developmental cost increase as a function of reliability improvements and developmental cost decrease as a function of process maturity. Additional research and analysis should be done to replicate the analysis. Since these COCOMOII and COSYSMO do not estimate effort and cost during the O&S phase, an O&S cost model was provided to demonstrate the correlation of system and software cost to reliability for an evaluation of total ownership costs (TOC) and return on investment. To model total TOC which includes O&S costs, the Army Logistics Support Activity Cost Analysis Strategy Assessment (CASA) model was run on Predator Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), Global Hawk UAV, MH-60S Fleet Combat Support Helicopter, CH-47F Improved Cargo Helicopter, and Force XXI Battle Command, and Brigade-And-Below (FBCB2) systems [2]. The CASA model estimates TOC for the entire life-cycle of a system, implemented by Navy, Army, Air Force, NASA, U.S. Coast Guard, and Marines. The CASA model with the five systems established a relationship between achieved reliability improvement and reduction in O&S cost. The empirical reliability, investment, and O&S data analysis is recognized with limitations since the reliability investment and reliability impact was built on only five systems. Additional research and analysis should be done to replicate the analysis. Despite limited samples, these preliminary results indicate that it is possible to estimate O&S cost reductions as a function of reliability investment and reliability improvements. This is significant since O&S costs account for over two-Thirds of the TOC [3]. Further research can be done to evaluate process maturity impact on the entire acquisition life-cycle TOC. It is also recognized that the applicability of the results may be limited to the specific systems under evaluation, although this data are typical of those for mission critical systems comprised of hardware and software. Further research is necessary to determine whether the results are applicable to systems in general or better specified to particular types of systems. Whether the results would be applicable to other DoD or commercial systems could only be determined by additional research.",Lubas D.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings - Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium,2016-04-05,Naval Undersea Warfare System,Cost Correlation to Reliability ;  O&S Costs ;  Software Reliability ;  System Reliability
Modern selection criteria for procurement methods in construction: A state-of-the-art literature review and a survey,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive literature review that seeks to address modern factors worldwide that are associated with the selection of current procurement methods. The aim is to develop an up-to-date multi-attribute procurement decision-making chart for selecting the appropriate method for the project. Design/methodology/approach – Stage 1 (literature review). The search engines, Emerald; Business Source Premier; Science Direct and Sage were selected to identify journals that have published the most procurement methods-related articles. The search covered the period 1980-2015. Stage 2 (Survey) – after analyzing and appraising the literature, an up-to-date utility decision-making chart for selecting the appropriate procurement method for the project was developed. The chart was based on findings from a survey that included 57 construction professionals and who have demonstrated sound experience about the various procurement options. Findings – There is no one best procurement method for all projects. The selection depends on the nature of the issues or problem at hand. Decision making is not a punctual act. It is often a complex process. Effective decision making also demands quality and timely information, and a careful consideration of alternatives. The multi-attribute decision-making chart presented in this paper has included modern criteria and the client would have end up with different recommendations and consequences should these criteria were not included in priority weightings. Practical implications – The literature review provides states-of-the art research in the field of procurement methods in construction and the multi-attribute chart is intended to offer decision makers an opportunity to broaden their horizon on the different alternatives procurement routs that could lead to different consequences. Originality/value – To the best of the authors’ knowledge, very few publications have discussed modern selection criteria for procurement methods in construction under one study. Therefore, this paper has established a platform for scholars and researchers to obtain more useful insights into procurement methods concerns. It has identified research trends in procurement methods which may allow industrial practitioners to appreciate the key concerns in their development of modern concepts and principles such as supply chain, lean construction, sustainability, innovation, value engineering, e-procurement and Building information modeling. The inclusion of these modern criteria will present and add value to procurement decision makers within the construction industry.",Naoum S.; Egbu C.,Journal,International Journal of Managing Projects in Business,2016-04-04,London South Bank University,Modern selection criteria ;  Procurement methods

Open questions about open innovations,"As an opponent who lacks extensive understanding, has not read much or done a lot of research on the subject, I have the audacity to criticise the concept of Open Innovation. I hope my engineering background, industry innovation experience and former academic footprint are enough to start this discussion.

"Technology, innovation key to oil and gas production cost reduction","IHS, the leading global source of critical information and insight, has claimed that as persistent low oil prices take their toll on both industry profits and spending projections, oil and gas operators are turning, in part, to technology and innovation to reduce costs and increase capital efficiency in the short-term, while aiming to meet increased future energy demand in a low carbon environment. To o meet demand and remain competitive, operators are pursuing a range of cost-cutting and efficiency initiatives including automation and mechanization of high-cost, repetitive oil and gas activities, such as drilling. They're also looking to apply data-driven analytics to draw key insights from high-volume data streams, such as detecting when a piece of equipment is going to fail or identifying ‘sweet spots' in unconventional oil and gas plays. In still other instances, operators are increasing their use of mobility technologies to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their field workforces. IHS has identified several pockets of technological excellence that it believes offer the greatest potential to impact near-term oil and gas industry costs. One such pocket has been the exploitation of shale gas and tight oil resources. Another pocket of technological excellence IHS identified involves realizing substantial CAPEX and OPEX reductions through extreme de-manning, or operating oil and gas facilities with far fewer staff than is standard today. By leveraging both higher levels of automation and robust communication networks to remotely operate their facilities instead, oil companies can reduce OPEX by up to 70 percent, and can reduce CAPEX by 3 percent to 15 percent by designing facilities upfront to reflect these lower staffing levels.",Sawyer J.,Trade Journal,Manufacturing Engineering,2016-04-01,IHS Inc.,
Service delivery through mobile-government (mGov): Driving factors and cultural impacts,"The mobile-Government (mGov) service system is conducted through an open network, and it is virtual. This service mode and pattern change inevitably necessitates a behavioral change in citizen attitudes and intentions. Nevertheless, this new pattern of service delivery through mGov has hardly been systematically investigated by any researchers. The objective of this current research is twofold. First, we attempt to reveal the sources of beliefs for developing intention toward the mGov (ITM) system. Then, as the second objective, we investigate cultural influence as the reason for a difference in consumer attitudes and intentions toward mGov. In this regard, the empirical study was conducted in Bangladesh and the USA, which have potential differences in the cultural traits listed by Hofstede. From our statistical analysis, we have identified the sources of beliefs for both Bangladeshi and USA consumers.We observed clear differences in sources of beliefs and their influence on attitudes leading to intention, which demonstrates support for our second objective which was designed to verify the cultural impacts on belief-attitude relations.We understand that these different sources of beliefs influence cognitive, affective, and connative attitudes toward mGov in different ways.",Shareef M.; Kumar V.; Dwivedi Y.; Kumar U.,Journal,Information Systems Frontiers,2016-04-01,Sprott School of Business;School of Management;North South University,Attitude ;  Belief ;  Consumer behaviors ;  Cross-culture ;  Hofstede’s cultural traits ;  Intention ;  Mobile innovation ;  Mobile-government (mGov)
Theories and engineering practices of high-speed railway turnout system: Survey and review,"In order to promote the development of the high-speed railway turnout industry, the academic research situation, problems, concrete countermeasures and development trend in the field of the international high-speed railway turnout were reviewed systematically, including the components selection and structures design idea, the high-speed train/turnout coupling dynamic analysis, the design method of jointless turnout on different track foundation, the reasonable stiffness and homogenization design, the switching analysis of long moveable rails, the dynamic and static strength analysis of key joint components, the dynamic performance test technology, the turnout plane alignment and structure design in diverging lines, turnout manufacturing and laying, turnout maintenance and management, etc. However, in order to adapt to the development of the future rail transit technology, the high-speed railway turnout industry is still facing severe technical challenges. For example, the next generation of the high-speed railway turnout has problems such as the adaptability in the complex environment, the whole life cycle of design, the wheel/rail matching and the optimization of the train-turnout dynamic performance, the R&D and application of new materials and structures, the real-time acquisition and assessment of turnout condition parameters, the health management and fault prediction, the maintenance of capacity and effectiveness. In order to solve these problems, some cutting-edge technologies in advanced materials and manufacturing, intelligent and automation, big data and cloud computing, precision measurement and control, efficiency improvement, etc., need to be deeply integrated into the high-speed turnout system to enhance the original innovation ability of China in this field. Through the current situation and problem analysis, this review is expected to provide new perspectives and basic data for the academic research and technological innovation of the railway engineering disciplines.",Wang P.; Chen R.; Xu J.; Ma X.; Wang J.,Journal,Xinan Jiaotong Daxue Xuebao/Journal of Southwest Jiaotong University,2016-04-01,Southwest Jiaotong University,Design theory ;  High-speed railway turnout ;  Maintenance and management ;  Manufacturing and laying ;  Plane alignment ;  Structural components
Project excellece or failure? Doing is the best kind of learning,"Project management1 has been around for decades. and has also evolved over time. Likewise, the author has worked for a few decades in Industry with a prime focus on project management. Various flavors and even evangelists exist, from PMI2, IPMA3, Prince24, Agile5 and more. The author has had experiences with several of these flavors. Unfortunately for many years, a substantial amount of projects still does not deliver on time, on budget or worse do not create the value expected. It has been published in various media and type of organizations, from research to industry and government for example by organizations such as The Standish Group and others. It seems that despite of all the project evaluations, we have not learned from all those past projects. Nor did all the development in methods and tools help us overcome this problem, or it might be due to other factors such as the human factor, as has been subject of the Dutch National Research Group (DNRG6) on Project Management under the umbrella of IPMA. Why does this problem keep manifesting itself? And of course the question arises, how do we learn best? Time to rethink project management? The current article intends to provide Young Professionals some tips or at least food for thought, based on a personal retrospect based on just a few cases from the author's past experiences. In particular, it aims to give the members of the IEEE Young Professionals a perspective for a bright future, given the large number of technological, innovation, societal projects, and business ventures expected as we enter the era of digital transformation.",Bierwolf R.,Journal,IEEE Engineering Management Review,2016-04-01,TEMS,21st century skills ;  design thinking ;  human factors ;  innovation ;  learning ;  program management ;  Project management
Technology Business Incubation: An overview of the state of knowledge,"This paper introduces Technology Business Incubation (TBI) as a field of study and practice, exploring the concept, its evolution, and scholarship. Science parks, incubators and accelerators are TBI mechanisms considered to be important policy tools for supporting innovation and technology-oriented entrepreneurial growth. Their popularity is premised on the belief that these mechanisms provide critical value-added inputs essential for the creation and development of innovative Technology-Based Firms (TBFs). However, determining what type of TBI mechanisms and policies are most conducive to achieving the desired results is very much mission-driven and context-specific. A review of the past three decades of incubation literature, emerging practice, and future trends reveals that despite ongoing debate about their contribution and challenges, the future of TBIs is promising, and there are rich opportunities for research.",Mian S.; Lamine W.; Fayolle A.,Journal,Technovation,2016-04-01,TBS Business School;EMLYON Business School;State University of New York System,Accelerator ;  Incubation/incubator mechanism ;  Science/research park ;  Technology Business Incubation (TBI) ;  Technology-Based Firm (TBF)
Evaluating research: A multidisciplinary approach to assessing research practice and quality,"There are few widely acknowledged quality standards for research practice, and few definitions of what constitutes good research. The overall aim was therefore to describe what constitutes research, and then to use this description to develop a model of research practice and to define concepts related to its quality. The primary objective was to explore such a model and to create a multidisciplinary understanding of the generic dimensions of the quality of research practice. Eight concept modelling working seminars were conducted. A graphic representation of concepts and their relationships was developed to bridge the gap between different disciplines. A concept model of research as a phenomenon was created, which included a total of 18 defined concepts and their relationships. In a second phase four main areas were distilled, describing research practice in a multidisciplinary context: Credible, Contributory, Communicable, and Conforming. Each of these was further specified in a concept hierarchy together with a defined terminology. A comprehensive quality model including 32 concepts, based on the four main areas, was developed for describing quality issues of research practice, where the model of research as a phenomenon was used to define the quality concepts. The quality model may be used for further development of elements, weights and operationalizations related to the quality of research practice in different academic fields.",Mårtensson P.; Fors U.; Wallin S.; Zander U.; Nilsson G.,Journal,Research Policy,2016-04-01,Stockholms universitet;Handelshögskolan i Stockholm;Karolinska Institutet;Almain AB,Concept model ;  Multidisciplinary ;  Relevance ;  Research evaluation ;  Research practice ;  Research quality ;  Rigour
Nanopores to megafractures: Current challenges and methods for shale gas reservoir and hydraulic fracture characterization,"The past two decades have seen a tremendous focus by energy companies on the development of shale gas resources in North America, resulting in an over-supply of natural gas to the North American market in recent years. This shale gas ""revolution"" was made possible primarily through the application of drilling and completion technologies, particularly horizontal wells completed in multiple hydraulic fracturing stages (multi-fractured horizontal wells, or MFHWs). While these technologies have proven successful in commercializing the resource, imperfect understanding of basic shale gas reservoir properties, and methods used to characterize them, has perhaps led to inefficiencies in shale gas resource development and recovery that can be improved over time with further research.The purpose of the current work is to 1) provide an overview of shale gas storage and transport mechanisms 2) summarize the challenges associated with evaluating key reservoir and hydraulic fracture properties and 3) discuss recent advances by the authors in the area of shale gas reservoir and hydraulic fracture characterization. For the latter topic, advances in multi-scale characterization techniques, from reservoir sample evaluation to production data analysis will be addressed, however an emphasis will be placed specifically on methods to evaluate reservoir and rock properties along the length of the horizontal well to enable selection of hydraulic fracture stage placement and improved well forecasting. Rock cuttings retrieved during drilling are typically the only reservoir samples obtained from horizontal wells, and therefore methods for quantitative assessment of pore structure, gas content, gas-in-place, permeability, fluid-rock interaction, and rock mechanical property assessment will be discussed. In particular, the following recent innovations by the authors are highlighted: 1) use of the Simplified Local Density (SLD) model to account for fluid property alteration from pore confinement, and to predict high-pressure gas adsorption from low-pressure adsorption data collected for small amounts of cuttings samples 2) extraction of permeability/diffusivity from low-pressure adsorption rate data, also collected for small amounts of cuttings samples 3) use of a variable pressure, environmental SEM to assess fluid distribution and micro-wettability to support pore-scale modeling studies 4) estimation of unpropped hydraulic fracture permeability through generation of fractures in core plugs under stress 5) use of microhardness tests to evaluate fine scale changes in ""mechanical stratigraphy"" and 6) use of sonic core-holders to provide measurements of dynamic rock mechanical properties for shale samples subject to in-situ stress. Modification of diagnostic fracture injection tests (DFITs), a common well-testing technique performed on shales to derive reservoir property and stress information but performed usually only at the toe of horizontal wells, to enable tests to be performed at multiple points along a horizontal well, will be proposed. Finally, advances in production analysis methods to account for effects such as pore confinement, relative permeability, and stress-dependent permeability will be reviewed, as will techniques for extracting hydraulic fracture properties through analysis of flowback data.It is hoped that this summary will provide geoscientists and engineers with a comprehensive overview of shale gas reservoir and hydraulic fracture evaluation challenges and potential solutions, with a view to enabling more efficient shale gas extraction.",Clarkson C.; Haghshenas B.; Ghanizadeh A.; Qanbari F.; Williams-Kovacs J.; Riazi N.; Debuhr C.; Deglint H.,Journal,Journal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering,2016-04-01,University of Calgary,Fluid storage ;  Fluid transport ;  Hydraulic fracture characterization ;  Reservoir characterization ;  Shale gas

New plant design options expand geothermal power operations,"Idaho-based POWER Engineers, a consulting services and engineering firm, confirmed that technological innovations in geothermal plant exploration and operations are changing the industry. The combinations of double- and triple-pressure steam-condensing plants with bottoming cycle binary plants are revolutionizing the industry. Also, binary plant technology has seen improvements in its overall thermodynamic cycles, including the optimization of working fluid composition to better match the temperature conditions. Another innovative project was the US DOE's Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE). FORGE is an early stage program to select a US-based site to develop a center for improving both exploration and utilization of geothermal energy, including expanding the technology of enhanced geothermal systems, which is a promising new field in geothermal research where a high-temperature geologic area cannot support a commercial facility in its natural state due to a lack of fluid or permeability. Designing for optimal operation, flexible control of geothermal resources, and life-extension operation are also discussed.",Nelson A.,Trade Journal,Power,2016-04-01,,
A framework for teaching the fundamentals of additive manufacturing and enabling rapid innovation,"The importance of additive manufacturing (AM) to the future of product design and manufacturing infrastructure demands educational programs tailored to embrace its fundamental principles and its innovative potential. Moreover, the breadth and depth of AM spans several traditional disciplines, presenting a challenge to instructors, along with the opportunity to integrate knowledge via creative and demanding projects. This paper presents our approach to teaching AM at the graduate and advanced undergraduate level, in the form of a 14-week course developed and taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The lectures begin with in-depth technical analysis of the major AM processes and machine technologies, then focus on special topics including design methods, machine controls, applications of AM to major industry needs, and emerging processes and materials. In lab sessions, students operate and characterize desktop AM machines, and work in teams to design and fabricate a bridge having maximum strength per unit weight while conforming to geometric constraints. The class culminates in a semester-long team design-build project. In a single semester of the course, teams created prototype machines for 3D printing of molten glass, 3D printing of soft-serve ice cream, robotic deposition of biodegradable material, direct-write deposition of continuous carbon fiber composites, large-area parallel extrusion of polymers, and in situ optical scanning during 3D printing. Several of these projects led to patent applications, follow-on research, and peer-reviewed publications. We conclude that AM education, while arguably rooted in mechanical engineering, is truly multidisciplinary, and that education programs must embrace this context. We also comment on student feedback, our experience as instructional staff, and our adaptation of this course to a manufacturing-focused master's degree program and a one-week professional short program.",Go J.; Hart A.,Journal,Additive Manufacturing,2016-04-01,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Design ;  Education ;  Laboratory ;  Project ;  Teaching
"Renal Denervation: A Novel Therapy at the Crossroads of Imaging, Intervention, and Innovation","Hypertension (HTN) is one of the most significant medical problems affecting society today. The estimated 76 million Americans with hypertension represent a significant public health problem, contributing to cardiac, vascular, renal, and neurovascular morbidity and mortality. HTN is the most common indication for lifelong pharmacologic treatment, mainly because of the incontrovertible reductions in cardiovascular events with blood pressure (BP) reduction and control. However, despite the availability and potency of multiple different antihypertensive drugs, up to half of American patients have BPs above the recommended target. Given the overwhelming evidence of both the cost to society of HTN and the benefits that are accrued from improved BP control, alternatives or adjuncts to current management options have been sought to aid in treatment of these patients. Over the past few years, a device-based approach involving modulation of the autonomic nervous system, termed renal denervation, has evolved to meet this challenge. With early trials showing startlingly good results, with few side effects, multiple devices were fast-tracked to clinical trials and hence to the market. However, larger trials have shone an unfavorable light on the field, with concerns about the short- and long-term effectiveness, diverting attention back to operational and procedural details. Despite this, image-guided manipulation of the sympathetic nervous system to treat HTN remains a fertile area of laboratory and clinical research.",Moriarty J.; Tung R.; Bradfield J.; McWilliams J.; Lee E.; Kuo M.,Journal,Journal of Laboratory Automation,2016-04-01,David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA,clinical automation ;  engineering ;  hospital/clinical ;  laboratory management ;  systems
Progress in emerging solution-processed thin film solar cells - Part I: Polymer solar cells,"Polymer solar cell (PSC), also called organic photovoltaic solar cell (OPV), is an emerging solar cell, benefitting from recent advances in nano-structured and functional energy materials and thin films, making it a cutting edge applied science and engineering research field. The driving force behind the development of PSCs is the need for a low-cost, scalable, flexible, light-weight, and easy to manufacture power source, something that does not have the disadvantages of crystalline silicon and inorganic thin film solar cells. The fact that most layers of organic solar cells can be made from materials that can be processed in solution and deposited using low-cost casting methods in ambient conditions is a great advantage of solution-processed (SP) solar cells (SCs). The unique characteristic of this review, compared to other reviews, is its focus on solar cell materials and scalable fabrication techniques that are compatible with the concept of solution-process-ability. Following this perspective, in this paper, an overview of the principle of operation, recent progresses within the past few years, current challenges, and innovations pertinent to each layer of SP-PSCs and the entire device are provided. Detailed discussion on suitable materials for each layer, the effects of solvent treatment on nano-structure of each layer, cell stability and lifetime, and the state-of-the-art scalable methods suitable for large scale manufacturing of SP-PSCs are reviewed. At the end, future research trends in the area are deliberated. In Part II, recent advances in lead halide perovskite solar cells will be reviewed.",Wang Q.; Xie Y.; Soltani-Kordshuli F.; Eslamian M.,Journal,Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,2016-04-01,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Emerging solar cells ;  Organic photovoltaics ;  Organic solar cells ;  Polymer solar cell ;  Solution-processed solar cells
Situated regional university incubation: A multi-level stakeholder perspective,"From a macro perspective, it is widely acknowledged that University incubation models within a region are important stimulants of economic development through innovation and job creation. With the emergence of quadruple helix innovation ecosystems, universities have had re-evaluate their University incubation activity and models to engage more fully with industry and end users. However, within a given region, the type of University may influence their ability to engage with quadruple helix stakeholders and consequently impact their incubation activity. To date there is a scarcity of research which explores this 'meso' environment and its subsequent impact on University incubation models. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to use a stakeholder lens to explore University Incubation models within unique regional and organisational characteristics and constraints. The research methodology employed was based on a comparative case analysis of incubation of two different Universities within a UK peripheral region. It was found that variances existed in relation to the two universities incubation models which were found to result from both regional (macro environment) and organisational (meso environment) influences (i.e. university type). This research contributes to both regional and national agendas by empirically illustrating the need for appropriate design and tailoring of university incubation models (via acknowledgement of quadruple helix stakeholder influence) to incorporate contextual influences rather than adopting a best practise approach.",McAdam M.; Miller K.; McAdam R.,Journal,Technovation,2016-04-01,Ulster University Business School;Queen's University Belfast,Comparative case study analysis ;  Regional context ;  Stakeholder theory ;  University incubation models
Open innovation in software engineering: a systematic mapping study,"Open innovation (OI) means that innovation is fostered by using both external and internal influences in the innovation process. In software engineering (SE), OI has existed for decades, while we currently see a faster and broader move towards OI in SE. We therefore survey research on how OI takes place and contributes to innovation in SE. This study aims to synthesize the research knowledge on OI in the SE domain. We launched a systematic mapping study and conducted a thematic analysis of the results. Moreover, we analyzed the strength of the evidence in the light of a rigor and relevance assessment of the research. We identified 33 publications, divided into 9 themes related to OI. 17/33 studies fall in the high–rigor/high–relevance category, suggesting the results are highly industry relevant. The research indicates that start-ups have higher tendency to opt for OI compared to incumbents. The evidence also suggests that firms assimilating knowledge into their internal R&D activities, have higher likelihood of gaining financial advantages. We concluded that OI should be adopted as a complementary approach to facilitate internal innovation and not to substitute it. Further research is advised on situated OI strategies and the interplay between OI and agile practices.",Munir H.; Wnuk K.; Runeson P.,Journal,Empirical Software Engineering,2016-04-01,Lunds Universitet,Collective innovation ;  Collective invention ;  Literature review ;  Open innovation ;  Research agenda ;  Software engineering ;  User innovation

Emerging landscape of cell penetrating peptide in reprogramming and gene editing,"The plasma membrane remains a major barrier for intracellular drug delivery, to overcome this issue, a variety of approaches have been developed and used to deliver therapeutic cargos. Among these approaches, cell penetrating peptide (CPP) is promising and affords widely used vector for efficient intracellular delivery of cargos. Moreover, the latter findings including iPS reprogramming and direct transdifferentiation as well as gene editing have gradually become hot research topic; because their application in tissue engineering and disease modeling have great potential to advance innovation in precision medicine. Since the beginning, research on these approaches is mainly based on virus transduction system, while, under the consideration for obviating the risk of mutagenic insertion and enables more accurate controlling, CPP-based efficient virus-free delivery strategy has been used recently. In this review, we summarize the existing CPP-based delivery system, emerging landscape of CPP application in stem cell manipulation and reprogramming, along with CPP contributions to gene editing techniques.",Liu H.; Zeng F.; Zhang M.; Huang F.; Wang J.; Guo J.; Liu C.; Wang H.,Journal,Journal of Controlled Release,2016-03-28,Chongqing Three Gorges University;Hubei University for Nationalities;China Three Gorges University;Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine;Central Hospital of Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture,Cell penetrating peptide ;  Gene editing ;  Reprogramming ;  Stem cells

Impact of sustained low oil prices on China's oil & gas industry system and coping strategies,"The global continuous low oil prices have a significant impact on China's petroleum industry system and the national energy security. This paper aims to find solutions in order to guarantee the smooth development of China's petroleum industry system and its survival in such a severe environment. First, the origins of sustained low oil prices were analyzed. Then, based on those published data from IEA, government and some other authorities, this study focused on the development status, energy policies and the future developing trend of those main oil & gas producing countries. Investigations show that the low-price running is primarily contributed to the so-called oil and gas policies in a certain large country. It is predicted that national petroleum consumption will reach up to 6.0×108 t (oil) & 3300×108m3 (gas) in 2020 and 6.8×108 t (oil) & 5 200×108m3 (gas) in 2030. For reducing the degree of dependence on foreign oil and gas, the investment in the upstream of petroleum industry should be maintained and scientific research should be intensified to ensure the smooth operation of the oil and gas production system. Considering China's national energy security strategy, the following suggestions were proposed herein. First, ensure that in China the yearly oil output reaches 2×108 t, while natural gas yield will be expected to be up to 2700×108m3 in 2030, both of which should become the ""bottom line"" in the long term. Second, focus on the planning of upstream business with insistence on risk exploration investment, scientific and technological innovation and pilot area construction especially for low-permeability tight oil & gas, shale oil & gas reservoir development techniques. Third, encourage the in-depth reform and further growth especially in the three major state-owned oil & gas companies under adverse situations, and create more companies competent to offer overseas technical services by taking the opportunity of the ""One Belt and One Road"" policy. Finally, promote the new energy business and find solutions to turning those oil companies to integrated energy companies.",Chen J.; Wang N.; Tang H.; Li J.; Xiong B.,Journal,Natural Gas Industry,2016-03-25,Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration and Development;National Energy Shale Gas R & D <Experimental> Center;PetroChina Key Laboratory of Unconventional Oil & Gas Resources,China ;  Energy policy ;  Low oil price ;  National energy safety strategy ;  New energy ;  Oil & gas industry system ;  Oil & gas output ;  Origin analysis ;  Technical Service

Creative Design Engineering: Introduction to an Interdisciplinary Approach,"Creative Design Engineering: Introduction to an Interdisciplinary Approach presents the latest information on a field that has traditionally been primarily concerned with how to make things. However, as technology has advanced, and we have no shortage of things, a new challenge for today's engineers is what to make. In tackling this, our approaches to engineering design have come under the spotlight. This book presents solutions to this topic in different sections that highlight the basic concerns associated with innovation. First, design is considered a kind of universal human act. Second, it is an interdisciplinary approach that brings together perspectives from fields such as cognitive science and science of knowledge is adopted. Third, the scope of the discussion also includes the process of creating an initial idea for a new product (called the pre-design phase), as well as the use of the product in society (the post-design phase). Design engineers and researchers in engineering design will find this a user-friendly route to understanding the importance of creativity to engineering and how to implement new techniques to improve design outcomes. The book has been translated from the original Japanese book titled Sozo Dezain Kogaku [Creative Design Engineering] (published by the University of Tokyo Press 2014). Draws on research in industrial design, art, and cognitive science to present a concept of creativity which breaks free of traditional engineering thinking Deconstructs design as a human activity to increase our understanding, helping us create outstanding engineering projects and systems Includes discussion points to help the reader not only explore the concepts in the book, but also apply them to their own design contexts",Taura T.,Book,Creative Design Engineering: Introduction to an Interdisciplinary Approach,2016-03-22,Kobe University,

The banana Xanthomonas wilt epidemic in east and central Africa: Current research and development efforts,"Xanthomonas wilt is currently the major biotic threat to banana production in East and Central Africa (ECA). The recommended management options for the disease include destruction of infected plants, disinfecting tools used in the plantation, using clean planting materials, early removal of male buds and quarantine measures. These efforts to control the disease have produced partial success and the disease has continued to encroach into previously disease-free areas and to resurge in areas where it had been controlled. One of the major challenges to sustainable management of the disease has been poor understanding by stakeholders of the factors influencing disease spread. Current research efforts aim to provide additional information on disease epidemiology, fine tune existing cultural control practices, identify resistant and wilt escaping genotypes and develop a field detection tool. Development activities that aim at effective mobilization of stakeholders along the value chain for sustainable management of the disease (including use of farmer field schools (FFS) and learning and experimenting approaches for farmers (LEAFF)) have been evaluated and or implemented in ECA. In this paper, we discuss the different regional research and development efforts for the management of BXW. New research directions for sustainable management of BXW in ECA are suggested, including development of resistant banana cultivars through genetic engineering; exploring the potential use of endophytes as biological control agents; and studying modelling factors influencing BXW dynamics. Persistent challenges to managing BXW include: insufficient knowledge of the disease epidemiology critical for developing management strategies, inadequate mobilization and sensitization of the key stakeholder platforms along the production-consumption chain, ineffective surveillance methods leading to untimely actions, and lack of healthy BXW resistant seed. There is therefore need for continued research efforts and innovative approaches to effectively mobilize all stakeholders along the banana value chain.",Tinzaara W.; Karamura E.; Kubiriba J.; Ochola D.; Ocimati W.; Blomme G.; Ssekiwoko F.,Book Series,Acta Horticulturae,2016-03-22,Bioversity International;National Agricultural Research Organization,Biotic threat ;  BXW ;  Detection tool ;  Disease control ;  Escaping genotypes ;  Farmer field schools ;  Innovations

Niche strategy selection to introduce radically new systems: The case of kite-based airborne wind energy,"Commercializing radically new high-tech systems is a risky strategy, the failure rate is high. In practice, these systems are often introduced in market niches prior to large-scale diffusion in a mainstream market application. In previous research, we described barriers that block large-scale diffusion and we added to the contemporary literature by identifying ten specific niche strategies by analyzing historical case studies. Finally, we derived how specific niche-strategies can be selected after assessing the market in terms of these barriers. In this paper we present an expert interview method to identify barriers in a market and to select niche strategies. We will illustrate the method for the case of kite-based airborne wind energy systems. These systems are providing sustainable wind energy. Instead of using a wind turbine, these systems use a kite to generate energy. In total we interviewed six experts active in that field: managers and technology developers. A first result from the interviews indicates the most important barriers. We show how particular combinations of barriers, such as the lack of knowledge of the technology that has an effect on the support and investment opportunities, together block large-scale production and diffusion. A second result is that several niche strategies can be identified to tackle the barriers in this field. The «geographic niche strategy», the «demo, experiment and develop niche strategy» and the «educate niche strategy», for example are identified as good strategies to introduce the kite-based systems. The contribution of this paper is to present a practical structured expert interview method so these strategies can be selected using the experts' market experience and technology expertise. It is generally known that experts can experience difficulties to judge appropriate strategies to commercialize radically new high-tech systems. Our method shows how consistency checks between open and more structured parts of the interview can help detect evaluation problems and thereby safeguard the validity of the practical outcomes that experts can generate themselves.",Ortt J.; Kamp L.; Doe M.,Conference Proceeding,"2015 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation/ International Technology Management Conference, ICE/ITMC 2015",2016-03-21,Delft University of Technology,barriers ;  kite-based airborne wind energy ;  niche strategies ;  technological innovations
An application of a customer-centric innovation approach in the health industry: The case for video streaming in group fitness classes in German fitness centers,"In the dynamic environment of increasing customer expectations and fierce price competition it is hard for health service providers to keep constant service quality, not to mention improve it, considering the increasing cost of labour and services, while sustaining the customer relationship. On the other hand, with the emergence of mobile devices, cloud-based services and big data, new capabilities arise for transforming health services towards cost reduction, individualization, and even gaining a competitive advantage. This paradigm motivates a number of business-to-customer (B2C) service-level innovations in the health industry based on information and communication technologies (ICT). In this work, we present the results of a study we conducted among 522 gym members in Germany. The goal of the survey was to identify market opportunities for service-level improvements and validate them among gym members empirically. During the standard innovation process, we identified video streaming of trainings as a potential solution. We could furthermore prove a positive relationship between the participation of group fitness classes and customer satisfaction, as well as significant interest in technology-based innovation in the fitness industry.",Ruseva R.; Ruskov P.,Conference Proceeding,"2015 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation/ International Technology Management Conference, ICE/ITMC 2015",2016-03-21,Faculty of Mathematics and Informatic,connected health ;  customer-centric innovation ;  e-learning ;  innovation management ;  streamed video
"Designing an innovation engine model with stakeholder participation, exploratory stage","This paper presents results of the exploratory stage in the design of an open innovation engine model with innovation stakeholder participation. An innovation engine model is a representation of the components and interactions involved in the creation of novel solutions, systems or processes. They are mechanisms designed to help producing effective and efficient collaborations within organizations, or among large organizations (LO) and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs). Although there have been innovation engine models designed to support different organization in sectors such as healthcare, public services, aerospace, education and businesses, there is still missing a cost-effective model that helps creating new markets for SMEs by finding challenges requested by large organizations that need innovative solutions provided by SMEs' capabilities. Improved and actualized knowledge in this subject could contribute to inform the creation of more efficient and enhanced innovation mechanisms, which could be later engineered in innovation software tools. We organized a workshop with nine innovation stakeholders to brainstorm ideas towards the creation of an innovation model using participatory design. Results showed the components desired in an innovation engine model and the specification of a tool that can be later engineered in a software application. Interesting findings included the creation of a mechanism to correctly identify ideas, needs and requirements that may lead to produce innovative solutions, and the visualization of the idea in a polygonal-multi-point-of-view.",Hernandez-Munoz L.; Torane M.; Amini A.; Russell H.,Conference Proceeding,"2015 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation/ International Technology Management Conference, ICE/ITMC 2015",2016-03-21,Birmingham City University;Birmingham,Innovation ;  innovation engine ;  innovation engine models ;  open innovation
On the role of value-network strength as an indicator of technology-based venture's survival and growth: Increasing innovation system efficiency by leveraging transaction relations to prioritize venture support,"Technology-based ventures provide an important route for successful technology transfer [1], [2]. Their founders are supported in successful technology commercialization by innovation intermediaries [3]. Accordingly, the performance of an innovation system, at least to some extent, depends on the efficiency of these intermediaries in terms of the impact of their scarce resources on the survival and growth of technology-based ventures. To increase their efficiency, intermediaries typically optimize their «intake» by requesting a formal business plan to base their selection on as a hygiene factor [4]-[7]. Thus, some scholars argue that written business plans show significant distortion as being produced only to attract support from innovation intermediaries [6], [8]. Accordingly, they rarely serve for these addressees as a source of information for analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of ventures, in order to derive actionable conclusions and more effectively support ventures [9], [10]. Addressees search for different indicators in business plans for their evaluation [11]. The descriptions of these indicators only evince little empirical proof for the performance of technology-based venture's [8], [12]. This gap is herein addressed, in contrast to the lacking empirical insight, as the most frequently produced artifact of early-stage technology ventures is at the same time a written business plan [10], [13]. This paper addresses this gap by conceptualizing transaction relations described in the written business plan as a means for working around the inevitable inaccuracies and uncertainties that delimit the explanatory abilities [14] of the snapshot model [10] presented by a business plan. Using a qualitative content analysis, we derive from the descriptions of transaction relations in a written business plan valid indicators for the maturity of the venture's value-network in different dimensions [15]. To this extent, this paper presents the findings from a pre-study that was conducted based on a sample of forty business plans from an overall population of 800 business plans in a longitudinal sample from one of Europe's most active innovation systems, the regional State of Baden-Württemberg. Such findings may be used by innovation intermediaries to enhance their efficiency, by enabling these to not only derive individual support strategies for business acceleration but also to analyze the impact of support measures by reliably monitoring maturity progress in venture activities.",Konig M.; Baltes G.; Katzy B.,Conference Proceeding,"2015 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation/ International Technology Management Conference, ICE/ITMC 2015",2016-03-21,Hochschule Konstanz University of Applied Sciences;Universität der Bundeswehr München;Bwcon,business life-cycle ;  business plan ;  innovation intermediary ;  technology transfer ;  technology venturing ;  value-network (keywords)
Uncovering the needs and wants of end-users towards green apps: A Living Lab approach,"One of the biggest societal challenges is to reduce the impact on the environment [1]. During the last years a lot of digital tools and green apps have been developed in order to help individuals to lower their ecological footprint. These green applications can make use of the specific functionalities of smartphones such as mobility, smartness and connectedness in order to provide better and more personalized services [2-3]. However these applications mostly focus on one aspect of sustainability, such as transportation or electricity consumption. Moreover user research concerning the users' needs and wants towards these applications is lacking or is limited to only one research step such as testing a prototype version [3]. One approach in which end-users are involved intensively is the Living Lab approach. Therefore within this paper we will explore the role of Living Labs as an innovation intermediary in the research into green apps and more specific on the needs and wants of end-users concerning green apps. Therefore we conducted a single case study research of a Living Lab project in which the ecological footprint of end-users is being measured based on their transportation, housing as well as consumption. We argue that the Living Lab approach adds added value for conducting research on green apps because the user plays a central role within this research which makes it possible to adapt the service to the needs and wants of end-users through an iterative approach. Which is important seen the need of personalized green apps. Next to this the role of Living Labs as intermediary also assisted into the development of the green app.",Georges A.; Schuurman D.; Desmet M.,Conference Proceeding,"2015 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation/ International Technology Management Conference, ICE/ITMC 2015",2016-03-21,Faculteit Bouwkunde van de TU Delft;Universiteit Gent,Green Apps ;  Innovation Intermediary ;  Living Labs ;  Pro-environmental behavior ;  User Involvement ;  User Research
Leveraging collaborative innovation in SOA-based software providers networks,"The software sector plays a very relevant role in the current world economy as a means to face many societal challenges, especially considering that the sector mostly consists of SMEs. Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a recent ICT paradigm to help face new challenges in ICT developments and market. ICT companies should invest in innovative products and services to be sustainable, but SOA can be complex and a SOA «product» has many differences compared to manufacturing, which most innovation models are directed to. We present results of an innovation model directed at independent SMEs of SOA providers interested in innovating together, sharing costs, risks and benefits. The model is flexible so as to support the intrinsic uniqueness of innovation processes. The model is complemented with so-called functional guidelines, informing SMEs managers of the most important issues to handle during various steps of an innovation.

Model-based control for collaborative innovation projects: Concept and first case study,"Participating in and the coordination of innovation networks is very complex and difficult. In particular in loosely coupled networks of small and medium sized enterprises with the goal to develop knowledge intensive products and services. In the past these enterprises developed key competences due to the specialization on nice markets. Unfortunately these competences are no longer enough to develop products and services on their own. Most of these enterprises have only less experience in innovation and project management and no experience in network management. The basic concept for the participation is the Smart Networking concept known from former publications. Based on this idea the herein developed concept for a control structure for collaborative innovation projects should enable small and medium sized enterprises in participating in and even managing collaborative innovation projects. Therefore some methods and tools to analyze and document the relevant project data and network ecosystem are included in the control structure. The core of the control structure is a modeling environment to describe both an ideal and the planned process. For reasoning the optimal project management suggestions an ontology assesses the process model, the virtualized assets of the ecosystem and the actual and current project data. A first case study proves the value of the developed methods, tools and the overall control concept in a three years development project.",Matheis H.,Conference Proceeding,"2015 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation/ International Technology Management Conference, ICE/ITMC 2015",2016-03-21,Center for Management Research (DITF-MR),collaborative innovation ;  control theory ;  project management ;  SME networks

Option games analysis on biotech open innovation mediated by start-ups,"Biotech start-ups are superior at speed, cost, and risk-control to big pharmaceutical firms. But since the valley of negative profits is long and deep, their financial sustainability is under the influence of uncertainty and competitiveness. The following research questions have been posed: How can competitiveness make an impact on biotech start-up's flexibility for irreversible investment under uncertainty? What is a guideline for optimal timing on their exclusive period between business entry and strategic partnership for their survival? And, what is the optimal decision with imperfect information at in-license competition before business starts? As one of the keywords, biotech start-up is defined as a portfolio of real options. Secondary, biotech open innovation is an ecosystem of start-ups for biotech technology transfer. Methodology is option games analysis or strategic option by integrating between real options and game theory. The objective is to examine the potential of option games for biotech start-ups, which are critical meditators in biotech open innovation, to continue the promising but risky projects. In particular we consider the optimal period between business entry and strategic partnership under uncertainty and competition, the optimal timing for in-license at pre-competition, and the value estimation of in-license based on the information disclosed from rivals under imperfect information competition. Finally we confirm the catalytic function of biotech start-up as a risk taking networker between universities and pharmaceutical companies at a case of PeptiDream.",Fujiwara T.,Conference Proceeding,"2015 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation/ International Technology Management Conference, ICE/ITMC 2015",2016-03-21,Toyohashi University of Technology,biotech start-ups ;  ecosystem ;  games theory ;  open innovation ;  real options
An integrative approach improves sustainability impacts of innovation. An empirical study,"A review of recent literature in the field indicates there is an increasing interest in improving sustainability performances of manufacturing. The integrated innovation of product, process and supply chain can be a promising way to improve economic, social and environmental performances of manufacturing enterprises, but there is still a lack of empirical evidence on the topic. This paper compares the sustainability-related performances of three different states, which a unique business context went through.

Towards the actors' occupational movements of technical innovation system,"Linkage between science, engineering and technology creates and develops an academic program which includes a broad function from basic research to management of products and processes, called Technology and Innovation Management (TIM), with the aim of knowledge creation within innovation networks and subsequently, to advance humanities and develop economy. Nevertheless, given the relatively nascent nature of the TIM field, especially with respect to more established disciplines such as engineering, the occupations available to the individual actors of technical innovation networks remain unknown. As a preliminary step to addressing this gap, we identified individuals in innovation network employed in the Eindhoven province of the Netherlands, and studied what type of activities in their occupational movement they undertook. Further, we studied their linked-in profiles, which in many additional cases provides more useful information of the same type. The study results show an occupational movement typology that contains three types of paths available to the individuals - single, dual, and hybrid - pronounced by technical, managerial, entrepreneurial, consultancy, and academic occupations. The results reveal that more than half of the target sample follow a hybrid occupational movements, underlined primarily by technical activities across their work histories.

RandD models for advanced development & corporate research: Understanding six models of advanced RandD,"Our purpose is to develop new models that define the advanced development & corporate research approaches of modern global high tech firms. While the world has moved on from Bell Labs' famous advanced research model, visionary and farsighted technology-driven innovation is still vital to many of today's most successful global technology companies. Corporate innovation strategies are implemented through research laboratories, academic collaborations, advanced technology groups, standards groups, CTO office prototypes, internal/ external incubations, and open innovations. Unlike the well-understood nature of short-term product development, long time frames, fuzzily defined goals, and unclear measures of success lead to uncertainty of how to best run and fund advanced technology and applied corporate research. While all firms agree that advanced research is vital, their measures and processes differ widely. To identify modern models of effective advanced research approaches, the context in which such approaches are most effective, and the metrics by which they should be evaluated, we interviewed leaders at various successful and established global firms such as Cisco, Intel, Google, and others. We used the data collected to inductively arrive at six models that characterize modern advanced research approaches. The approaches of these models were different in the sense that some rely on academic and industry collaboration while others revolve around disrupting the status quo. The fact that the companies included in this study were successful means that all the models reflect a useful approach to advanced research. Therefore, no single model should be considered as better or ideal than the other. The models could be of use to a company trying to create an appropriate advanced research approach based on its goals and needs. Similarly, these models could help a company fine tune its existing RandD approach as its goals and identity develop over time. The models we present here provide useful terminology and will serve as backbone for further study of advanced development & corporate research approaches.",Sidhu I.; Lavian T.; Howell V.,Conference Proceeding,"2015 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation/ International Technology Management Conference, ICE/ITMC 2015",2016-03-21,UC Berkeley’s Industrial Engineering and Operations Research Department,advanced development ;  corporate research ;  product and service development

Business model innovation: Focus on customer experience,"Visualization of management tools has become a must in the past decade. Its importance cannot be neglected; visual signs define the direction our brain pays attention to, and therefore affect deeply what and how human beings contemplate their environment. Recent tools in business management such as business models include visual elements to support the attracting of attention. A vast amount of literature has been published to study and examine different business model constructs and their applicability and effectiveness in different contexts. However, scant evidence exists of how elements in a business model construct can support innovation, and how visualization of these elements relates to innovating actions. Business models are mostly focused on the creation and delivery of a customer value proposition, which describes a bundle of products and services. However, this approach is often delimited to existing bundles of products and services. Customer experience emerges from interactions between a firm and its customer, as perceived through a customer's conscious and subconscious mind; it is not just about the 'what' but also about the 'how'. Therefore, customer experience should play a central role in business model innovation. This paper introduces a new business model framework, which focuses the attention on customer experience. In addition to the customer value proposition, customer experience can be considered as an important and hard-to-imitate element of a company's competitive advantage. The proposed model was tested with two start-up company cases and evaluated by three industry experts. The findings demonstrated that by complementing the value proposition with customer experience in a business model construct, the focus also shifts towards customer experience driven business model innovation. The external assessment confirmed the notions from the case workshops, which open promising pathways for further research.",Seppanen M.; Laukkanen I.,Conference Proceeding,"2015 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation/ International Technology Management Conference, ICE/ITMC 2015",2016-03-21,Nokia Corporation;Tampere University,business model innovation ;  customer experience ;  model ;  strategy
Radical innovation of a business model: Is business modelling a key to understand the essence of doing business?,"Purpose – This paper aims to investigate key antecedents to the use of radical innovation of the business model of a service firm to achieve competitive advantage. “Business model” emerged fairly recently as an academic concept, competing with “sustainable strategic competitiveness”, “strategic fit” (Porter, 1996) and “dominant logic” (Prahalad and Bettis, 1986) to give key explanatory understanding of firm performance. Design/methodology/approach – The article is based on action research, in which the re-engineering of a service business turned into radical innovation of the business model. Findings – Radical innovation (conceived of as a new dominant logic) of the business model of a service firm is shown to give sustainable competitive advantage. It shows how fundamental the concept of business model is to understanding the nature of the business and links it to fundamental academic discussion of recent decades around concepts such as “sustainable competitive advantage”, “structural capital” and “tacit knowing”. Research limitations/implications – This is based on a case, and more research is needed to generalize the findings. Practical implications – In contrast to the knowledge management and structural capital evangelization, much tacit knowing cannot be converted to structural capital. Originality/value – Business model is a central concept to understand business performance, but must not be conceived as all-encompassing. We give a model for what the concept should cover and contrast it with other important models.We show the role of tacit knowledge in a business model.",Philipson S.,Journal,Competitiveness Review,2016-03-21,Hogskolan i Gavle,Business model ;  Competitive advantage ;  Fit ;  Structural capital ;  Tacit knowing
Investigation of problems related to open-innovation in research organizations,"Open innovation has become an important topic in innovation management, attracting researchers and those interested in the field of innovation. Among the reasons behind the interest in this field are the shorter cycles of innovation against research and development-scale costs as well as the shortage of resources. The present article aims to identify and investigate open-innovation factors in Iranian Space Agency (ISA). The statistical population of the research includes all employees of research institutes. Pathway analysis has been used in order to investigate the effect of these factors on open-innovation. Pathway analysis results indicated that the fivefold factors crowdsourcing, buying corporation or technology, cooperation and participation, establishing corporation, sale, and technology leakage have meaningful effects on open innovation. It should be noted that the variables corporation-or technology-buying and crowdsourcing have the maximum effect, among the others, on open-innovation in ISA.",Aghayari J.; Parizi M.; Naeini S.; Ehsani R.,Conference Proceeding,"Conference Proceedings of 2015 2nd International Conference on Knowledge-Based Engineering and Innovation, KBEI 2015",2016-03-17,"Islamic Azad University, Science and Research Branch;Transportation Research Institute, Tehran",cooperation and participation ;  corporation-or technology-buying ;  crowdsourcing ;  establishing corporation ;  Open-innovation

Introduction,"This introduction presents an overview of key concepts discussed in this book, which deals with a new perspective on how to use and value unmanned system. Engineering tells how to build things and operations research tells how things should be used. In development of new military hardware, however, engineering nearly always has a head start over operations research. In some systems, centralized human control and cognition may be a much more costly approach, requiring substantially more technological investment, greater manning, and networks with much higher capacity than legacy manned systems. Analyzing this trade space is an area of new growth for operations research. Concurrently and independently, innovations in secure, distributed networking and high-speed computing, the two most basic building blocks of advanced unmanned systems, began to achieve the commercial successes that made unmanned military vehicles seem more viable as a complement to legacy platforms in the fleet, field, and flight-line.",Cares J.; Dickmann J.,Book,Operations Research for Unmanned Systems,2016-03-05,"Sonalysts, Inc.",Distributed networking ;  High-speed computing ;  Operations research ;  Unmanned system

CAD/CAE associative features for cyclic fluid control effect modeling,"Nowadays, CAE has been widely applied in industry as an auxiliary tool for decision making. However, human intervention still is required in reasoning CAE results and in determining design change effect. Ideally, CAD and CAE should be seamlessly integrated where design changes, effect analysis and function reasoning should be explicitly supported by automatic feature extraction in a cyclic manner. This paper presents two CAD/CAE associative feature concepts, which form a robust mechanism aiming to support automatic CAD/CAE interactions with both geometric and semantic information. Firstly, a concept of CAE boundary feature is proposed to model and record the simulation intents, and therefore, the CAE analysis cycles could be managed with the consistent initialization setups, e.g. boundary conditions, mesh types, and physical models. Secondly, CAE results are processed by extracting the differential characteristic features, which are named as CAE effect features. An effective feature reflects the sensitivity information related to each engineering change and hence leads to the evaluation of design modifications. Consequently, the cyclic design modifications can be tracked and reasoned; then further modifications are guided to converge into the optimum. The research innovation lies in the proposed CAD/CAE integration scheme which has been explored preliminarily to demonstrate an automated and efficient way to keep the CAD/CAE semantic consistency over cycles of optimization. A case study about hydraulic valve development is presented.",Li L.; Ma Y.,Journal,Computer-Aided Design and Applications,2016-03-03,University of Alberta,CAD/CAE associative feature ;  CAD/CAE integration ;  CAE boundary feature ;  CAE effect feature ;  design automation
Using knowledge base and DSS to fill the gaps in agile methodologies for managing project life cycles,"Current software development methodologies for projects management are based on last methodologies as Agile.

Towards a digital infrastructure for engineering materials data,"The industrial and research sectors make significant investments in developing and producing engineering materials. These materials are manufactured and qualified in accordance with a body of product and testing standards that have evolved over many decades to meet ever more demanding requirements. Yet the very significant volume of data that result from these activities remains largely unavailable. While efforts to establish a digital infrastructure for engineering materials data can be traced back more than three decades, widespread adoption of machine-readable formats to enable the routine transfer of engineering materials data has yet to be realized. Given the reliance on electronic systems in all aspects of engineering materials development, manufacture, and qualification, it is an anomaly that simply preserving and transferring engineering materials data remains an issue. This anomaly is accentuated by the fact that in recent years other business domains have benefited from the integration of web technologies into established business models. To address these shortcomings a digital infrastructure is needed that allows and encourages the seamless transfer of engineering materials data between different systems. It is in this context that renewed efforts to develop standard formats for engineering materials data are taking place in the frame of CEN Workshops. While building on prior activities at ASTM and ISO, this work leverages existing product and testing standards with a view to engaging the engineering materials community. With preliminary technical specifications having already been demonstrated to streamline the data transfer process, attention is turning to the long-standing challenge of promoting a culture of data sharing. Whereas previously the motivations for researchers and industrial organizations to share data were lacking, the initial impacts of the DataCite framework for data citation on the utilization of the European Commission materials database hosted at https://odin.jrc.ec.europa.eu are suggestive of a sea-change in data sharing and reuse. This paper describes the status of the work to develop data formats for engineering materials in the frame of CEN Workshops and reports on the added value of data citation beyond simply ensuring that data creators are properly accredited for their work. It also reports the outcome of work to enable the European Commission materials database to support standards compliant data formats and data citation, whereby the barriers to systems integration have been considerably reduced and, irrespective of the level of confidentiality, organizations in both the industrial and research sectors now routinely enable their data sets for citation. Together with recent innovations in digital publishing, a renewed interest in the development of standards for engineering materials data offers new prospects for discovery, exchange, and reuse of engineering materials data. Taken along with other data centric initiatives, such as physics-based and multi-scale modelling, Open Data, and linked data, it can reasonably be argued that standard data formats and data publishing herald a transition towards a digital infrastructure for engineering materials data.",Austin T.,Journal,Materials Discovery,2016-03-01,European Commission Joint Research Centre,Data citation ;  Data formats ;  Engineering materials ;  Interoperability ;  Standardization
Status and trends on sci-tech development of agricultural machinery in China,"Agricultural machinery, as the material basis for developing modern agriculture, is an indispensable means for improving agricultural production efficiency, transforming the agricultural development pattern, enhancing the comprehensive competitiveness of agriculture, and ensuring national food security and effective supply of agricultural products. In recent years, in the process of rapid socio-economic growth in rural China, with the effective implementation of agriculture and farmers-friendly policies, agricultural machinery has become a most dynamic industry in the whole machinery sector in the country with daily improved research capacities and industrial technologies, and greatly enlarged product varieties and industrial scale. Under the new circumstances in the country, with the urbanization being accelerated and the rural labor increasingly transferred, development of farm machines suitable for the national conditions in the process of agricultural mechanization shall be the fundamental approach to solve the problem of ""Who farm and how to farm"", in order to meet the requirements in building up the modern agriculture with a sound mode and in a vertical direction. In this review, the paper describes the achievements made in the agricultural machinery and agricultural mechanization, the implementation of the key Sci-Tech planning projects, the innovation of basic applied technologies and key common products, as well as the establishment of four-in-one industrial chain innovation system covering projects, bases, personnel and mechanism in China. It also summarizes the development of the major technologies and products from 7 perspectives such as precision farming and intelligent technologies, farm power and tractors, multifunctional working machines, harvesters, livestock machinery, agro-products and food processing equipment, and agro-forest biomass utilization equipment. In conclusion, the paper indicates the future trends and priorities in the sci-tech development of the agricultural machinery in China from the following four aspects: Strengthening basic research and advancing original innovative capabilities, developing key common technologies and equipment for sound supply of domestic agricultural machinery, upgrading the productivity and quality of high-end equipment, and accelerating going-global for agricultural engineering in the process of the internationalization.",Shujun L.,Journal,"AMA, Agricultural Mechanization in Asia, Africa and Latin America",2016-03-01,China National Agricultural Machinery;International Commission of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering (CIGR),Achievements ;  Agricultural machinery ;  Development ;  Intelligence ;  Technology
Competitive programming: A case study for developing a simulation-based decision support system,"FootballAvatar is an experimental industrial research and development subproject of the project 'SziMe3D-3D technological innovation in tourism, education and sport'. FootballAvatar aims to produce a novel decision support information system based on simulations for professional football clubs. This paper establishes the notion of football avatar in the sense of information technology, though it has a strong mathematical background. However, we would like to apply it in several analytic and simulation software tools developed in our project. The main question is that how this notion could be implemented and used in several software environments including C++, Java, and R, or from an architectural viewpoint, on desktops, smart phones, and tablets, while the kinds of uses and the base definitions have often changed during the R&D phases. This changing of the precise interpretation of the notion of ""football avatar"" has a direct impact on selecting the software process model. For this reason, we have developed an own software methodology called Competitive Programming (CP), which will be presented in detail, as the main result of the present paper. Our main goal with CP was to create a methodology that allows us to work effectively even when the objectives to achieve are changing rapidly. As an example of the application of the methodology, the paper discusses the aforementioned FootballAvatar project.",Bátfai N.; Jeszenszky P.; Mamenyák A.; Halász B.; Besenczi R.; Komzsik J.; Kóti B.; Kövér G.; Smajda M.; Székelyhídi C.; Takács T.; Róka G.; Ispány M.,Journal,Infocommunications Journal,2016-03-01,Debreceni Egyetem Informatikai Kar;DVSC Futball Szervezo Zrt.;SziMe3D Ltd.,Agile programming ;  Competitive programming ;  Football Avatars ;  OSS policy ;  Software process improvement
Expert panel replaces EU chief scientific advisor,"Seven highly acclaimed European scientists now supply the European Commission with timely, independent scientific policy advice, replacing the first and only Chief Scientific Advisor (CSA) in the executive body's history. Active since the start of the year, the Scientific Advice Mechanism (SAM), which includes in its membership Rolf Dieter-Heuer, the former director general of CERN, not only provides its own expert council, but also draws on a wide range of scientific expertise across Europe through a close relationship with national academies and other advisory bodies. Under the new plan, the seven members are appointed for a term of two and a half years that can be renewed only once. They are not employed by the commission but instead are compensated for the days they are needed in Brussels and keep their current jobs, ensuring their positions as independent scientists. The panel's first group of scientists was chosen from a pool of 162 candidates from 74 organizations. The seven members are Polish bioinformatician Janusz Bujnicki, Dutch sociologist Pearl Dykstra, Portuguese materials scientist Elvira Fortunato from the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, British climate researcher Julia Slingo, French mathematician Cedrick Villani, and and Danish microbiologist Henrik Wegner.",Blau J.,Journal,Research Technology Management,2016-03-01,,
An engine for biotech startups- and participants,"Vicki Sato has developed a course, titled 'Commercializing Science' that has stimulated the creation of a number of life science companies, many of them based on class projects. The course is built around three major themes: technology strategy, the design of business models, and leadership. It focuses on such issues as managing risky technological bets, selecting and resourcing projects, building teams and managing scientists in a commercial setting, etc. Each session of the course begins with the case studies typical of Harvard Business School's approach. Beyond providing academic instruction, the course provides important lessons for any would-be entrepreneur or scientific executive. The cases include illustrations of issues that Sato herself faced in her business life.

The use of IP profiles in selecting and structuring R&D alliances,"OVERVIEW: In today's dynamic technology environment, firms in high-tech industries often enter into R&D alliances to overcome internal resource constraints and complement in-house R&D efforts. While alliances may provide valuable opportunities for synergy effects, many projects fail to meet expectations due to inappropriately selected partners. This paper proposes an analytical framework that can help technology managers select suitable partners, especially when they face significant time pressure with limited information. Our framework also supports the formulation of effective technology strategies based on the evaluation of potential alliance candidates via intellectual property (IP) profiles and patent data.",Cho Y.; Lee Y.,Journal,Research Technology Management,2016-03-01,Daegu University;Hanyang University,Partner selection ;  R&D alliances ;  Strategic group map
(I'm a) daydream believer,"Irene J. Petrick belives that our understanding of the world is based on an inner narrative, one that is constructed in our unconscious from bits of data we may never become consciously aware of. That inner narrative is only accessible when we are not paying attention, when we're daydreaming, freeing our mind from external focus so that it can process data and fit it into those internal narratives. Our brain cells obviously communicate when our minds are engaged, but perhaps surprisingly, brain cells are still firing even when the mind is idle. As daydreaming allows us to see the world from other perspectives, it pushes us beyond the confines of our expertise and into insight. Embracing this downtime can allow us to harness all of our brainpower for creative problem solving.",Petrick I.,Journal,Research Technology Management,2016-03-01,TrendScape Innovation Group,
The design process: The beauty and relevance of the fluidity concept within an interdisciplinary team,"We are entering into an era where various co-creation initiatives are emerging between professionals, researchers and practitioners in order to answer ""wicked problem"" dilemmas. Beyond the simple juxtaposition of knowledge within a multidisciplinary approach, designers nowadays are willing to work together towards a merging of knowledge within an interdisciplinary philosophy. This paper aims to study the spaces of confluence where different universes of knowledge, values and practices, specific to co-creation initiatives, meet, mainly in Hackathon projects. Through practical and theoretical lenses, the epistemological and teleological perspectives of co-creation, collaboration and education issues are examined within an interdisciplinary team. The goal is to better understand how creation and techno-scientific knowledge are co-formulated in order to become vectors for social innovation and entrepreneurship.

Mechanical forces are now well-established to provide a physical stimulus to help maintain normal tissue function, yet little is understood as to how forces experienced at various length scales influence cell behaviour and tissue function. In this Research Highlight, we describe recent technical innovations that have enabled advanced insight into the cellular microenvironment across a range of length scales.",Mok S.; Moraes C.,Journal,Integrative Biology (United Kingdom),2016-03-01,Université McGill,
An historical analysis of the California Current circulation using ROMS 4D-Var: System configuration and diagnostics,"The Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) 4-dimensional variational (4D-Var) data assimilation tool has been used to compute two sequences of circulation analyses for the U.S. west coast. One sequence of analyses spans the period 1980-2010 and is subject to surface forcing derived from relatively low resolution atmospheric products from the Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform wind product (CCMP) and the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis project. The second sequence spans the shorter period 1999-2012 and is subject to forcing derived from a high resolution product from the Naval Research Laboratory Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS). The two analysis periods are divided into eight day windows, and all available satellite observations of sea surface temperature and sea surface height, as well as in situhydrographic profiles are assimilated into ROMS using 4D-Var. The performance of the system is monitored in terms of the cost function and the statistics of the innovations, and the impact of data assimilated on the circulation is assessed by comparing the posterior circulation estimates with the prior circulation and the circulation from a run of the model without data assimilation, with particular emphasis on eddy kinetic energy. This is part I of a two part series, and the circulation variability of the 4D-Var analyses will be documented in part II.",Neveu E.; Moore A.; Edwards C.; Fiechter J.; Drake P.; Crawford W.; Jacox M.; Nuss E.,Journal,Ocean Modelling,2016-03-01,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration;University of California, Santa Cruz;University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa;INRIA Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique",4D-Var ;  California Current ;  Data assimilation
Undesirable congestion under natural disposability and desirable congestion under managerial disposability in U.S. electric power industry measured by DEA environmental assessment,"This study discusses a new use of DEA environmental assessment to measure a possible occurrence of desirable congestion, or eco-technology innovation, in electric power plants. The phenomenon is compared with an occurrence of undesirable congestion in this study. The identification of undesirable congestion is important to avoid a cost increase and a shortage of generation. However, the identification of desirable congestion is much more important than that of undesirable congestion from the perspective of environmental assessment. This study looks for a sustainable economic growth by identifying eco-technology innovation that can be effectively used to reduce the amount of air pollution so that electric power companies satisfy a governmental standard on environmental protection. The proposed approach is applied to evaluate the performance of coal-fired power plants in the United States. This study finds two policy implications. First, power plants operated by bituminous coal (i.e., black coal) outperform those with sub-bituminous coal (i.e., brawn coal). The result implies that power plants with sub-bituminous coal should be replaced by bituminous coal. Second, the undesirable congestion, due to a line limit between points of power generation and consumption, may occur on most of coal-fired power plants. In contrast, desirable congestion, due to eco-technology innovation, may occur on a limited number of power plants. Thus, the identification of desirable congestion assists us in selecting which technology, or the type of power plant, should be invested to facilitate eco-technology innovation and its related engineering management for a future sustainable economic growth.",Sueyoshi T.; Goto M.,Journal,Energy Economics,2016-03-01,Institute of Science Tokyo;New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology,Congestion ;  DEA ;  Electric power industry ;  Environmental assessment

Establishing a system for innovation in a professional services firm,"Professional service firms are facing new competitive challenges in a global market with more value-focused clients, service commoditization, regulatory changes, and new Internet-enabled business models. They increasingly need to improve competitiveness through sustained innovation of the value they provide and the efficiency with which they provide it. But how can firms establish an effective and sustainable innovation system? This Executive Digest shares a best practice model for innovation based on academic research and honed by a decade of practical experience in application across professional service firms in consulting projects. This work covers how to develop innovation strategies by establishing processes and organization to support innovation, providing innovation training, developing new services, and re-engineering existing services. The author, Alastair Ross, details the practices required and shares some of the challenges encountered in realizing them.

Augmented Reality Gaming in Sustainable Design Education,"It is important for students in academic disciplines related to building design and construction to gain an understanding of the different sustainable design considerations that will affect a building's performance. Additionally, it is important for these students to be able to generate, visualize, and assess the performance of alternative design options to determine the best possible approach. The research presented in this paper tasked students with performing a building redesign activity in which they had to design, visualize, and assess exterior wall designs to retrofit an existing facility and improve its sustainable performance. It was of interest to understand how augmented reality and simulation game technologies would influence students' design processes during the activity. To measure student performance, 34 architectural engineering students, 47 architecture students, and 27 civil engineering students were given the same design activity using an augmented reality-based educational game called ecoCampus. The results of their work were compared with those of 65 students who completed a similar design activity using only blank sheets of paper and of another group of 23 students who used a paper-based approximation of the computerized ecoCampus. The findings indicate that students in all disciplines who used ecoCampus were able to break the tendency toward design fixation. These students were also able to use the application to assess their designs and generate additional concepts with better overall performance across all disciplines compared with the students who used paper-based formats. Although these observed behaviors were beneficial, the students who used ecoCampus also demonstrated a tendency to experiment with the application and occasionally create unrealistic, novelty designs to try to break the game. The findings from this work will help inform future efforts to leverage augmented reality and simulation game technologies for other use cases to allow users to assess what-if design scenarios in which they might otherwise be prone to design fixation.",Ayer S.; Messner J.; Anumba C.,Journal,Journal of Architectural Engineering,2016-03-01,Penn State College of Engineering;Arizona State University,Augmented reality ;  Educational game ;  Engineering education ;  Innovation ;  Sustainability
Towards understanding variety in knowledge intensive business services by distinguishing their knowledge bases,"Knowledge intensive business services (KIBS) are known to play a significant role in innovation systems. Past research has however mostly treated KIBS as a homogenous group; it is now time to understand better the variety that exists among KIBS. In this study, we apply a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods to examine a dataset of 362 UK-based KIBS firms active in three 'sectors': architecture and engineering consulting; specialist design; and software and IT consulting. By applying content analysis techniques to information drawn from firms' websites, we identify each firm's primary 'knowledge base', be that analytical, synthetic or symbolic knowledge. We then relate the firms' primary knowledge base to their engagement in R&D, design, and innovation, and examine how the 'drivers' of innovation vary between firms with different primary knowledge bases. The paper thereby contributes to the literature, first by identifying empirically 'knowledge bases', then relating these to the variety that exists among KIBS. The paper concludes by highlighting issues for further conceptual, methodological and empirical research.",Pina K.; Tether B.,Journal,Research Policy,2016-03-01,Alliance Manchester Business School,Content analysis ;  Diversity ;  Innovation ;  Knowledge bases ;  Knowledge intensive business services (KIBS)
How firms collaborate with public research organizations: The evolution of proximity dimensions in successful innovation projects,"Although public research organizations (PROs) are potentially valuable collaboration partners for firms in the development of innovations, most firms find it difficult to develop and sustain fruitful collaborations with PROs. Proximity dimensions, such as geographical, cognitive, organizational, and social proximity, are important facilitators of inter-organizational collaboration. Nevertheless, our understanding of the interaction between and evolution of different proximity dimensions over time is limited. Based on a longitudinal study of 15 successful innovation projects involving firms and PROs as collaboration partners, we find that different proximity dimensions are important for the establishment of new collaborations, depending on a firm's characteristics. While engineering-based firms tend to rely on geographical and social proximity to PROs, science-based firms rely more heavily on cognitive and organizational proximity. Moreover, we observe that firms with initial social and geographical proximity to PROs can sustain and expand their collaborations by developing cognitive and organizational proximity over time.",Steinmo M.; Rasmussen E.,Journal,Journal of Business Research,2016-03-01,Nord Universitet,Engineering-based firms ;  Innovation projects ;  Proximity dimensions ;  Public research organizations ;  Science-based firms ;  Universities
Like a bridge over troubled water - Opening pathways for integrating social sciences and humanities into nuclear research,"Research on nuclear technologies has been largely driven by a detachment of the 'technical content' from the 'social context'. However, social studies of science and technology - also for the nuclear domain - emphasize that 'the social' and 'the technical' dimensions of technology development are inter-related and co-produced. In an effort to create links between nuclear research and innovation and society in mutually beneficial ways, the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre started fifteen years ago a 'Programme of Integration of Social Aspects into nuclear research' (PISA). In line with broader science-policy agendas (responsible research and innovation and technology assessment), this paper argues that the importance of such programmes is threefold. First, their multi-disciplinary basis and participatory character contribute to a better understanding of the interactions between science, technology and society, in general, and the complexity of nuclear technology assessment in particular. Second, their functioning as (self -)critical policy supportive research with outreach to society is an essential prerequisite for policies aiming at generating societal trust in the context of controversial issues related to nuclear technologies and exposure to ionising radiation. Third, such programmes create an enriching dynamic in the organisation itself, stimulating collective learning and transdisciplinarity. The paper illustrates with concrete examples these claims and concludes by discussing some key challenges that researchers face while engaging in work of this kind.",Turcanu C.; Schröder J.; Meskens G.; Perko T.; Rossignol N.; Carlé B.; Hardeman F.,Journal,Journal of Environmental Radioactivity,2016-03-01,SCK CEN,Multi-disciplinary research ;  Nuclear research ;  Science and technology studies
Social capital to facilitate 'engineered' university-industry collaboration for technology transfer: A dynamic perspective,"Over the last decade, social capital concept has received considerable amount of research being regarded as an important value creation mechanism. However, we still have limited understanding about the nature of interaction between the dimensions of this capital, and how it can be useful in mitigating the impediments evolving during government-sponsored (i.e., engineered) university-industry collaboration (UIC). In this paper, we address the previous gap by analyzing the dynamics of social capital dimensions during the preformation and postformation stages of UIC. The paper relies on a unique context that comprises five embedded case studies of UIC for technology transfer: the Faraday Partnership Initiative, a UK government-backed novel scheme for enhancing innovation. The analysis shows that the impact and interaction of the dimensions were not static but rather varying over time. Further, we present a new value creation framework for social capital through mapping its power in reducing the intensity of difficulties emerged during the collaboration lifetime. We also identify two facilitating factors as critical in creating and maintaining social capital in engineered UIC. The present study thus contributes to a deeper understanding of the value of inter-organizational social capital.",Al-Tabbaa O.; Ankrah S.,Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2016-03-01,University of Huddersfield;Independent Reader of Research,Inter-organizational relationship ;  Social capital dimensions ;  Technology transfer ;  University-industry collaboration
"Architecting complex international science, technology and innovation partnerships (CISTIPs): A study of four global MIT collaborations","Complex international partnerships have emerged as a policy instrument of choice for many governments to build domestic capacity in science, technology and innovation with the help of foreign partners. At present, these flagship initiatives tend to be primarily practitioner-driven with limited systematic understanding of available design options and trade-offs. Here, we present an analysis of four such partnerships from the university sector between the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and governments in the UK, Portugal, Abu Dhabi, and Singapore. Using a system architecture approach in conjunctions with in-depth case studies and elements of interpretive policy analysis, we map how in each country distinct capacity-building goals, activities, and political and institutional contexts translate into different partnership architectures: a bilateral hub-&-spokes architecture (UK), a consortium architecture (Portugal), an institution-building architecture (Abu Dhabi), and a functional expansion architecture (Singapore). Despite these differences in emergent macro-architectures, we show that each partnership draws on an identical, limited set of 'forms' that can by organized around four architectural views (education, research, innovation & entrepreneurship, institution-building) and four levels of interaction between partners (people, programs/projects, objects, organization/process). Based on our analysis, we derive a design matrix that can help guide the development future partnerships through a systematic understanding of available design choices. Our research underscores the utility and flexibility of complex international partnerships as systemic policy instruments. It suggests a greater role for global research universities in capacity-building and international development, and emphasizes the potential of targeted cross-border funding. Our research also demonstrates the analytic power of system architecture for policy analysis and design. We argue that architectural thinking provides a useful stepping stone for STS-type interpretive policy analysis into national innovation initiatives in different political cultures, as well as more custom-tailored approaches to program evaluation.",Pfotenhauer S.; Wood D.; Roos D.; Newman D.,Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2016-03-01,"MIT School of Engineering;TUM School of Management, Munich;Massachusetts Institute of Technology;Johns Hopkins University",Innovation policy ;  International partnerships ;  MIT ;  Policy design ;  Regional development ;  Research collaboration ;  System architecture ;  University partnerships
"The evaluation of creativity from the perspective of subject matter and training in higher education: Issues, constraints and limitations","Creativity in organizations is presented as a phase of innovation and is a crucial issue at the core of the economic system. In the area of economics and management, it is acknowledged that auditing the creative process ensures the longevity and competitiveness of companies. Research indicates how creativity could be evaluated and controlled, but debate is intensive and many critiques have been formulated. In this article, we invite readers to consider an interdisciplinary approach emphasizing the importance of contextualizing research on the evaluation of creativity and the perspectives of training in higher education. From a discipline-oriented posture, evaluating creativity in research requires taking into account methodology frameworks and prudence with regard to social and cultural contexts. Creativity is addressed critically, primarily questioning its very definition and the aims of the evaluation. With regard to work on the subject, we explore the evaluation dimension of creativity and identify three potential invariants that could enter into interdisciplinary dialogue on the creative process. In the discussion, we address crucial points stemming from the learning process of creativity among engineering students in higher education where the challenge is to develop one's creative potential.",Fischer S.; Oget D.; Cavallucci D.,Journal,Thinking Skills and Creativity,2016-03-01,Centre Interuniversitaire de Recherche en Education de Lille (CIREL);INSA Strasbourg,Creativity ;  Evaluation ;  Higher education ;  Learning ;  Professionalization
Re-inventing engineering curriculum,"The strengths and weaknesses of the traditional engineering education in the context of today's industry needs has been a focus of the professional institutions and learned societies over the last decade. The need to broaden the engineering curriculum to equip engineering graduates with skills and attributes for them to succeed professionally, to foster creativity and innovation and to thrive in a multi-disciplinary context is recognised. The role of engineers in revitalising national economies has also been discussed widely. This paper captures the results of research undertaken with support from industry. A conceptual model for engineering curriculum is proposed incorporating design thinking and business skills. The undergraduate engineering curriculum at London South Bank University was redeveloped based on these concepts.

Leading the way to enterprising futures: A response to the engineering skills gap,"This paper describes and demonstrates the value of the Sheffield Engineering Leadership Academy (SELA), in the Faculty of Engineering, University of Sheffield, UK, in responding to the widely recognised skills gap amongst engineering graduates. The unique and ambitious programme prepares a select group of undergraduate students with the skills and confidence to become engineering leaders of tomorrow, who can create positive change in industry and research. It brings together an international cohort of students from a range of engineering disciplines, supported by a network of industry experts, academic colleagues, enterprise educators and engineering alumni, who deliver training, coaching and leadership preparation to the students. Over two years, the students benefit from training, development and mentoring opportunities in enterprise, innovation, business and project management, all contextualised within engineering. Following an initial skills bootcamp, the students complete two separate year-long inter-disciplinary collaborative projects, and undertake two placements in industry or research. Enterprise skills are embedded into the programme, with students facing authentic challenges that require them to generate new ideas and proactively realise them to provide solutions. Students must be resourceful and confident to strategically take advantage of opportunities to create positive outcomes, whilst recognising and working within constraints, facing and managing risk and uncertainty, and dealing with change.",Nicholson H.; Wood G.,Book,Engineering and Enterprise: Inspiring Innovation,2016-02-24,The University of Sheffield,Engineering ;  Enterprise ;  Leadership ;  Skills gap ;  Training
Grand challenges in transportation and transit systems,"Transportation and transit systems draw upon broad spectra of research fields due to the diversity and interconnectivity of transport modes, including road, rail, aviation, pipeline, maritime, or even aerospace. These systems have evolved over centuries to be considerably more efficient and environment-friendly for a wide range of customers. The fundamental principle “safety first” is still the key priority in most research today. However, thanks to extensive interface with various customers; research and innovation in practices have shifted from optimizing functional purposes and targets through each stage of life cycle toward modernization, reliability, resilience, and better quality of life.

The impact of EngD-Dynamics of collaborative relationships through employer engagement in doctoral research training,"The important role of doctoral engineers as the next generation of scientific and technology leaders, who will underpin the competitiveness of the industry base, has been recognised among international R & D stakeholders and policy makers. In the UK, the Engineering Doctorate (EngD) programme was established 20 years ago as a scheme distinct from, and complementary to, the traditional PhD. The EngD is differentiated from PhD programmes as it expects doctoral researchers (Research Engineers: REs) to work closely with industry, by helping researchers acquire industry relevant skills as well as industry based research experience, while based in a company. This chapter draws on a pilot study conducted in 2013, which investigated the various forms of impacts resulting from EngD programmes-including the perceptions of business partners who fund research projects and host the REs, and the career destinations of the former REs. Four key routes to impacts are proposed as a conceptual framework in order to understand the variety of impacts of the collaborative doctoral training.",Kitagawa F.,Book,Engineering and Enterprise: Inspiring Innovation,2016-02-24,University of Edinburgh Business School,Employer engagement ;  Engineering doctorates ;  Human capital ;  Innovation ;  Skills
A study on the impact of multidisciplinary collaboration on computational thinking,"This paper reports on a multi-semester study of the impact on student perceptions of their computational thinking abilities as a result of collaboration between students in computer science (CS) and journalism courses to solve a problem for a community partner, Habitat for Humanity. Interdisciplinary computing collaborations have become a popular mode of instruction in upper-level CS courses. In many cases, these collaborations have been with other STEM disciplines. However, there are non-STEM fields that have been transformed by computer science and can also serve as fruitful test beds for curricular innovation; journalism is one such field. In this study, undergraduate students in CS and journalism courses focused on creating a computational solution to address a real community need. The study investigates whether immersion in multidisciplinary collaborative experiences increases the computational thinking abilities of both CS and non-CS students. 41 CS students participated in the study alongside 96 students in a range of other STEM and non-STEM majors. Quantitative data were collected to gauge students' attainment of concepts and skills constitutive to computational thinking. Pre-test data indicate that CS students were no different from other STEM students in their own assessment of computational thinking and skills. Post-test data indicate that while all students made significant gains in self-assessment of skills and knowledge, CS majors fared significantly better than their peers. It is particularly noteworthy that CS majors' gains outpaced those of computer engineering majors. Further research is planned to gain additional insight into the possible reasons behind these results.",Pulimood S.; Pearson K.; Bates D.,Conference Proceeding,SIGCSE 2016 - Proceedings of the 47th ACM Technical Symposium on Computing Science Education,2016-02-17,The College of New Jersey,Collaboration ;  Community engaged learning ;  Computational thinking

"In vitro tumor models: Advantages, disadvantages, variables, and selecting the right platform","In vitro tumor models have provided important tools for cancer research and serve as low-cost screening platforms for drug therapies; however, cancer recurrence remains largely unchecked due to metastasis, which is the cause of the majority of cancer-related deaths. The need for an improved understanding of the progression and treatment of cancer has pushed for increased accuracy and physiological relevance of in vitro tumor models. As a result, in vitro tumor models have concurrently increased in complexity and their output parameters further diversified, since these models have progressed beyond simple proliferation, invasion, and cytotoxicity screens and have begun recapitulating critical steps in the metastatic cascade, such as intravasation, extravasation, angiogenesis, matrix remodeling, and tumor cell dormancy. Advances in tumor cell biology, 3D cell culture, tissue engineering, biomaterials, microfabrication, and microfluidics have enabled rapid development of new in vitro tumor models that often incorporate multiple cell types, extracellular matrix materials, and spatial and temporal introduction of soluble factors. Other innovations include the incorporation of perfusable microvessels to simulate the tumor vasculature and model intravasation and extravasation. The drive toward precision medicine has increased interest in adapting in vitro tumor models for patient-specific therapies, clinical management, and assessment of metastatic potential. Here, we review the wide range of current in vitro tumor models and summarize their advantages, disadvantages, and suitability in modeling specific aspects of the metastatic cascade and drug treatment.",Katt M.; Placone A.; Wong A.; Xu Z.; Searson P.,Journal,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,2016-02-12,Johns Hopkins Department of Biomedical Engineering;Whiting School of Engineering;The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center;Johns Hopkins University,Metastasis ;  Microvessel models ;  Spheroids ;  Transwell assay ;  Tumor models

Exposed Aquaculture in Norway,"Farming of Atlantic salmon in exposed areas poses unique challenges to operations, structures and equipment due to severe and irregular wind, wave and current conditions, and sheer remoteness. Many of the operational challenges seen at present sheltered sites are likely to be amplified when moving production to more exposed locations. There is, however, a strong Norwegian industrial interest in utilizing such areas. A new research center, the Exposed Aquaculture Operations center has been initialized to develop competence and technology to address the challenges. Six core research areas are identified that will be crucial to address the challenges with exposed farming, with a focus on the industrial status in Norway. Four areas target technological innovations that will enable safe and reliable exposed aquaculture operations: 1) Autonomous systems and technologies for remote operations, 2) Monitoring and operational decision support, 3) Structures for exposed locations and 4) Vessel design for exposed operations. Two areas represent core requirements for sustainable production: 5) Safety and risk management and 6) Fish behavior and welfare.

"Mother and children health reporting system: Innovative information system application in the rural West Bandung Area, Indonesia, by using multimodal communications systems","Objectives: Digitalization of maternal and post-natal care system (DigiMAPS) is a system consist of electronic medical record for mother and children health (KIA) also for tele-consultation facility called Tele-Obgyn. Our project focuses on the development of KIA Online and a cloud computing-based video conferencing as a basis of Tele-Obgyn platform. The web-based network allows online access not only among primary health care but also between government and private institution. DigiMAPS platform is designed to meet the needs of database management and its interphase with other services that are responsible for data acquisition and visualization. Methods: DigiMAPS combines the open-source flexible system design that benefits for implementation and development needs as well as support for mobile devices to enable high quality of patient care. The system has been developed gradually following lean-innovation management concept which focuses on customer-problem-solution matching with rapid prototyping and validation from idea to solution. There was significant effort to establish a close relationship and learning process with prospective users of DigiMAPS, hence in the broader perspective we used a participatory research approach. DigiMAPS act as central-portal and -data base in the communication information system (ICT), designed to compile patient report paperless and equipped with tele-consultation. Results: DigiMAPS developed for a variety of administrative processes. This system will simplify the work process and can be integrated with primary health care system, Health Department and the Ministry of Health. A good ICT will be useful in collecting clinical information than conventional paper-based reporting system and to minimize errors in the reporting chain. Conclusions: By using lean innovation management, several inputs are gathered from prospective users including health authority, head of local clinics, midwifes, obgyn doctors, and public health staffs. Our system may bridging gap between clinical needs and digital documentation, telemedicine-monitoring and improve the quality of patient care, facilitate communication within both the scope of the internal (primary health care) and external (stakeholders and follow-up), increasing productivity and reduce overall expenses.",Faried A.; Sutiono A.; Djuwantono T.; Arifin M.; Wirakusumah F.; Yuniarto S.; Hariyanto H.; Jayadi Y.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2015 4th International Conference on Instrumentation, Communications, Information Technology and Biomedical Engineering, ICICI-BME 2015",2016-02-08,Universitas Padjadjaran;Innovation and Design Centre,Digitalization of maternal and post-natal care system (DigiMAPS) ;  eHealth Cloud Computing ;  Information Communication System (ICT) ;  Medical IT
"Noise and artifact reduction based on EEMD algorithm for ECG with muscle noises, electrode motions, and baseline drifts","As the number of ageing population and cardiovascular diseases increased, innovations in electrocardiogram (ECG) recording devices with more compact design and capability to be operated while user moving freely and comfortably are needed to help monitoring cardiac activity. Despite of its advantages, the high mobility of ECG leads to the increasing of motion artifacts and baseline drifts which then become another challenge to be overcome. A method based on Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) algorithm is proposed in this research for reducing noises and artifacts caused by motion, e.g. muscle movement, baseline drifts, and electrode motions. Testing was done by generating noisy signal using three types of noise recordings (taken from MIT-BIH Noise Stress database) and normal ECG recordings (taken from MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database with normal annotations), which each type of noisy signals divided into five noise levels i.e. 2, 6, 10, 14, and 18 dB. The performance of proposed method was then evaluated qualitatively by asking opinion from qualified general practitioners and quantitatively by calculating the SNR values. The output signals are then compared with output from Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). As the results, for three types of noise tested, the ECGs are qualitatively tolerable for being used for diagnosis if the SNR are equal or above 9 dB. According to that, proposed method is effective for reducing muscle noise and electrode motion artifacts with noise levels 6 dB and 10 dB in which the output SNR increased around 9 dB or more. For baseline drifts, this method performs very well for noisy signal with noise levels 2 dB, 6 dB, and 10 dB.",Atrisandi A.; Adiprawita W.; Mengko T.; Lin Y.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2015 4th International Conference on Instrumentation, Communications, Information Technology and Biomedical Engineering, ICICI-BME 2015",2016-02-08,Institut Teknologi Bandung;National Taiwan University of Science and Technology,baseline drifts ;  electrocardiogram (ECG) ;  electrode motion ;  ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) ;  muscle noise
Design Structure Matrix Extensions and Innovations: A Survey and New Opportunities,"The design structure matrix (DSM), also called the dependency structure matrix, has become a widely used modeling framework across many areas of research and practice. The DSM brings advantages of simplicity and conciseness in representation, and, supported by appropriate analysis, can also highlight important patterns in system architectures (design structures), such as modules and cycles. A literature review in 2001 cited about 100 DSM papers; there have been over 1000 since. Thus, it is useful to survey the latest DSM extensions and innovations to help consolidate progress and identify promising opportunities for further research. This paper surveys the DSM literature, primarily from archival journals, and organizes the developments pertaining to building, displaying, analyzing, and applying product, process, and organization DSMs. It then addresses DSM applications in other domains, as well as recent developments with domain mapping matrices (DMMs) and multidomain matrices (MDMs). Overall, DSM methods are becoming more mainstream, especially in the areas of engineering design, engineering management, management/organization science, and systems engineering. Despite significant research contributions, however, DSM awareness seems to be spreading more slowly in the realm of project management.",Browning T.,Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2016-02-01,Texas Christian University,Dependence structure matrix ;  design structure matrix (DSM) ;  domain mapping matrix (DMM) ;  literature survey ;  multidomain matrix (MDM) ;  organization architecture ;  process architecture ;  product architecture
The integration of quality function deployment and Kansei Engineering: An overview of application,"As a result of today's globalized world and robust development of emerging markets, consumers are able to select from an endless number of products that are mostly similar in terms of design and properties, as well as equivalent in function and performance. The survival of businesses in a competitive ambience requires innovation, consumer loyalty, and products that are easily identifiable by consumers. Today's manufacturers have started to employ customer research instruments to survive in the highly industrialized world-for example, Conjoint Analysis, Design of Experiments and Semantic Design of Environment. However, this work only attempts to concentrate on Kansei Engineering and Quality Function Deployment. Kansei Engineering (KE) is deemed as the most appropriate method to link consumers' feelings, emotions or senses to the properties of a product because it translates people's impressions, interests, and feelings to the solutions of product design. Likewise, Quality Function Deployment (QFD) enables clearer interpretation of the needs of consumers, better concepts or products, and enhanced communication to internal operations that must then manufacture and deliver the product or services. The integration of both KE and QFD is believed possible, as many product manufacturers and businesses have started to utilize systematized methods to translate consumers' needs and wants into processes and products. Therefore, this work addresses areas of various integrations of KE and QFD processes in the industry, in an effort to assist an integration of KE and QFD. This work aims to provide evidence on the integration mechanism to enable successful incorporation of consumer's implicit feelings and demands into product quality improvement, and simultaneously providing an overview of both KE and QFD from the perspective of a novice.",Lokman A.; Awang A.; Omar A.; Abdullah N.,Conference Proceeding,AIP Conference Proceedings,2016-02-01,Universiti Teknologi MARA,Integration ;  Kansei Engineering ;  Quality Function Deployment ;  Quality Improvement Method
Current status and development prospect of petroleum engineering bionics,"This paper detailedly introduces the development status of bionics in petroleum engineering, proposes the concept of petroleum engineering bionics, points out the necessity to establish this subject, summarizes the characteristics and research methods of petroleum engineering bionics, and systematically analyzes its development trend. Up till now, the application of bionics has achieved substantial progresses in drilling, pipeline, wellbore and other fields. The future research on petroleum engineering bionics should adopt scientific methods to gradually deepen the research results in three stages, i.e., biological prototype stage, mathematical model stage and engineering realization stage, so as to avoid the complexity of imitation as much as possible and enhance the invention and innovation during simulation. Petroleum engineering bionics should also take the technical requirement in oil production as a fundamental starting point to improve the existing technical system or create a new one for hierarchical staged application research. Innovative solutions and technical methods are provided for breaking through key technologies in functional materials, surface performance, information acquisition and processing, engineering realization and etc. A bionic technical system covering exploration, development and engineering will be gradually created through three stages, i.e., knowledge accumulation, achievement transformation and industrial application.",Liu H.; Yang Q.; Pei X.; Zheng L.; Fu T.; Shi B.; Wei S.; Chen L.,Journal,Shiyou Xuebao/Acta Petrolei Sinica,2016-02-01,Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration and Development,Bionic technical system ;  Bionics ;  Engineering bionics ;  Information bionics ;  Material bionics ;  Petroleum engineering bionics ;  Surface bionics
Research on the advanced measures for large span tunnel in dense dry fine sand stratum,"Research purposes: In the construction process of Shangbai tunnel in Datong-Xi'an Passenger Dedicated Line, tunnel face presents dense dry fine sand stratum, lenticular, and disturbance produced sand leakage and sand gushing, unable to form the desired contour, so there is a higher risk. The main performance is that the cohesion is low, the disturbance of a short time accumulates piles, and can not form the arch effect; high sensitivity, damage is often instantaneous, sudden, prone to cavities, which generally form cavity from the soil sand boundaries. In view of the existing problems, the measures need to be studied to ensure the tunnel face stability and construction safety by means of what measures to reinforce the dense dry fine sand stratum, to form the arch effect and tunnel face stability and control of subsidence and deformation. Research conclusions: (1) Make full use of high pressure jet grouting to mix fine sand with cement, recombine the rock mass structure, and form cyclic concretion body to solve the construction problems. (2) Realizing the mechanized construction of the large section of the weak stratum is the guarantee of realizing the basic requirements of the ""six in one"" modern construction management. (3) It remove the pipe-shed studio, which has simple process, less interference, easy operation and high efficiency. (4) Horizontal rotary jet grouting pile in advance reinforcement can protect the surrounding rock and form cyclic concretion body around the scheduled tunnel, which has the advantages of large stiffness, high strength and strong controllability in the construction. Preliminary arch after excavation can play a role, to ensure the safety of construction and control the high risk tunnel construction risk, which is innovation and breakthrough in the technical field of construction. (5) As a new technology in the consolidation of the pipe shed, the smaller diameter of the pile adding pipe shed makes up for the construction defects of the consolidation, inhibits the settlement and deformation, and has low investment, good stress, safety in construction and other advantages, which can be further promoted and applied.",Wang L.,Journal,Journal of Railway Engineering Society,2016-02-01,The Third Railway Survey and Design Institute Group Corporation,Advanced reinforcement ;  Fine sand stratum ;  Super-large span ;  Tunnel
Do inventors talk to strangers? on proximity and collaborative knowledge creation,"This paper examines the characteristics of the collaborations between inventors in the United Kingdom (UK) by looking at what types of proximities - geographic, organisational, cognitive, social, and cultural-ethnic - between inventors are prevalent in partnerships that ultimately lead to technological progress. Using a new panel of UK inventors this paper provides an analysis of associations between these 'proximities' and co-patenting. The results show that while collaboration within firms, research centres and universities remains crucial, external networks of inventors are key feature of innovation teams. The analysis shows that external networks are highly dependent on previous social connections, but are generally unconstrained by cultural or cognitive factors. Geographical proximity is also weakly linked with external networks. Our results suggest that innovation policies should, rather than focus on spatial clustering, facilitate the formation of open and diverse networks of inventors.",Crescenzi R.; Nathan M.; Rodríguez-Pose A.,Journal,Research Policy,2016-02-01,University of Birmingham;London School of Economics and Political Science,JEL classification O31 ;  O33 ;  R11 ;  R23
Knowledge creation in collaboration networks: Effects of tie configuration,"This paper studies the relationship between egocentric collaboration networks and knowledge creation at the individual level. For egocentric networks we focus on the characteristics of tie strength and tie configuration, and knowledge creation is assessed by the number of citations. Using a panel of 1042 American scientists in five disciplines and fixed effects models, we found an inverted U-shaped relationship between network average tie strength and citation impact, because an increase in tie strength on the one hand facilitates the collaborative knowledge creation process and on the other hand decreases cognitive diversity. In addition, when the network average tie strength is high, a more skewed network performs better because it still has a ""healthy"" mixture of weak and strong ties and a balance between exploration and exploitation. Furthermore, the tie strength skewness moderates the effect of network average tie strength: both the initial positive effect and the later negative effect of an increase in tie strength are smaller in a more skewed network than in a less skewed one.",Wang J.,Journal,Research Policy,2016-02-01,KU Leuven;Georgia Institute of Technology;Institute for Research Information and Quality Assurance (IFQ),Egocentric networks ;  Knowledge creation ;  Organization of science ;  Research collaboration ;  Tie configuration ;  Tie strength
Methods for cost estimation in software project management,"The speed in which the processes used in software development field have changed makes it very difficult the task of forecasting the overall costs for a software project. By many researchers, this task has been considered unachievable, but there is a group of scientist for which this task can be solved using the already known mathematical methods (e.g. multiple linear regressions) and the new techniques as genetic programming and neural networks. The paper presents a solution for building a model for the cost estimation models in the software project management using genetic algorithms starting from the PROMISE datasets related COCOMO 81 model. In the first part of the paper, a summary of the major achievements in the research area of finding a model for estimating the overall project costs is presented together with the description of the existing software development process models. In the last part, a basic proposal of a mathematical model of a genetic programming is proposed including here the description of the chosen fitness function and chromosome representation. The perspective of model described it linked with the current reality of the software development considering as basis the software product life cycle and the current challenges and innovations in the software development area. Based on the author's experiences and the analysis of the existing models and product lifecycle it was concluded that estimation models should be adapted with the new technologies and emerging systems and they depend largely by the chosen software development method.",Briciu C.; Filip I.; Indries I.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2016-02-01,Universitatea Politehnica Timisoara,

Roadblocks to responsible innovation: Exploring technology assessment and adoption in U.S. public highway construction,"U.S. public highway construction industry professionals are responsible for assessing and adopting new technology that can improve the cost and quality of roadways. This paper investigates features of the technology assessment and adoption process in the U.S. public highway construction industry that both facilitate and hinder responsible innovation. Often technological innovations are incongruent with current specifications, i.e., regulatory construction standards, whereby specification reform serves as a precursor to implementation. We examine this aspect of technology assessment and adoption through a novel application of Kingdon's theory of policy agenda setting to a highly technical state bureaucratic institution using a case study on Intelligent Compaction. Specification reform relating to Intelligent Compaction is occurring in nearly a quarter of U.S. states. Analysis of interviews with industry professionals revealed that institutional incentives for supporting innovations were not the main drivers for adoption, and there exists a conservative culture that inhibits change. Individuals that go against this grain by championing change do so based on their personal character, ideological affiliations and a perceived sense of social obligation, which coincides with the principles set forth in the responsible research and innovation literature. These individuals, whom we identify as Kingdon's policy entrepreneurs, appear to present themselves in four roles in this industry: explorer, pioneer, gatekeeper, and leader. Our findings indicate that alignment of these roles creates an environment conducive to responsible technology assessment and adoption, and therefore greater societal benefit. Ultimately, we hope this study will benefit U.S. Highway Construction Industry regulatory environments by enhancing identification of specification processes, key roles, and personal/ethical ideologies that may be conducive to fostering a culture of responsible innovation.",Kimmel S.; Toohey N.; Delborne J.,Journal,Technology in Society,2016-02-01,"Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc.;Colorado School of Mines;NC State University",Agenda setting ;  Highway construction ;  Innovation adoption ;  Kingdon ;  Policy entrepreneurs ;  Policy reform ;  Responsible research and innovation ;  Technology assessment
The innovative hybrid Cell-Truss Spar Buoy Platform for moderate water depth,"The Hybrid Cell-Truss Spar Buoy Platform, a relatively new technology for floating structures, is studied for the Andaman Sea, that has deeper water and fault line on the seabed, despite the dominant shallow water in Southeast Asian region. This innovative Spar Buoy Platform offers many advantages, such as lower construction cost (CAPEX), a reuse option after service life, lower decommissioning costs and is suitable for use in marginal fields. This research studies three prototype models: Mono Cell-Truss Spar, Three- and Four-Cells-Truss Spar Platforms for water depths of 200 m, 400 m and 600 m, which are subjected to a 10-year and 100-year return period sea-states. The study is focused on hydrostatic stability for stationary keeping systems; while mooring analysis, hydrodynamic analysis and analysis of the structural strength of the platform are conducted as usual in design stage. The dynamic response analyses are conducted in time domain for assessing the serviceability performance of the models. Conclusively, all prototype Spar Platforms are suitable for operation in the Andaman Sea. Nevertheless, the Hybrid Cell-Truss Spar Platforms with three cells-trusses and four cells-trusses will perform with more stability and with lower dynamic responses than that of the Mono Cell-Truss Spar Buoy Platform.",Sinsabvarodom C.; Widjaja J.,Journal,Ocean Engineering,2016-02-01,Asian Institute of Technology Thailand;Konkuk University,Cell spar ;  Floating structure ;  Hybrid spar ;  Offshore structure ;  Spar platform ;  Truss spar
Support for organizational change: Change-readiness outcomes among AEC project teams,"A major area of innovation within the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry involves the re-engineering of project delivery processes, yet successful implementation of such processes requires a significant organizational change effort. The AEC industry is often regarded as a laggard in the uptake of innovation, and personnel resistance to change is among the most commonly cited barriers to change adoption. The objective of this study was to understand the extent to which project level personnel change readiness is affected by a variety of antecedents within 16 AEC owner organizations, each of which independently implemented a planned strategic change in their project delivery processes. An outcome-oriented perspective of change readiness was incorporated to empirically document behavioral response to change at the individual level (n=96) among owner project managers and contracting officers. Change readiness outcomes were measured via an action research method in relation to contextual, personnel, content, and process antecedents present prior to change implementation on each AEC project. Results indicated that change management process factors of increased change message delivery and extensive change agent involvement had the greatest effect on outcomes of high change readiness. Individual experience and project scope considerations also had a relationship with change readiness, although to a far lesser extent. Contributions of this study include an empirical, multiorganization, real-time data set of change implementation within the AEC industry, identification of significant antecedent effects on personnel change readiness outcomes, and associated recommendations for change practitioners. Future research is recommended to investigate additional personnel-oriented characteristics of project teams and their corresponding relationship to change readiness.",Lines B.; Sullivan K.; Wiezel A.,Journal,Journal of Construction Engineering and Management,2016-02-01,University of Kansas;Arizona State University,Organizational issues
Impact of energy technology patents in China: Evidence from a panel cointegration and error correction model,"Enhancing energy technology innovation performance, which is widely measured by energy technology patents through energy technology research and development (R&D) activities, is a fundamental way to implement energy conservation and emission abatement. This study analyzes the effects of R&D investment activities, economic growth, and energy price on energy technology patents in 30 provinces of China over the period 1999-2013. Several unit root tests indicate that all the above variables are generated by panel unit root processes, and a panel cointegration model is confirmed among the variables. In order to ensure the consistency of the estimators, the Fully-Modified OLS (FMOLS) method is adopted, and the results indicate that R&D investment activities and economic growth have positive effects on energy technology patents while energy price has a negative effect. However, the panel error correction models indicate that the cointegration relationship helps to promote economic growth, but it reduces R&D investment and energy price in the short term. Therefore, market-oriented measures including financial support and technical transformation policies for the development of low-carbon energy technologies, an effective energy price mechanism, especially the targeted fossil-fuel subsidies and their die away mode are vital in promoting China's energy technology innovation.",Li K.; Lin B.,Journal,Energy Policy,2016-02-01,Xiamen University;Hunan Normal University,China ;  Energy price ;  Energy technology patents ;  Panel cointegration model ;  R&D activities
"Teaching-as-research internships: a model for the development of future chemistry faculty and the improvement of teaching in science, technology, engineering, and math","Over the past decade, the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison) and Madison Area Technical College (Madison College) partnered to create an internship pathway for graduate students pursuing careers as future science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) faculty members. Since 2003, 10 doctoral students from the university completed teaching internship appointments with the technical college chemistry department. Interns benefited from a variety of teaching and educational experiences that helped lay the foundations for their future teaching careers. Following completion of their internships, many students secured employment in higher education as new instructors and enthusiastic members of the teaching profession. Intern projects also benefited veteran faculty mentors at Madison College, and the experience provided a rich forum for collaboration that generated curricular and instructional innovations in the classroom. Centered on the three pillars of teaching-as-research, learning community, and learning through diversity, the internship program created at UW-Madison and implemented at Madison College provides a model pathway for preparing future STEM faculty. This approach provides clear benefits not only for the future faculty who are trained, but also for veteran faculty mentors, for the host institution, and for the undergraduate students impacted by the educational innovations. This paper examines the key attributes of this program, with the hope that our experience may be disseminated and replicated to benefit others.",Gillian-Daniel D.; Walz K.,Journal,Community College Journal of Research and Practice,2016-02-01,Madison Area Technical College;University of Wisconsin-Madison,
Finite Element Method for forecasting the diffusion of photovoltaic systems: Why and how?,"The Finite Element Method (FEM) has been used in the broad field of continuum mechanics in engineering disciplines for several decades. However, recently, some scholars have attempted to apply the method to social science phenomena. What is the scope of using FEM in social science-related fields? Anchored in the literature on social sciences, this paper, firstly, reviews the scope of using FEM in social science phenomena, and then applies FEM to a semi-hypothetical case study on the diffusion of solar photovoltaic systems in southern Germany. By doing so, the paper aims to shed light on why and how the Finite Element Method can be used to forecast the diffusion of solar photovoltaic systems in time and space. Unlike conventional models used in diffusion literature, the computational model considers spatial heterogeneity. The model is based on a partial differential equation that describes the diffusion ratio of photovoltaic systems in a given region over time. The results of the application show that the FEM constitutes a powerful tool by which to study the diffusion of an innovation as a simultaneous space-time process.",Karakaya E.,Journal,Applied Energy,2016-02-01,Universidad Politécnica de Madrid;The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH),Adoption ;  FEM ;  Innovation ;  Renewable energy ;  Simulation ;  Spatiotemporal

Systems consultation: Protocol for a novel implementation strategy designed to promote evidence-based practice in primary care,"Background: Adoption of evidence-based practices takes place at a glacial place in healthcare. This research will pilot test an innovative implementation strategy - systems consultation -intended to speed the adoption of evidence-based practice in primary care. The strategy is based on tenets of systems engineering and has been extensively tested in addiction treatment. Three innovations have been included in the strategy - translation of a clinical practice guideline into a checklist-based implementation guide, the use of physician peer coaches ('systems consultants') to help clinics implement the guide, and a focus on reducing variation in practices across prescribers and clinics. The implementation strategy will be applied to improving opioid prescribing practices in primary care, which may help ultimately mitigate the increasing prevalence of opioid abuse and addiction. Methods/Design: The pilot test will compare four intervention clinics to four control clinics in a matched-pairs design. A leading clinical guideline for opioid prescribing has been translated into a checklist-based implementation guide in a systematic process that involved experts who wrote the guideline in consultation with implementation experts and primary care physicians. Two physicians with expertise in family and addiction medicine are serving as the systems consultants. Each systems consultant will guide two intervention clinics, using two site visits and follow-up communication by phone and email, to implement the translated guideline. Mixed methods will be used to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of the implementation strategy in an evaluation that meets standards for 'fully developed use' of the RE-AIM framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance). The clinic will be the primary unit of analysis. Discussion: The systems consultation implementation strategy is intended to generalize to the adoption of other clinical guidelines. This pilot test is intended to prepare for a large randomized clinical trial that will test the strategy against other implementation strategies, such as audit/feedback and academic detailing, used to close the gap between knowledge and practice. The systems consultation approach has the potential to shorten the famously long time it takes to implement evidence-based practices and clinical guidelines in healthcare.",Quanbeck A.; Brown R.; Zgierska A.; Johnson R.; Robinson J.; Jacobson N.,Journal,Health Research Policy and Systems,2016-01-27,University of Wisconsin-Madison;University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health,Clinical guideline adoption ;  Implementation strategies ;  Systems engineering

Exploring the potential of introducing technology innovation and regulations in the energy sector in China: A regional dynamic evaluation model,"The Chinese government has introduced stricter environmental regulations to address the rapid increase in Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and environmental deterioration associated with energy demand. In this research we analyze the potential environmental and socio-economic benefits of introducing such regulations coupled with the promotion of advanced technological innovation for power generation. We selected Chongqing city, one of the most polluted cities in China, as the case study. The study proposes 5 scenarios that range from baseline to technology promotion through the introduction of carbon tax and subsidy schemes and the implementation of regulations for regional air emissions reduction. We constructed a dynamic evaluation model based on an Input-Output (I/O) analysis for the period 2010-2025. The results show an overall benefit on the quality of the environment and energy conservation efforts. The study demonstrates that the introduction of regulations without promotion of technological innovation will dramatically affect economic growth. The results also show that innovations in the energy sector alone will reduce both air pollutants and energy intensity to a certain extent. In this regard the promotion of innovation in other economic sectors is necessary. Another important finding is the fact that the introduction of regulations will actually curb air emissions and energy consumption. This research provides a strong platform for policy makers to realize the urgency and importance of promoting technology innovation through environmental regulations.",Zhou Q.; Yabar H.; Mizunoya T.; Higano Y.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2016-01-20,University of Tsukuba,Air pollution ;  Cleaner power technology ;  Energy conservation ;  Environmental regulation ;  GHG emissions ;  Technology innovation

"Anti-migration enhanced tracheal stent design, rapid manufacturing and experimental tests","Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to focus on tracheal stent production with the aim of investigating the available devices and improving their performances. The biomedical field is a continuously growing area of the market always in search of the most innovative and competitive solutions for healthcare. Beside the actual critical period of the world economy, it shows continuous improvements in research and innovation. Design/methodology/approach-Within a market analysis and the collaboration between engineering and biomedical research fields, it was outlined a new product concept able to satisfy the patients and physicians requirements with the focus on the enhancement of the stent anchorage. As a result, the concept of a custom- or tailor-made stent was identified as a potential solution. Moreover, additive technologies were identified as the economically sustainable processes for manufacturing these innovative stents. In the present paper, different types of stents were derived from the proposed concept, they were designed, manufactured and their anchorage capability was tested. In particular, the procedures adopted for their design are described and discussed. Moreover, silicone fused deposition modelling was adopted and two types of deposition method, namely, layer-by-layer and continuous, were used to manufacture the devices identifying their pro, cons and limits. Finally, the stents were tested against migration and results were compared with one of the most widely used today. Findings-The results show how additive manufacturing allowed to manufacture more efficient and migration resistant stents. Originality/value-It is expected that this new stent design will reduce the risk of complications in stenting, as granulation, thanks to a more uniform stress distribution on the trachea tissues. These improved characteristics will allow to enhance the quality of both the product and the patients healthcare.",Fiorentino A.; Piazza C.; Ceretti E.,Journal,Rapid Prototyping Journal,2016-01-18,"Dipartimento di Specialità Medico-Chirurgiche, Scienze Radiologiche e Sanità Pubblica;Università degli Studi di Brescia",Anti-migration ;  Experimental test ;  Medical products ;  Product design ;  Rapid manufacturing ;  Tracheal stent
How do tourism firms innovate for sustainable energy consumption? A capabilities perspective on the adoption of energy efficiency in tourism accommodation establishments,"Previous studies demonstrate the role of firm capabilities in the adoption of environmental innovations and sustainability measures. However there remains a gap in understanding how particular combinations of capabilities may give rise to different patterns of innovation adoption across firms in the tourism industry. The study addresses this gap by advancing insights on the capabilities of tourism accommodation establishments to adopt environmental technologies and measures in their maintenance and operational activities; and the extent to which tourism firms exploit their relation with a type of business partner (engineering consulting firms in this study) to appropriate knowledge about environmental innovations and build absorptive capacity. For this purpose, the research builds a qualitative study on the adoption of energy efficiency measures in hotels in Malta, a Mediterranean tourism destination. The findings demonstrate different patterns of innovation adoption amongst the firms in terms of the range of energy technologies and measures adopted that are contingent on the firms' particular combination of capabilities to solve problems around energy efficiency; and to accumulate knowledge about energy solutions through creating spaces for innovation adoption. Tourism firms that build internal capabilities for adoption of energy efficient measures and technologies are more likely to mobilize their relation with engineering firms in order to co-produce innovative energy efficient solutions. The policy implication is that policy measures should increasingly promote the development of capabilities for energy management alongside programmes that are focussed on the diffusion of environmental technologies.",Pace L.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2016-01-16,Alliance Manchester Business School,Capabilities ;  Energy efficiency ;  Engineering consulting firms ;  Environmental innovation ;  Tourism accommodation establishments

Conventional pharmaceutical manufacturing processes do not adequately address the needs of military and civilian patient populations and healthcare providers. Recent advances within the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Battlefield Medicine program suggest that miniaturized, flexible platforms for end-to-end manufacturing of pharmaceuticals are possible. Advances in continuous-flow synthesis, chemistry, biological engineering, and downstream processing, coupled with online analytics, automation, and enhanced process control measures, pave the way for disruptive innovation to improve the pharmaceutical supply chain and drug manufacturing base. These new technologies, along with current and ongoing advances in regulatory science, have the future potential to (1) permit ""on demand"" drug manufacturing on the battlefield and in other austere environments, (2) enhance the level of preparedness for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats, (3) enhance health authorities' ability to respond to natural disasters and other catastrophic events, (4) minimize shortages of drugs, (5) address gaps in the orphan drug market, (6) support and enable the continued drive toward precision medicine, and (7) enhance access to needed medications in underserved areas across the globe. Conclusion. Modular platforms under development by DARPA's Battlefield Medicine program may one day improve the safety, efficiency, and timeliness of drug manufacturing.",Lewin J.; Choi E.; Ling G.,Journal,American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy,2016-01-15,"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency;The Johns Hopkins Hospital;Strategic Analysis, Inc.",
Building engineering e-learning grid to foster engineering aptitude and Engineering attitude by leveraging ICT,"Today each and every country is facing the challenge to keep up its competitive advantage vis a vis other countries. They have realized the importance of innovation, research and development as necessary tools to keep them competitive and build their leadership position. Engineers play a pivotal role in building such sustainable competitive advantage for the country by providing solutions to the various technical and social issues. There is a strong need in country like India to build engineering pool with high caliber of Engineering attitude and aptitude. This pool will provide the requisite capability to create innovative solutions in various technical fields. The challenge being faced by academic institutes is how to provide engineering educations which will enable them to build such pool. The convergence of information and communication technologies (ICT) is providing such enabling platform for these institutes. They can build collaborative learning environment and link it to the education grid for engineers. This paper focuses on how an e-learning grid can be created and collaborative learning environment can be established in the various engineering collages and ICT can be leveraged which will facilitate in building research oriented mindset and high caliber engineers with high aptitude to find solutions to problems. This paper will provide the guidelines on what engineering institutes should do to leverage the ICT technologies and how they can build collaborative learning environment and contribute to the national engineering e-learning grid.",Walia H.; Katiyar S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 2015 International Conference on Green Computing and Internet of Things, ICGCIoT 2015",2016-01-12,Galgotias College of Engineering & Technology;GNIT Group of Institutions,collaborative learning environment ;  e-learning Grid ;  learning content ;  new ways in Education ;  virtual laboratories
Web technologies integrated with advance database management system: A laboratory experience,"In current engineering education scenario, new ideas, innovation in teaching and learning are necessary to develop students for employment and research acumen. The challenge for us as course facilitator is to utilize the existing potential that information technology offers to prepare our students for this information revolution. In this regard, we have proposed an integrated learning framework by considering two courses, web technologies laboratory (WT) and advance database management systems (ADBMS) of sixth semester in information science department at undergraduate level to make students apply knowledge effectively in building real time applications. The key focus of integrated learning was attainment of focused outcomes b, c, g and k (ABET criteria).We are elated that we attained outcome i as a bonus, although it was not focused. In this paper, we show that integrated learning framework led to attainment of focused outcomes, improved skills in students such as presentation skills, teamwork skills, and problem solving skills. This also led to performance improvement in examination and increased student's confidence level. This makes students to stand out in crowd and acquire an edge in competition.",Patil P.; Shettar P.; Akki M.; Sunag B.; Meena S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE 3rd International Conference on MOOCs, Innovation and Technology in Education, MITE 2015",2016-01-07,KLE Technological University,ADBMS ;  WT
Decoding the Indian MOOC learner,"Massive Open Online Courses have been looked at both as disruptive innovation as well as the biggest experiment in education in recent times. 15 Million learners have turned to MOOCs as in 2014 and Indians constitute the second largest share of the MOOC user base. This paper attempts to understand some of the essential characteristics that distinguish a MOOC user from a non-user in India. A proprietary survey for understanding MOOC consumers has been used to draw insights on demographics of potential MOOC users including age, occupation, gender, educational backgrounds as well as some salient aspects of their personality, learning styles and life goals. Three logistic regression models have been tested. The first model investigates the impact of background demographic variables and internet skills of respondents on the choice to enroll in at least one MOOC course. The second model includes key personality traits that are hypothesized to influence the user adoption of MOOCs and the full modeladdsvariables pertaining to learning styles, learning environment and life goals. Those with better internet skills and an existing preference for learning through videos were seen to be significantly more likely to adopt MOOCs. Personality traits aligned with an openness to try new things were seen to influence the adoption decision but the learning styles and learning environment did not differentiate users from non-users. The results also indicate a significant influence of gender and age.",Kaveri A.; Gunasekar S.; Gupta D.; Pratap M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE 3rd International Conference on MOOCs, Innovation and Technology in Education, MITE 2015",2016-01-07,Amrita School of Business,Indian online learning ;  learning on MOOC ;  learning styles ;  logistic regressions ;  MOOC users ;  online learning ;  personality
Distance education and MOOC: Opportunities for quality education in higher education in Mauritius,"We are witnessing a learning community who is always willing and eager to be associated to innovative practices online. With the Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC), developing countries are given new opportunities to be part of the global community with access to a wider range of resources and expertise from leading universities around the world. But these resources cannot be integrated in programmes without investigating on their pertinence and their value added factor. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to analyze the actual distance education systems in Mauritius and to outline strategies on how MOOC can be used effectively in order to revitalize higher education and lifelong learning by giving access to quality complementary resources. As methodology, the evolution of distance education in Mauritius is analyzed as well as the growth of MOOC. Furthermore a framework of the integration of MOOC in a new form of education that transcends boundaries is proposed for a developing country like Mauritius. It is found that, for innovation to be effective, it needs to find its way in the existing valued solid foundations that were inbuilt.",Panchoo S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE 3rd International Conference on MOOCs, Innovation and Technology in Education, MITE 2015",2016-01-07,"University of Technology, Mauritius",feedback ;  framework ;  interactions ;  learning activities ;  learning analytics ;  learning processes ;  MOOC ;  quality education
Active learning approaches to teach Intellectual Property Rights,Student centered active learning methodology of teaching is proved to be an effective method of teaching the millennial students. Intellectual property is critical to nurturing innovation in engineering domain and hence is a part of the engineering education curriculum. The course on Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) was traditionally taught with a teacher centered technique. Through this paper an attempt is made to teach IPR through different active learning techniques and analyze the outcomes. The results include the attainment of Program Outcome (POs) through the Course Outcomes (COs). The comparison of the attainment before and after adopting active learning techniques substantiates that the active learning methodology has catered the students in enhancing their ideas with respect to the nuances of IPR.,Gururaj C.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE 3rd International Conference on MOOCs, Innovation and Technology in Education, MITE 2015",2016-01-07,B.M.S.

Diffusion of green building guidelines as innovation in developing countries,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to comprehend the ways of knowledge and application of green building guidelines and assessment systems as innovations diffuse in developing countries Architecture Engineering and Construction (AEC) industries. Design/methodology/approach Building up on recent research on the India case, this study focused on Indonesia and Turkey and further studied ""how green building assessment systems diffuse in developing countries"".Atotal of 110 experts representing individuals from private and governmental sectors from both countries responded to the conducted survey. Findings Findings show insights to adoption of green building guidelines in developing countries, including their diffusion paths, barriers to their use and their applications. Additionally, the results are compared with the India case from the recent literature and analysed via the lens of the diffusion of innovation theory. Research limitations/implications A random sampling of the AEC industries in developing countries in future studies and capturing of the evolution of the trends over time will provide further insights into the diffusion of innovation phenomena in the context of green building guidelines. Practical implications Innovation adoption paths for green building guidelines in Indonesia, Turkey and India are similar, while a higher adoption rate is observed in the case of India. ""Diffusion of innovation"" categories for green building guidelines that define the state of each adopter at the time of survey conduct in India, Indonesia and Turkey are found. Environmental groups as innovator, large business houses as early adopter and nodal agencies as early majority are the common adopters and categories of green building guidelines. The study findings align with those in the literature and show that clients and market conditions can catalyse the diffusion of innovation in AEC industries in Turkey and Indonesia. Social implications Diffusion of green building guidelines as innovations in developing countries AEC industries showed alignment with the Rogers (2003) model. However, respondents in both Turkey and Indonesia reported approximately ten times as many innovators and twice as many early adopters as Rogers (2003) model would predict. Because of the small proportions of late adopters and laggards in these two countries, any useful innovation should be quickly incorporated. Originality/value Aligning with the literature, findings show that clients and market conditions catalyse diffusion of innovation in AEC industries in Turkey and Indonesia. It is important to note that both countries approximately have ten times as many innovators and twice as many early adop ters as theory would predict. Because of the small proportions of late adopters and laggards in these two countries, useful green building innovations could be quickly incorporated.",Mollaoglu S.; Chergia C.; Ergen E.; Syal M.,Journal,Construction Innovation,2016-01-04,Michigan State University;İstanbul Teknik Üniversitesi,Diffusion ;  Green building guidelines ;  Innovation ;  Sustainability
Transformative learning: innovating sustainability education in built environment,"Purpose – This paper aims to evaluate how transformative learning is key to innovating sustainability education in the built environment in the region’s universities, in addition to reporting on the research project undertaken to integrate sustainability thinking and practice into engineering/built environment curricula in Asia-Pacific universities. Design/methodology/approach – The project drew from the experiences of academics in built environment programmes and espoused a collaborative inquiry process wherein the role of the industry was vital. A literature review focusing on sustainability integration into curricula was followed by a workshop which brought together academic and industry participants. Findings – The general direction of education for sustainability is moving increasingly towards integration and innovation. However, the slow progress of integration of sustainability in the built environment curricula may have been due in part to the outcome/practice-led approach of built environment education, which is the hallmark of the discipline and lends to a largely discipline-based curriculum framework. Research limitations/implications – The project focused only on the curricula of university programmes and courses taught in the participating Asia-Pacific universities and institutions. Practical implications – This paper highlights how the framework for the proposed curriculum guide focusing primarily on built environment programmes and courses can provide guidance for potential application in other higher education institutions. Originality/value – Much is written about embedding sustainability and education in built environment curricula. However, little analysis, application and collaborative work in Asia-Pacific universities have taken place. This paper considers the value of transformative learning in the innovation of the predominantly discipline-based engineering/built environment programmes for sustainability.",Iyer-Raniga U.; Andamon M.,Journal,International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education,2016-01-04,"RMIT University, School of Property, Construction and Project Management",Asia-Pacific ;  Built environment education ;  Curricula ;  Higher education ;  Sustainability education ;  Transformative learning
"Literacy, Media, Technology: Past, Present and Future","Literacy, Media, Technology considers the continued significance of popular culture forms such as postcards, film, television, games, virtual worlds and social media for educators. Following multiple pathways through technological innovation, the contributors reflect on the way in which digital and portable devices lead to new and emerging forms of reading, participating and creating. Rejecting linear conceptualisations of progression, they explore how time is not linear as technological advances are experienced in multiple ways linked to different personal, social, political and economic trajectories. The contributors describe a range of practices from formal and informal education spaces and interrogate some of the continuities and discontinuities associated with literacy, media and technology at a time when rapidly evolving communicative practices often meet intransigence in educational systems. The chapters adopt diverse forms: historical perspectives, personal story and reflection, project reports, document analysis, critical reviews of resources, ethnographic accounts, and analyses of meaning-making within and beyond educational institutions. Together, they provide multiple insights into the diverse and fluid relationships between literacy, media, technology, and everyday life, and the many ways in which these relationships are significant to educational research and practice.",Parry B.; Burnett C.; Merchant G.,Book,"Literacy, Media, Technology: Past, Present and Future",2016-01-01,Sheffield Hallam University;University of Nottingham;United Kingdom Literacy Association,

Top Management Team Heterogeneity Influence on Technological Innovation-The Empirical Analysis on the IT Enterprises from Six Central Provinces,"In today’s increasingly complex economic environment, the developments of enterprises rely more and more on the strength of senior management team. Especially for the IT companies, who rely on the high-tech development. This article analyzes the influence of the heterogeneity in TMT’s education background, age, and working years on technological innovation, depending on the data collected from IT industry from six central provinces. The empirical research shows that the heterogeneity of term and degree will have positive effect on the enterprise technological innovation, while the heterogeneity of age has no significant influence on technological innovation. The IT enterprises from six provinces should absorb the talents who have different education background, accept the new members and make full use of their intelligence to improve the enterprises technological innovation ability and promote competitiveness.",Wang Z.; He Q.; Zhou P.,Conference Proceeding,"15th Wuhan International Conference on E-Business, WHICEB 2016",2016-01-01,Wuhan Textile University,heterogeneity ;  IT companies ;  technological innovation ;  the six central provinces ;  top management team
Robotics Competitions and Challenges,"This chapter explores the use of competitions to accelerate robotics research and promote science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. We argue that the field of robotics is particularly well suited to innovation through competitions. Two broad categories of robot competition are used to frame the discussion: human-inspired competitions and task-based challenges. Human-inspired robot competitions, of which the majority are sports contests, quickly move through platform development to focus on problem solving and test through game play. Task-based challenges attempt to attract participants by presenting a high aim for a robotic system. The contest can then be tuned, as required, to maintain motivation and ensure that the progress is made. Three case studies of robot competitions are presented, namely robot soccer, the UAV challenge, and the DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) grand challenges. The case studies serve to explore from the point of view of organizers and participants, the benefits and limitations of competitions, and what makes a good robot competition. This chapter ends with some concluding remarks on the natural convergence of human-inspired competitions and task-based challenges in the promotion of STEM education, research, and vocations.",Nardi D.; Roberts J.; Veloso M.; Fletcher L.,Book Series,Springer Handbooks,2016-01-01,School of Computer Science;Sapienza Università di Roma;Queensland University of Technology;Boeing Research and Technology Australia,Autonomous Vehicle ;  Defense Advance Research Project Agency ;  Grand Challenge ;  Humanoid Robot ;  Unmanned Aircraft
The Brooklyn Navy Yard revived: A defense conversion case study in the United States,"For nearly 165 years, the Brooklyn Navy Yard in New York built some of the most famous ships in the US Navy’s history. It also served as a center for research and innovation, including in engineering and medicine, and it was a major engine for economic development in the surrounding community. The 300-acre Brooklyn Navy Yard is situated between the Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridges on the East River located in what is now known as Brooklyn’s dumbo district. The Brooklyn navy yard development corporation (BNYDC) replaced commerce labor industry in the county of kings (CLICK) in 1981, but the Yard’s fortunes did not turn around until the late 1990s. According to Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, “The Brooklyn navy yard is an economic engine for our borough and beyond, producing the jobs of today and the innovations of tomorrow”. The long timescale of redevelopment has enabled uses to evolve and management to respond to new ideas.",Preble C.; Clark C.,Book,Sustainable Regeneration of Former Military Sites,2016-01-01,Cato Institute,
The Constitution of a Responsible Research and Innovation Policy: Tensions in Implementation and Regulation,"European scientific and technological policy recommends better aligning the process and results of activities of research and engineering with the values, needs, and expectations of European society. Nevertheless, this progressive intensification of the narrative, as a response to demands for greater responsibility, must contend with other present discourses that function as ideological prescriptions and envisage innovation as a motor for economic competitiveness. There is a basic tension that is clear in the apparent paradox of the new social context of scientific-technological activity, which, on the one hand, is subject to a growing demand for responsible models of research and innovation, and on the other hand, is implemented for macroeconomic results. Our analysis strategy is to reclaim this issue, which is closely linked to the interests that intersect in the generation of knowledge, the criteria that govern the dynamics of the scientific-technological system, and the values that guide scientific policy. Within this basic tension we find a myriad of heterogeneous elements that sometimes contradict each other and that compete amongst themselves for alternative ways to implement and regulate the dynamics of the system of science, technology and innovation. The model of research and innovation developed by European and national policies in response to global challenges is created through the management of this tension.",Eizagirre A.,Journal,Politica y Sociedad,2016-01-01,Mondragon Unibertsitatea,Governance ;  Policy ;  Responsible research and innovation ;  Values
Curricular Innovations at the Intersection of Subsistence and Sustainability,"“The challenge of education is to prepare students for their future – not our past” – Anonymous We have pioneered the area of subsistence marketplaces, creating unique synergies between research, teaching, and social initiatives (www.business.illinois.edu/subsistence ). Distinct from relatively macro-level business approaches to poverty, (e.g., BoP), we adopt a micro-level approach to gain bottom-up understanding of life circumstances of subsistence consumer, entrepreneur and marketplace behaviors. The term, subsistence marketplaces, reflects understanding these contexts in their own right, not just as markets to sell to, but as individuals, communities, consumers, entrepreneurs, and marketplaces to learn from. This program first led to a yearlong, innovative inter-disciplinary graduate-level course on sustainable product and market development for subsistence marketplaces with international immersion, offered since 2006–07. Students in business, engineering, industrial design and other areas spend the Fall semester understanding subsistence marketplaces through virtual immersion (poverty simulation, analysis of interviews of subsistence individuals, analysis of life circumstances in subsistence, development of conceptual models of poverty, needs, products, market interactions, and local environments) in this context and through emersion of business, design, and engineering principles. Interdisciplinary student groups work on organizational projects, generating and evaluating possible ideas for solutions to problems, and prepare for field research. The class travels for immersion in the context and to conduct market research during part of the winter break. Students observe households, marketplaces, and communities in urban and rural subsistence contexts and interview various stakeholders. A prototype and a comprehensive business plan are developed in the spring semester. This course sequence was ranked one of the top entrepreneurship courses by Inc. magazine in 2011, serving as a unique platform for bottom-up innovations for companies and social enterprises in 33 projects to date over 8 years. Insights from projects are being implemented by some sponsor enterprises and a student group has won a prestigious design award. Students earn a certificate in sustainability based on their accomplishments. Based on this experience, we designed a module on developing sustainable businesses for subsistence contexts in a Business 101 course in 2007, then scaled for all incoming first semester undergraduate students (approximately 600). Since 2008, we also designed and offer Sustainable Marketing/Business Enterprises for first year MBAs focusing on environmental sustainability and business, with an online version for undergraduate students. We also designed and teach an executive MBA course on Global Business Horizons, focused on subsistence and sustainability since 2011, and a first semester course for undergraduate engineering students entitled Engineering for Global Development since 2012. Our curricular innovations have led to early exposure and later integrative experiences on subsistence and sustainability for undergraduate and graduate students and executives, which challenge them to confront radically different contexts and envision a better world. In 8 years, the Illinois business curriculum has been transformed, reaching almost 800 students annually. An eBook entitled Subsistence Marketplaces serves as an ideal text for this content area and created a web portal for educators around the world to disseminate materials and encourage curricular innovations in this area (day in the life videos, movie, multi-media immersion exercises, qualitative interviews, project reports). An online version of the course is reaching students around the world through Coursera, with the first iteration having close to 9,000 students. In terms of educational philosophy, our curricular innovations challenge students to confront global problems and envision a better world, adopting a conception of business that focuses on finding win-wins between different dimensions of sustainability while acknowledging trade-offs, and emphasizing a pragmatic focus on doing sustainability. Our courses emphasize bottom-up innovation that inverts traditional top-down business planning and implementation to consider understanding and design of solutions that begin with the perspective of the end-user, the subsistence consumer or entrepreneur, the communities and the larger context. We emphasize bottom-up teaching approaches and numerous different ways of learning, such as through enabling students to connect the dots for themselves across the world through international immersion, the epitome of experiential learning experiences. Finally, our teaching is highly synergized with research and social initiatives, highlighting the close linkage between creation and dissemination of knowledge as well as public engagement. Our work has had profound impact on businesses and social enterprises, business education, and subsistence populations, and has been multiplied by our work in social enterprise. We founded the Marketplace Literacy Project (http://www.marketplaceliteracy.org ), designing and offering a unique marketplace literacy program in India, currently being scaled to reach large audiences using video-based approaches, with pilot efforts in other countries. Supplementing previous work on market access and financial resources, marketplace literacy enables subsistence consumers and entrepreneurs to adapt to changing marketplaces and engage in sustainable practices. Through this program, the discipline of Marketing reaching people who likely will never have access to a university. Grounded in fundamental Marketing notions of customer orientation, our work has led to pioneering innovations to address the global challenges of our generation that impact educators, students, and subsistence communities around the world.",Viswanathan M.,Book Series,Developments in Marketing Science: Proceedings of the Academy of Marketing Science,2016-01-01,University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,Curriculum Innovation ;  International Immersion ;  Literary Marketplace ;  Subsistence Marketplaces ;  Subsistence Populations
Sustainable Consumption Through Innovative Use: Marke Eigenbau in the Former East Germany,"The problems of over-consumption, environmental degradation, and depletion of resources have initiated research in the area of sustainable consumption. The basic premise of sustainable consumption seeks to address the negative impacts of dominating consumption patterns in affluent countries and their need to substantially reduce their consumption to achieve sustainability (Schrader and Thorgersen, 2011). With this macro-level problem in mind, researchers have focused on the roles and responsibilities of both companies and consumers. On the consumer side, two perspectives prevail. First, consumers can choose environmentally friendly products and ‘green’ consumption (Moisander, 2007). The second perspective is that consumers can consume less or even choose not to consume. These perspectives entail a moral obligation and personal commitment to downscale consumption to reduce or eliminate negative externalities on people and the environment (Press and Arnould, 2009). Consumer-centric and company-centric viewpoints are both necessary. With this research, we take a consumer-centric approach. More specifically, we are interested in consumption that is less wasteful. We look back in time to the days of the former East Germany and examine behavior commonly known as Marke Eigenbau (loosely translated as ‘Do-It-Yourself Brand’). Recent discussions have highlighted Marke Eigenbau as a movement against mass production, however, research has not realized Marke Eigenbau to its fullest potential, and thus we analyze Marke Eigenbau in the light of sustainable consumption and the lessons that can be learned from a society with limited resources. In this exploratory study, we use an interpretive methodological approach (Lincoln and Guba, 1985), which allows us to investigate consumers’ use-innovative approaches to produce their own goods and extend product lifecycles in DIY efforts. Data was collected in areas of the former East Germany. Twelve informal, unstructured interviews assisted us in developing our final interview guidelines. These guidelines were then used for twenty formal interviews with informants who had experiences from living in a planned economy, which shaped their current consumption behaviors. Interviews were conducted in German, digitally recorded and transcribed in German (and later translated into English). Informants were interviewed in their homes or at local coffee shops. Informants varied in ages from 27–77 years old and interview times ranged between one and two hours. This study identifies three preliminary themes that illustrate how consumers sought meaning to their DI Y activities; (1) Scarcity – the driver for innovation: To fill the void of unavailable but desired consumer goods, East Germans became efficient in collecting and reusing products in very innovative ways. Our informants stated that rarely were things thrown away even when the product didn’t serve its intended purpose. Eventually, out served goods were integrated with innovativeness, frugality, and ingenuity became national values and the productive ownership and creation of things was elevated to a virtue. Scarcity was seen as a challenge to the industriousness of a culture that prided itself on its engineering and scientific ability. (2) Self-expression through Marke Eigenbau: Marketing was limited in the command economy. People could only buy what the state deemed important. Variety was sacrificed for the sake of efficiency. For instance, there was mainly one type of car, the Trabant. But, this didn’t stop East Germans from modifying their Trabants to fit their own sense of style and uniqueness. The need for uniqueness and variety trumped the need for efficiency so, again, East Germans turned to DIY activities. (3) Meaning and purpose for old material possessions: Our data analysis illustrate that DIY behavior infused meaning into objects allowing each object to represent a story of its creation, use, and in many cases the maintenance and improvement of the object over time. This is partially a result of the immense personal effort and innovativeness that goes into not only purchasing, but also maintaining goods. This reflects a different culture of ownership of material possessions than what we see in the West. The labor spent maintaining, improving, and sometimes stylizing vehicles made the ownership more personal. In conclusion, in terms of sustainability, Marke Eigenbau, as practiced in East Germany, is somewhat different than modern DIY. Products, for example, were usually assembled from an assortment of whatever materials the East Germans had available and often involved a painstaking process to find the materials necessary to even begin the project. This inadequate supply and the nonexistence of home improvement stores make Marke Eigenbau a subject of unique consumer behaviors. We discuss how this research can be applied in a world where raw materials are becoming scarcer and in a world where sustainability and the preservation of the environment are becoming increasingly important.",Wolf M.; Albinsson P.; Kopf D.,Book Series,Developments in Marketing Science: Proceedings of the Academy of Marketing Science,2016-01-01,Appalachian State University;University of Wisconsin-Whitewater;The University of Southern Mississippi,
"Semi-automatic Technology Roadmapping Composing Method for Multiple Science, Technology, and Innovation Data Incorporation","Since its first engagement with industry decades ago, technology roadmapping (TRM) is taking a more and more important role for competitive technical intelligence (CTI) in current R&D planning and innovation tracking. Important topics for both science policy and engineering management researchers involves with approaches that refer to real-world problems, explore value-added information from complex data sets, fuse analytic results and expert knowledge effectively and reasonable, and demonstrate to decision makers visually and understandably. The growing variety of Science, Technology, and Innovation (ST&I) data sources in the Big Data Age increases these challenges and opportunities. Addressing these concerns, this paper attempts to propose a semi-automatic TRM composing method to incorporate multiple ST&I data sources—we design an extendable interface for engaging diverse ST&I data sources and apply the fuzzy set to transfer vague expert knowledge to defined numeric values for automatic TRM generation. We focus on a case study on computer science-related R&D. Empirical data from the United States (US) National Science Foundation (NSF) Award data (innovative research ideas and proposals) and Derwent Innovation Index (DII) patent data source (technical and commercial information) affords vantage points at two stages of R&D process and also provide further capabilities for more ST&I data source incorporation. The understanding gained will also assist in description of computer science macro-trends for R&D decision makers.",Zhang Y.; Chen H.; Zhu D.,Book Series,"Innovation, Technology and Knowledge Management",2016-01-01,University of Technology Sydney;Beijing Institute of Technology,Bibliometrics ;  Competitive technical intelligence ;  Fuzzy set ;  Technology roadmapping

Towards Innovation and Entrepreneurship,"In its efforts to leverage on research to promote and drive Innovation and Entrepreneurship in both public and private sectors, and in both MNCs and local enterprises, in order to achieve growth, Singapore is beginning to see some successes. Compared to its significant investments in research capability and capacity since the 1990s, the focus on commercialisation and new businesses has only been in the last 10 to 15 years. This can be seen, for example, from the establishment of the Action Community for Entrepreneurship, a public-private partnership to foster entrepreneurship, in 2003; and the renaming of the national “Science and Technology” Masterplan to the “Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE)"" plan to lend greater focus on innovation and enterprise. For local enterprises, this is a new game. It goes beyond RandD, into design-driven innovation, Open Innovation, Business Model Innovation, etc. The commercial successes of a few large local enterprises and the timely upgrading of high-growth SMEs through the GET-Up Programme of A*STAR and SPRING Singapore (as elaborated in Chapter 8) give hope that with further persistence and entrepreneurial skills, more Singapore SMEs will grow by launching more innovations in the near future. University and polytechnic education will need to be enhanced to provide training and hands-on experiences for engineering students to learn design-thinking, create viable business models, and develop awareness of technology commercialisation, techno-entrepreneurship, open innovation strategies, etc. Entrepreneurs like Sim Wong Hoo and Henn Tan are examples of these possibilities. There is evidence that with pro-active and substantial nurturing of talent and ideas more such entrepreneurs and companies can develop. Many more university and RI spin-off companies, fuelled by recently introduced POC/POV grants, nurtured through Incubation Centres or Accelerators, funded and assisted by a more sophisticated venture ecosystem, will generate a new momentum for innovation and entrepreneurship. New public policies to facilitate and accelerate this are being conceived and will be seen in the latest RIE2020 Plan announced in early 2016.",Seng L.; Thampuran R.; Hoe T.; Ong P.,Book,The Singapore Research Story,2016-01-01,"Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore;National University of Singapore;Nanyang Technological University;Accuron Technologies Ltd;Royal Academy of Engineers;National Research Foundation;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers",

Research on project financing modes of BOT and PPP based on case studies,"The scale and quantity of the domestic engineering construction increase continuously with the developing and good operation of the state economy. At the same time, the degree and scope of financing have constantly deepened. The executive meetings of the State Council in 2014 indicated that innovation mechanism of investment and financing should be promoted and PPP financing mode deserved to be widely replicated and expanded. PPP mode is confronting more opportunity of development in the construction industry. However, it is very easy to confuse PPP with BOT mode in the actual operating process. The paper will analysis the fact in respect of financing for the Laibin B project approved by the State Government implemented in China and Beijing Metro line 4 built in PPP mode. A comparison will be made separately between the two modes of financing for the concession projects and concluded the inter-relation and differences between the two modes by case studies.",Li X.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 International Conference on Logistics, Informatics and Service Sciences, LISS 2016",2016-01-01,Beijing Jiaotong University,BOT ;  Case studies ;  Financing mode ;  PPP ;  Variance analysis
Risk evaluation of technology innovation based on improved matter-element model,"Technology innovation is an important driven force for the economic development, the risk of which deserves attentions, and to evaluate risk accurately and effectively can be helpful to improve the success rate of technology innovation. As the risk of technology innovation is of strong uncertainty and fuzziness, the existing risk evaluation methods have certain limitations, while matter-element model can support these characteristics of problems. In this paper we improve the matter-element model, to construct indicator system of technology innovation risk, and determine the weight of indicators through a minimum deviation method integrating AHP weight and entropy weight, to evaluate the risk of technology innovation. Finally the calculation procedure and effectiveness of our method is illustrated via a case study.",Xiao Q.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 International Conference on Logistics, Informatics and Service Sciences, LISS 2016",2016-01-01,Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics,Entropy weight ;  Matter-element ;  Risk evaluation ;  Technology innovation
State of the Art on Functional Fabrication,"Digital fabrication technologies are becoming of importance to a number of knowledge areas and sectors, including medicine, entertainment, design, engineering, education, arts and architecture, due to their accessibility and versatility. These technologies are changing the design of digital models, materials and manufacturing processes which enable to build previously unachievable physical objects. Since many constraints imposed on the design of objects have changed significantly, a growing research community is working on graphical tools and techniques to enable the conception, automation, production and usage of innovative and complex designs for fabrication. In the present work, we survey the state of the art of computer graphics contributions to functional fabrication design tools and techniques. By functional fabrication we understand the design and manufacture of physical objects which functionalities exploit the capabilities of digital fabrication technologies. These functionalities include improving the mechanics of a workpiece, producing articulated models, capturing aerodynamics, planning deformable workpieces and controlling the object's appearance and acoustics. The resulting design tools are clearly taking advantage of relevant computer graphics techniques. Furthermore, they are extending these techniques to realise new physical forms as well as bringing innovation to feed into the design space.",Medeiros E Sá A.; Rodriguez-Echavarria K.; Pietroni N.; Cignoni P.,Conference Proceeding,GraDiFab 2016 - Eurographics Workshop on Graphics for Digital Fabrication,2016-01-01,Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche;University of Brighton;Fgv EMAp,
Product generation engineering efficient and effective to innovative drivetrain solutions,"Innovations are the result of transferring recognized customer value (product profile) into a new product (invention) and distributing and establishing that product in the market (diffusion) [Schumpeter 1934]. In opposite to the sometimes presented opinion stating that innovations are based on sudden inspirations, innovation is a hard and time-consuming work. In many cases an aha-moment occurs, but it arises from exhaustive dealing with the given task. Case studies show that the first product generation often lack the amount of maturity necessary to be thriving in the market. Hence products are often engineered further in subsequent product generations, which then lead to true success. The following chapters will first highlight product generation engineering and related research fields. Afterwards the main purpose of this paper is derived. To answer the research questions a long-term case study on the dual mass flywheel is presented and the approach of product generation engineering enhanced. Finally an outlook on current research topics is given. In this Plenary Lecture to the VDI Conference Drivetrain for Vehicles 2016 the theory of PGE is introduced by several selected industrial examples.",Albers A.; Ott S.; Bursac N.; Rapp S.,Book Series,VDI Berichte,2016-01-01,Karlsruher Institut für Technologie,
Green process system engineering,"One of the main tendencies of sustainable chemical engineering is to develop green technologies with the aim of eliminating pollution by preventing it in the first place, and thus, any breakthrough of single unit technology could make significant contributions to a new green technology. However, process engineering is a complex system which covers multiple units and sub-systems, including utilities, waste treatment and so on. Hence, besides single technology innovation, the whole chain covering raw material substitute, unit intensification and system should be highlighted during process development, and meanwhile considering the economic and environmental constraints. Also, along this chain, the novel materials/solvents and processes innovation are important for the process greening. On the base of the principles of system engineering and considering the research frontiers of the green process engineering, and taking new ionic liquids as key material, this article reviews the latest progresses in the aspects of raw material substitution, solvent innovation, transfer properties and process integration. The proposed viewpoints and methodology could become important bases to develop new green technologies, and also construct the science of green process system engineering subject.",Zhang S.; Zhang X.; Nie Y.; Bao D.; Dong H.; Lü X.,Journal,Huagong Xuebao/CIESC Journal,2016-01-01,Institute of Process Engineering Chinese Academy of Sciences,Green process system engineering ;  Green technology ;  Hydrogen-bond ;  Ionic liquid ;  Process systems ;  Simulation
Towards a requirements engineering process for innovative software: Learning with the conecteideias case,"For many years, Requirements Engineering has been regarded as a crucial phase of software development, because it is responsible to collect from the stakeholders and model the purposes of the system to be. Consequently, lots of research results have been accumulated over the years concerning approaches to elicit and model requirements. However, eliciting and modeling requirements for innovative software, for which no determined stakeholder is defined, are still open research issues. This is due to the very nature of innovation, which asks for new ways of thinking and generating software products. This paper aims at presenting the RE process which led to the development of a web-based social network named ConecteIdeias. This social network is aimed at supporting people on creating new ideas and solutions to change social reality in the place where they live. Besides briefly presenting the social network and thoroughly describing the process, this paper also presents some lessons learned and good practices gathered throughout the process execution.

Human-capital strategies to build world-class research universities in Asia: Impact on global flows,"As high-and middle-income countries attempt to gain an edge in the global knowledge economy, their governments have identified investments in higher education as a priority (Knight 2008; Li 2004; Marginson et al. 2011). In particular, research universities are seen as having significant positive impacts on the localities, regions, and countries in which they are situated, through the students they educate, the jobs they create, the knowledge they produce, the innovation they foster, and the prestige they bestow (Altbach et al. 2009; Jöns & Hoyler 2013; Li 2004; Mohrman et al. 2008; Mok 2005). In recent years, ambitious countries in East and Southeast Asia (e.g. China, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan) have invested vast sums to restructure their higher education sector and upgrade a select number of their national universities from largely teaching-oriented institutions to research-intensive ones with a focus on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (the STEM fields) (Li 2004; Sidhu et al. 2011; Zha 2009).",Paul A.; Long V.,Book,The Transnational Politics of Higher Education: Contesting the Global/Transforming the Local,2016-01-01,Yale-NUS College;National University of Singapore,

Design and anthropology: Anthropological studies of creativity and perception,"Design and Anthropology challenges conventional thinking regarding the nature of design and creativity, in a way that acknowledges the improvisatory skills and perceptual acuity of people. Combining theoretical investigations and documentation of practice based experiments, it addresses methodological questions concerning the re-conceptualisation of the relation between design and use from both theoretical and practice-based positions. Concerned with what it means to draw 'users' into processes of designing and producing this book emphasises the creativity of design and the emergence of objects in social situations and collaborative endeavours. Organised around the themes of perception and the user-producer, skilled practices of designing and using, and the relation between people and things, the book contains the latest work of researchers from academia and industry, to enhance our understanding of ethnographic practice and develop a research agenda for the emergent field of design anthropology. Drawing together work from anthropologists, philosophers, designers, engineers, scholars of innovation and theatre practitioners, Design and Anthropology will appeal to anthropologists and to those working in the fields of design and innovation, and the philosophy of technology and engineering.",Gunn W.; Donovan J.,Book,Design and Anthropology,2016-01-01,University of Aberdeen,
Engineering: The ultimate expression of creativity?,"Change of all types drives problem solving. In all but the most routine cases, the response to change requires solutions that are new and effective. Many of the solutions to change are technological in nature, drawing together engineering, design and creativity. It is surprising, therefore, that engineering design has not been more closely grounded in psychological creativity research. Engineering designers must think divergently, and are impacted by psychological factors of the person and the environment. Regrettably, there is still a disconnect between creativity research and the practice of engineering design. In an era of digitisation, creativity, and problem solving, are again rising in prominence in engineering design. If engineering is to realise its full potential, there are questions-already answered by the psychology of creativity-that must be addressed. Without this cross-fertilisation, engineering design-which should be the ultimate expression of creativity-will remain anchored in convergence and analysis.",Cropley D.,Book,The Curated Reference Collection in Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Psychology,2016-01-01,University of South Australia,Change ;  Convergent ;  Creativity ;  Design ;  Divergent ;  Effectiveness ;  Elegance ;  Environment ;  Genesis ;  Incremental ;  Innovation ;  Novelty ;  Person ;  Problem-solving ;  Process ;  Product
Reflection of literature on using lean innovation models for Start-Up ventures,"This paper discusses lean innovations and lean startup methods for the engineering management field. The aim of the literature review is to explain the methods and processes used in a lean startup. First, we discuss the concept of the startup and the impact that innovation has on startups and organizations seeking to implement lean innovations models. The assumption made in the hypothesis is that lean startup can be applied to areas outside of high-tech entrepreneurship. This hypothesis is further explored in the research. The findings in this paper suggest that innovation and entrepreneurship are highly influenced by innovation and company cultures. We find that technology transfer plays a key role in fostering innovation. However, there are barriers to public-private innovation partnerships, which are discussed in this paper.",Galli B.,Journal,Journal of Modern Project Management,2016-01-01,Hofstra University,Entrepreneurship ;  Lean innovations ;  Lean startup ;  Startup
Professional identity and teachers’ learning technology adoption: A review of adopter-related antecedents,"This paper reviews adopter-related antecedents of learning technology adoption by higher education teachers. We, drawing on findings from Management and Psychology, Computing, and Education, suggest an adopter-centered perspective on teachers’ learning technology adoption and identify work-related, technology-related, and teaching-related antecedents, which reflect aspects of teachers’ professional identity. We further argue that teachers’ professional identity shapes their perceptions of innovation characteristics, which in turn affects learning technology adoption. The paper concludes by highlighting that future research and practice should explore aspects of professional identity in order to more fully explain learning technology adoption, and should facilitate the adoption process through addressing the reconstruction of professional identity.",Liu Q.; Geertshuis S.,Conference Proceeding,"ASCILITE 2016 - Conference Proceedings - 33rd International Conference of Innovation, Practice and Research in the Use of Educational Technologies in Tertiary Education: Show Me the Learning",2016-01-01,The University of Auckland Business School,Antecedents ;  Learning technologies ;  Professional identity ;  Teacher ;  Technology adoption
Using enhanced nested function models for strategic product development,"TRIZ provides excellent tools for designing customized problemsolving and product developing processes and algorithms. Strategic decisions can furthermore be strengthened by tools still in development and under research, as the Trends of Engineering Systems Evolution and their underlying mechanisms. One of the difficulties when using TRIZ tools is the large number of possibilities for using and combining them for the best effect. Especially during the analysis phase, a lot of information has to be gathered that leads to problem models and task definition for later problem solving. To expand the usage of analytical tools for strategic decisions for long-term disruptive innovations or short-term incremental innovations, this chapter proposes a scientific approach that is based on the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving and its findings. The described procedure helps companies to find the right long- or short-term decisions: (a) They can check when their product might be eliminated from the market by following products and new settings and define indicators for long-term decisions, what the next products could be; (b) Similar to the forecast procedure the incremental way of further product development can also be checked and with this overview the development steps for the R&D, production, and sales departments can be better planned. The approach combines proven tools like Function Analysis with a new approach for modeling complex engineering systems (Nested Function Models), 9-Screen Models, S-Curve Analysis, and the Trends of Engineering System Evolution. This chapter examines the interactions between components on different system levels, the use of the model in conjunction with trimming, and the integration of the Multi-Screen Approach for developing a basis for strategic product development decisions. Furthermore, the possibilities of connecting Trends of Engineering Systems with this approach are explored. The suggested approach is aimed at creating an extensive, multilevel product map that combines the benefits of several classical TRIZ tools. It also creates a base for strategic decisions linked to problem-solving opportunities on the operative level.",Nähler H.; Gronauer B.,Book,"Research and Practice on the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ): Linking Creativity, Engineering and Innovation",2016-01-01,StrategieInnovation;C4pi-Center for Product-Innovation,9-screen model ;  Foresight ;  Function model ;  Strategic planning ;  Systematic innovation ;  Trends of engineering system evolution ;  TRIZ

Industry-Oriented Graduate Programs in Thailand: A Review,"In 2011, the World Bank upgraded Thailand’s income categorization from a middle-income economy to an upper-middle income one. Indeed, spanning half a century from the early 1950s, Thailand had been regarded as one of the most successful world economies, with annual GDP growth hovering close to 10 % in the early and mid-1990s. However, the recent performance of Thailand has been quite the opposite, with an 11-year average annual growth of only about 4 % dating from 1997. This decline, coupled with lower medium-term growth prospects, indicates fundamental problems with the country’s current state of development, raising the possibility that Thailand might now be falling into a “middle-income trap” (MIT) (Jitsuchon 2012). Some would even argue that Thailand has already been caught in a MIT for more than 20 years, as it has been unable to compete against advanced economies while also facing increasing competition from lower income economies (Phongpaichit and Benyaapikul 2012). The main cause of this is believed to be the continued dependence of Thailand on the “cheap labor” development model with a low level of technological innovation. One of the reasons for Thailand to be perpetuating this mode of development is that the Thai education system has been unable to equip graduates with relevant skills to meet the challenges of global competition, be they technical skills or soft skills such as thinking skills, communication skills, and leadership (Jitsuchon 2012). In engineering education in particular, the tightly structured and teacher-directed nature of education has been turning out graduates that generally lack strong analytical and problem-solving skills needed for the real world (Ziguras 2001; Ku et al. 2005). A low level of R&D activities and spending, which has been stagnated at 0.2 % of GDP for a number of years, is another hindrance for the country to advance to the next level of competition where more product and process innovation is needed (Jitsuchon 2012).",Fungtammasan B.,Book Series,International and Development Education,2016-01-01,King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi,Lower Income Economy ;  Practice School ;  Soft Skill ;  Thailand Research Fund ;  Thesis Study
Developing Research-Intensive Universities,"Whatever critics may think of global rankings, it is of some significance that Singapore’s two major universities, National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) both feature in the Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World Rankings in the top 40 universities in the world. Such rankings are based on research publication in benchmark peer-reviewed scientific journals, reputation among global academics, etc. It is a significant achievement for a small country that only started on the journey to research excellence with the establishment of the National Science and Technology Board (NSTB) in 1991, the same year as NTU’s establishment. Although other measures of excellence must also be taken into account, what they do indicate is the effectiveness of the national investment in education and research as part of the Singapore Government’s overall commitment to create a vibrant knowledge-based economy. Without such a commitment, building up research-intensive universities would not have been possible. In tandem with the mission-oriented RIs under NSTB/A*STAR, the universities play important roles in the RandD ecosystem. They came in for more attention as A*STAR and the National Research Foundation (NRF) started to spearhead thematic research programmes and fund the universities on emerging science and engineering topics and in areas with potential to become upstream resources for the RIs further downstream. Already an important part of the RandD landscape since the earliest days of any kind of interest in science and technology, the universities are today an even more important component of the RandD hub plan with the creation of the Research, Innovation and Enterprise Council (RIEC) and the NRF. When NRF started to look at emerging areas and embarking on this new strategy of funding new and strategic basic research, the universities came into focus. Unlike A*STAR, NRF is essentially a funding agency and does not manage any research institutes. NRF funds RandD projects that are expected to have longer-term national impact. Thus in 2006 one of the first NRF programmes was $500 million for water research, a sustainable and secure water supply being a continuing national issue, notwithstanding the success of NEWater, a PUB-initiated project in the late 1990s to look into recycling water. Another project in which NRF has invested funding is research into how dengue fever spreads. The National Environment Agency manages the project and turns to the universities and research institutes to learn more about ways to prevent and mitigate the spread of dengue, the diagnosis and treatment options, identification of virus types and distinguishing symptoms. The universities are in the thick of such research projects.",Halliwell B.; Andersson B.,Book,The Singapore Research Story,2016-01-01,National University of Singapore,
Challenges in the construction of the crystal houses façade,"This paper presents the main challenges confronted during the construction of the innovative Crystal Houses façade in Amsterdam. Designed by MVRDV and Gietermans & Van Dijk architectural offices, the façade is a transparent reproduction of the previous 19th century masonry elevation, entirely made of adhesively bonded solid glass bricks. Even the window and door frames are reinterpreted by elaborated massive cast glass components. To obtain pure transparency, the resulting 10 m by 12 m glass masonry wall should be self-supporting. To achieve the desired structural performance of the wall a colourless UV-curing adhesive of high stiffness is selected which reaches its optimum bond strength when applied in 0.3mm thick layer. The virtually zero thickness of the adhesive and the desire of untainted transparency induced various engineering challenges, from the adhesive’s homogeneous application and the dimensional accuracy of the bricks to the allowable tolerances in the entire façade. This paper records the challenges encountered and follows the innovations made from the manufacturing of the bricks to the final construction of the façade. The novel solutions include the manufacturing of glass elements of extreme dimensional precision, the development of methods for the accurate measuring and systematic levelling of the façade and the development of customized bonding techniques that lead to purely transparent and flawless connections. Based on the conclusions of the research and experience gained from the realization of the project, suggestions are made on the optimization of the developed system for its further applicability.",Oikonomopoulou F.; Bristogianni T.; Veer F.; Nijsse R.,Conference Proceeding,"Challenging Glass Conference Proceedings - Challenging Glass 5: Conference on Architectural and Structural Applications of Glass, CGC 2016",2016-01-01,Faculteit Bouwkunde van de TU Delft;Delft University of Technology,Adhesive glass connections ;  Glass Façade ;  Solid glass bricks ;  Structural glass

Developing an interactive computer program to enhance student learning of dynamical systems,"Today's students are quite accustomed to availing themselves of the latest in computer innovations and technology to aid in learning and the attainment of student outcomes. For example, use of tablets and cellphones in the classroom to take notes, collaborate on projects and to search the web for information is commonplace. Likewise, advancements in computer software and tools afford in-depth simulations of both mechanical and thermal systems. MATHEMATICA, with its symbolic and visual capabilities, is one such tool that, despite its robustness, is less utilized in classroom environments and is more integrated as a tool for those who pursue research in every discipline from economics to engineering. In this paper, the capabilities of MATHEMATICA are explored as a tool to model and visualize the forced mechanical response of viscoelastically-damped, multiple degree of freedom systems obtained through a Newtonian approach. Proportional damping facilitates the diagonalization of the resulting Eigen-value problem using a Cholesky Decomposition approach. In addition, multiple harmonics can be included as part of the forcing function. Displacement results for each mass permit the generation of graphical results and also provide the needed inputs for animated motions of all included masses. While the ultimate goal is to solve the dynamic response of general nth degree of freedom systems, explicit results are presented for the second, fourth, and tenth order degree of freedom systems to demonstrate the versatility of the software. The program utilized an interactive and user friendly interface developed in MATHEMATICA.",Howe D.; Barton O.,Journal,Computers in Education Journal,2016-01-01,College of Engineering and Computing,

Technology innovation risk identification based on sequential CBR,"To identify risks in the increasingly complex market is an important issue related to the survival and development of technology innovation enterprises. In front of diversified and massive risk sources, it is an inevitable choice for technology innovation enterprises to utilize IT to support the risk identification task. Case-Based Reasoning(CBR) is an analogical reasoning based AI method, and can help enterprises to identify new risks from past technology innovation risk cases, but have limitations for the problems with dynamic characteristics. Under this background, we study the sequential CBR method for technology innovation risk identification in the work, where cases are represented as risk event sequences and the case similarity measuring method based on weighted event sequence pattern mining is proposed.

Constructive Philosophy of Technology and Responsible Innovation,"This essay argues for a new turn after the empirical turn in the philosophy of technology: the societal turn, which is the turn from reflective philosophy of technology (academic philosophy concerned with analysis and understanding) to constructive philosophy of technology (philosophy that is directly involved in solving practical problems in society). The essay aims to describe in detail what a constructive approach would look like and how it could be achieved. It claims that at least in the European Union, the conditions for a constructive philosophy of technology are favorable, due to the emergence in both policy and academics of the notion of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI).

International inter-sectoral collaboration in university research centres: innovation systems in the United States and beyond in comparative perspective,"University research centres often involve a mix of inter-sectoral and international collaboration. Although the contributions of federally-funded research centres to the United States economy have been studied extensively, less is known about the international aspects of university research centres. The collaborations involved are influenced by opportunities and challenges arising from the national innovation systems of each partner organisation. The centres may also contribute to the innovation systems of the home countries of partners. In response, this article presents two case studies of United States university research centres engaged in international and inter-sectoral engineering research collaborations and the associated roles of the innovation systems of California and the United States more generally, involving France, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea. The case studies demonstrate the feasibility, and also the limitations, of using published accounts to understand the history, mission, and membership of such centres with international partners without government funding–leading to the identification of directions for future research on centres with international membership. The membership of the centres suggests that international collaborations may be a response to market and government failure in the public production of knowledge.",Miller J.,Journal,Asia Pacific Journal of Public Administration,2016-01-01,University of Southern California,France ;  Hong Kong ;  innovation systems ;  inter-sectoral collaboration ;  international collaboration ;  Singapore ;  South Korea ;  United States ;  university research centres
Optimization and characterization of the synthetic secondary chromosome synVicII in Escherichia coli,"Learning by building is one of the core ideas of synthetic biology research. Consequently, building synthetic chromosomes is the way to fully understand chromosome characteristics. The last years have seen exciting synthetic chromosome studies. We had previously introduced the synthetic secondary chromosome synVicII in Escherichia coli. It is based on the replication mechanism of the secondary chromosome in Vibrio cholerae. Here, we present a detailed analysis of its genetic characteristics and a selection approach to optimize replicon stability. We probe the origin diversity of secondary chromosomes from Vibrionaceae by construction of several new respective replicons. Finally, we present a synVicII version 2.0 with several innovations including its full compatibility with the popular modular cloning (MoClo) assembly system.",Messerschmidt S.; Schindler D.; Zumkeller C.; Kemter F.; Schallopp N.; Waldminghaus T.,Journal,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,2016-01-01,Philipps-Universität Marburg,Bacteria ;  Chromosome biology ;  Directed evolution ;  Genetic engineering ;  Replicon integrity ;  Synthetic chromosomes ;  Synthetic genomes ;  Vibrio cholerae
The innovation pivot framework: Fostering business model innovation in startups,"OVERVIEW: Business model design is critical for a startup. A successful design must be developed and tested with limited resources and under conditions of great uncertainty related to both internal and external factors. At the same time, this lack of definition is an excellent opportunity for business model innovation. In this paper, we present the Innovation Pivot Framework, a practical tool aimed at assisting entrepreneurs in identifying alternative uses of their innovation and deciding which applications and target markets they should pursue first. This process leads to a formulation of the source of competitive advantage based on the innovation envisioned. This tool may be useful both at the first moment of a startup’s conceptualization and when the new venture needs to redefine its competitive advantage. Beyond the area of entrepreneurship, it could also be an effective analysis tool to achieve better business model designs in well-established companies.",García-Gutiérrez I.; Martínez-Borreguero F.,Journal,Research Technology Management,2016-01-01,Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,Business model design ;  Business model innovation ;  Entrepreneurship

Innovative approach to the new technological developments,"The article is devoted to the experience in use of a fairly new organizational and methodological approach to working out and implementing engineering developments in practice of an enterprise, and to a way for accomplishing productive R&D despite of quite restricted resources available. When prospective R&D plans for OMZ-Foundry Manufacture Ltd. were developed, some contradictions were identified between the common practically used approaches to how R&D are conducted on one hand, and the modern demands and expectations to the resulted solutions on the other hand. The standard system of how current R&D are actually conducted often hinders organizations from using their potential in full scale. Restrictions and limitations of different nature, stipulated by lack of funds, laboratory equipment deficiency, high workloads of staff, extra administrative load associated with any unplanned action, etc., impede obtaining the best results. For these and other reasons, screening of different opportunities was done to seek ways for how to intensify innovations overtaking the mentioned restrictions, that the actual reality conditions impose. Finally, one comparatively rarely used approach was taken: use of consulting service enforcing the professional staff activity in different ways at once. Within day-to-day work in progress, an experiment was carried out for implementation of organizational and methodological innovations in interior R&D, with due regard to the actual manufacture process, and in real time mode. The approach all-inclusively combines professional knowledge and skills of the staff, specific professional multipurpose research in patent information, experience in counselling for solving technical problems, and enhancing creativity of the staff. The approach is targeted to intensification of the interior innovative process, phase-out of imports process, and enhancing quality of final achievements. The approach demonstrated its efficiency in R&D intensification at manufacturing process, and organizational and methodological innovative efficiency; and besides versatile progressive experience was obtained. The economic efficiency in actual production process is considered not less than well-known approaches, when for example staff is taught in TRIZ first, and with the following efforts in working out, proving and implementing results of training in the actual production process.",Akselrod B.; Chumakov V.,Journal,Chernye Metally,2016-01-01,OMZ-Foundry Manufacture Ltd.;Mekhanobr-Analyt Co.,Concept generation ;  Imports phase-out ;  Innovative technologies ;  Intellectual property ;  Invention environment ;  New developments ;  Organizational innovations ;  Patent researches ;  Problem solving ;  R&D; triz
Research on the Risks of International High-Speed Railway Projects Based on the FIDIC-EPC Total Price Contract,"Nowadays, Chinese high-speed railway companies have already developed the core technology of independent research and innovation of high-speed railway. However, domestic enterprises participating in the competition of international high-speed railway projects will encounter a variety of risks. Under the conditions of contract for FIDIC-EPC, the equilibrium allocation of mechanism is broken. Contractors take a lot of additional risks in the case of the higher contract's price paid by owners. Generally, the international high-speed railway projects use the FIDIC-EPC contract. Based on the angle of contractors, this paper has studied the main risks of high-speed railway projects on the basis of risk analysis. The countermeasures are put forward to deal with market risks, technical risks, exchange rate risks, implement-contract risks, and human resource risks for contractors. Moreover, building information modeling (BIM) system of integrated management of high-speed railway projects is put forward to strengthen the control for general contractors in order to reduce the losses of risks.",Ma G.; Luo H.; Zheng J.,Conference Proceeding,ICCREM 2016: BIM Application and Offsite Construction - Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Construction and Real Estate Management,2016-01-01,Shanghai University,

Robotics competitions and challenges,"This chapter explores the use of competitions to accelerate robotics research and promote science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. We argue that the field of robotics is particularly well suited to innovation through competitions. Two broad categories of robot competition are used to frame the discussion: human-inspired competitions and task-based challenges. Human-inspired robot competitions, of which the majority are sports contests, quickly move through platform development to focus on problem solving and test through game play. Task-based challenges attempt to attract participants by presenting a high aim for a robotic system. The contest can then be tuned, as required, to maintain motivation and ensure that the progress is made. Three case studies of robot competitions are presented, namely robot soccer, the UAV challenge, and the DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) grand challenges. The case studies serve to explore from the point of view of organizers and participants, the benefits and limitations of competitions, and what makes a good robot competition. This chapter ends with some concluding remarks on the natural convergence of human-inspired competitions and task-based challenges in the promotion of STEM education, research, and vocations.",Nardi D.; Roberts J.; Veloso M.; Fletcher L.,Book,Springer Handbook of Robotics,2016-01-01,School of Computer Science;Sapienza Università di Roma;Queensland University of Technology;Boeing Research and Technology Australia,Autonomous vehicle ;  Defense advance research project agency ;  Grand challenge ;  Humanoid robot ;  Unmanned aircraft
Imported entrepreneurs: Foreign-born scientists and engineers in U.S. stem fields entrepreneurship,"The STEM fields-science, technology, engineering and mathematics-are the source of tangible innovations in products and processes that help to spur economic growth. Though many of these advances may occur in established organizations, radical innovation has long been associated with entrepreneurial ventures. Several previous studies have shown that high-growth, high-tech STEM-based businesses in the United States are disproportionately founded by foreign-born scientists and engineers. However, recent data also suggest that immigrants' rate of participation in U.S. entrepreneurship is slowing. Policies that support nascent immigrant STEM entrepreneurs may also help to improve U.S. employment rates, economic productivity, and career satisfaction among new Americans and legal permanent residents. This report investigates several explanations for differences in STEM entrepreneurship between college-educated native-born and foreign-born workers. It also explores reasons for differences in entrepreneurial participation among foreign-born workers. These reasons may include: • Immigration status and visa eligibility, • Age of arrival in the U.S. (as a child versus as an adult), • Graduating from a U.S. or foreign institution of higher learning, and • Differences in cultural support for entrepreneurship across countriesof-origin. We also describe differences in aspects of job satisfaction by citizenship and immigration status, providing insight into the preferences and work experiences of high-skilled foreign-born workers in the U.S. labor force. Although we cannot identify with certainty the causes of recent observed declines in U.S. entrepreneurial participation among the foreign-born, our empirical results do suggest opportunities for policy and further research to help spur greater participation in the future.",Blume-Kohout M.,Book,Foreign-Born STEM Entrepreneurship: Participation and Differences with U.S.-Born Workers,2016-01-01,,
Partial order concepts in applied sciences,"This book illustrates recent advances in applications of partial order theory and Hasse diagram techniques to data analysis, mainly in the socio-economic and environmental sciences. For years, partial order theory has been considered a fundamental branch of mathematics of only theoretical interest. In recent years, its effectiveness as a tool for data analysis is increasingly being realized and many applications of partially ordered sets to real problems in statistics and applied sciences have appeared. Main examples pertain to the analysis of complex and multidimensional systems of ordinal data and to problems of multi-criteria decision making, so relevant in social and environmental sciences. Partial Order Concepts in Applied Sciences presents new theoretical and methodological developments in partial order for data analysis, together with a wide range of applications to different topics: multidimensional poverty, economic development, inequality measurement, ecology and pollution, and biology, to mention a few. The book is of interest for applied mathematicians, statisticians, social scientists, environmental scientists and all those aiming at keeping pace with innovation in this interesting, growing and promising research field.",Fattore M.; Bruggemann R.,Book,Partial Order Concepts in Applied Sciences,2016-01-01,Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries;Università degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca,
Identifying tensions in the servitized value chain,"OVERVIEW: Servitization is recognized as an opportunity for manufacturing firms to harvest additional value by accessing new sources of revenue and expanding their reach up and down the value chain. It is a network activity, as it involves not just the servitizing firm but actors across the firm’s ecosystem. Most studies argue that servitization creates value for all network actors. However, service innovation activities may also result in the firm appropriating value from other actors, creating tensions in the network. Those tensions can undermine servitization efforts and destroy value for all participants. To avoid this outcome, firms must anticipate and manage tensions to create cooperative relationships with value chain partners. Through a series of semi-structured interviews with key actors at servitizing firms and their customers and intermediaries, we identified specific types and sources of tensions in the servitization process and explored how they might be mitigated or managed.",Jamie J.; Story V.; Zolkiewski J.; Raddats C.; Baines T.; Medway D.,Journal,Research Technology Management,2016-01-01,Alliance Manchester Business School;Manchester Metropolitan University;University of Liverpool;Aston University;Loughborough University,Business model innovation ;  Service innovation ;  Servitization ;  Value chain
Development of analytical thinking ability and attitudes towards science learning of grade-11 students through science technology engineering and mathematics (STEM education) in the study of stoichiometry,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the analytical thinking abilities and attitudes towards science learning of grade-11 students through science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education integrated with a problem-based learning in the study of stoichiometry. The research tools consisted of a pre- and post-analytical thinking ability test, a science learning attitude test, classroom observations, student reflective journals, and semi-structured interviews. The findings indicated that STEM learning activities based on problem-based learning successfully developed analytical thinking abilities and attitudes towards science learning. Consequently, the students realized how important theories are, and were able to integrate their knowledge from various fields to solve problems and to create new innovations. About 80% of the students showed higher analytical thinking ability scores above the prescribed criterion of 70% of the full score. After learning, the scores of the students were higher than those before learning at a confidence level of 0.01. The attitudes towards science learning were higher than those before learning at a confidence level of 0.01. The successful activities of STEM started with offering knowledge to students through an inquiry-based process until they could construct the knowledge on their own. After that, the teacher initiated a problem situation and allowed each group of students to create a useful product adopted from the experimental results via integrating STEM knowledge to modify their creative works.",Chonkaew P.; Sukhummek B.; Faikhamta C.,Journal,Chemistry Education Research and Practice,2016-01-01,Kasetsart University;King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi,

STEAM: Education and communication with Art at ATLAS and CMS,"Recent developments in science education policy and practice suggest that successful learning in the 21st century requires the horizontal connectedness across areas of knowledge by linking the arts and humanities with science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects. The rapidly increasing STEAM movement calls for arts integration into science teaching and learning to help school students develop skills that are necessary to thrive in an innovation economy. Education and outreach in highenergy physics are not an exception to these developments.

Creativity and stem education: Paradox or praxis?,"Although most people think of the arts when they think of creativity, it is clear that creativity in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields is a key to innovation and economic prosperity. Yet, creativity is rarely addressed in STEM education, and few teachers are prepared to incorporate creative thinking activities into their STEM classes. Even STEAM, which adds the arts into the collection of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, does not necessarily add creativity into the STEM areas themselves. Yet, individuals who are going to make a difference in a field must be able to think creatively and innovate, not just consume knowledge. We see several areas wherein creativity is a natural part of STEM content, process, and dispositions. For example, instruction in spatial skills, which are associated with achievement in mathematics as well as science, engineering, and technology, can boost both creativity and STEM achievement. Also, exploration of the role of the STEM studies in art and vice versa is another way to incorporate creative processes into instruction. Finally, the very important role of creative thinking dispositions, such as persistence in problem solving, is central to both creativity and STEM research. In this chapter, we examine how to emphasize creativity in STEM, and STEAM, and discuss how it can impact students’ interest and achievement.",Cramond B.; Gerow K.,Book,Creativity in Gifted Children,2016-01-01,University of Georgia;Founder Double Helix Steam School,

Innovation and knowledge intensive business service firms: Hong Kong’s engineering consulting sector,"The purpose of this book is to investigate the innovation process in engineering consulting firms as a knowledge-intensive service sector. Extant literature in the resource-based view of the firm calls for empirical studies to illustrate the process of how human resource systems provide organizations with a competitive advantage. The key issue is on how the different elements of human resource systems interact. The evidence unveiled in this book does just that. Likewise, it has been suggested that resource systems as a source of a competitive edge should not be viewed as a static phenomenon. Sustained competitiveness requires an organization to constantly adjust itself according to the evolving market conditions. Such dynamic capability has been illustrated in cases within this book. On the other hand, literature on innovation studies indicates that new analytical approaches applicable to both manufacturing and service industries can be beneficial to future research in this field. The tactic adopted in this book can serve as a prelude to such an attempt.",Ma K.,Book,Innovation and Knowledge-Intensive Business Service Firms: Hong Kong's Engineering Consulting Sector,2016-01-01,The Education University of Hong Kong,

Implementing computer numerical controls affordably at a four year University,"Additive manufacturing, fundamentally, is computerized numerical controls using a specialized printer head as the ""tool"". Any new curriculum implementing ""additive manufacturing"" stands upon the fundamental and advanced work done before in computer numerical controls. Although there certainly is a need for end user laboratories based upon purchased printers, the challenge in designing curriculums that support developing the next generation of additive manufacturing must also include computer numerical controls. The best designers must be able to picture the entire system when developing new systems. During the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, the ""hands-on"" engineering laboratories typical of the post-World War II engineering campus gave way to computerized laboratories and simulation. Traditional engineering assets (lathes, mills, drill presses, etc.) were retired as they aged without replacement in favor of computer laboratories full of PC's and software. As the 20th century ended, there was a realization that computer simulation is no substitute for ""cutting metal"" or ""making things"". Designers need to understand process in order to communicate with technologists from trade schools and industry. Even a simple engineering drawing can often simply not be created due to process limitations (e.g., a perfectly drawn internal 90-degree angle in a CAD drawing does not occur in nature OR a machine shop). As the four year universities shut down their hands on programs, the two year programs implemented complex computer numerical controls curriculums to train operators for industry. The incredibly expensive equipment needed to do this is funded by state governments trying to attract industry to the state. The four year universities, responsible for creating the next generation of manufacturing machines, do not have access to THIS generations machines. The National Science Foundation and state governments don't see the need for upper level engineering students to have ready access to machines that cost up to a million dollars each. The universities fortunate to have CNC machines usually keep them locked away from the students for safety of the machines and the students. Technicians make things for the students on the limited number or machines available. There is no understanding of the machines and very little understanding of the processes the machines are doing. An earlier paper by the authors described a way to implement an affordable undergraduate ""manual"" innovation laboratory. This article describes an affordable way for upper level universities to implement an effective machine design atmosphere for subtractive and additive manufacturing. The students modify existing machines from that earlier laboratory into multi-axis CNC machines. Students have successfully built five axis mills, lathes with live tooling and now a unique metal printing machine. The goal is not to create operators, but to enable designers of the next generation of machines. At the very least, students are immediately useful as design engineers when hired by companies making the most advanced (and expensive) additive/subtractive machines. The emphasis is not on expensive super machines but on very capable simple machines as emphasized in the Toyota Production System. One specific, inexpensive example will be provided for other institutions to utilize. The result has been an affordable laboratory that supports undergraduate students, graduate research students, and the university as a whole while teaching the design and control of computer numerical machines.",Hunko W.; Payton L.,Conference Proceeding,"ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, Proceedings (IMECE)",2016-01-01,Auburn University,CNC Conversion ;  Computer Numerical Control (CNC) ;  Milling
Overview of the oak ridge national laboratory advanced manufacturing integrated energy demonstration project: Case study of additive manufacturing as a tool to enable rapid innovation in integrated energy systems,"Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Additive Manufacturing Integrated Energy (AMIE) demonstration project leverages rapid innovation through additive manufacturing to connect a natural-gas-powered hybrid electric vehicle to a highperformance building designed to produce, consume and store renewable energy. The AMIE demonstration project consists of a building and vehicle that were additively manufactured (3D-printed) using the laboratory's big area additive manufacturing (BAAM) capabilities and an integrated energy system with smart controls that connects the two via wireless power transfer. The printed utility vehicle features a hybrid electric powertrain with onboard power generation from a natural gas fueled auxiliary power unit (APU). The APU extends vehicle range through a series hybrid powertrain configuration that recharges the vehicle's lithium-ion energy storage system and acts as a mobile power generation system for the printed building. The development of the powertrain used for the printed range-extended electric vehicle was completed using a powertrain-in-the-loop development process and the vehicle prototype implementation was accelerated using BAAM. A flexible 3.2 kW solar photovoltaic system paired with electric vehicle batteries will provide renewable power generation and storage. Energy flows back and forth between the car and house using fast, efficient bidirectional wireless power transfer. The AMIE project marked the first demonstration of bidirectional level 2 charging through wireless power transfer. The accelerated creation and printing of the car and house will further demonstrate the program's function as an applied science tool to get products to market more quickly than what currently is possible with traditional manufacturing. This paper presents a case study that summarizes the efforts and technical details for using the printed research platforms. This paper explores the focuses on printing of the vehicle, powertrain integration, and possibilities for vehicles providing power to buildings in different scenarios. The ability for BAAM to accelerate the prototype development for the integrated energy system process is explored. Details of how this was successfully accomplished in 9 months with more than 20 industry partners are discussed.",Jackson R.; Curran S.; Chambon P.; Post B.; Love L.; Wagner R.; Ozpineci B.; Chinthavali M.; Starke M.; Green J.; Tryggestad L.; Lee B.,Conference Proceeding,"ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, Proceedings (IMECE)",2016-01-01,Oak Ridge National Laboratory;Skidmore,
"Qualitative research in STEM: Studies of equity, access, and innovation","Qualitative Research in STEM examines the groundbreaking potential of qualitative research methods to address issues of social justice, equity, and sustainability in STEM. A collection of empirical studies conducted by prominent STEM researchers, this book examines the experiences and challenges faced by traditionally marginalized groups in STEM, most notably culturally and linguistically diverse students and women. Investigations into these issues, as well as the high dropout rate among engineering students and issues of academic integrity in STEM, come with detailed explanations of the study methodologies used in each case. Contributors also provide personal narratives that share their perspectives on the benefits of qualitative research methodologies for the topics explored.

Thermal Treatment of Hydrocarbon-Impacted Soils: A Review of Technology Innovation for Sustainable Remediation,"Thermal treatment technologies hold an important niche in the remediation of hydrocarbon-contaminated soils and sediments due to their ability to quickly and reliably meet cleanup standards. However, sustained high temperature can be energy intensive and can damage soil properties. Despite the broad applicability and prevalence of thermal remediation, little work has been done to improve the environmental compatibility and sustainability of these technologies. We review several common thermal treatment technologies for hydrocarbon-contaminated soils, assess their potential environmental impacts, and propose frameworks for sustainable and low-impact deployment based on a holistic consideration of energy and water requirements, ecosystem ecology, and soil science. There is no universally appropriate thermal treatment technology. Rather, the appropriate choice depends on the contamination scenario (including the type of hydrocarbons present) and on site-specific considerations such as soil properties, water availability, and the heat sensitivity of contaminated soils. Overall, the convergence of treatment process engineering with soil science, ecosystem ecology, and plant biology research is essential to fill critical knowledge gaps and improve both the removal efficiency and sustainability of thermal technologies.",Vidonish J.; Zygourakis K.; Masiello C.; Sabadell G.; Alvarez P.,Journal,Engineering,2016-01-01,George R.

Emerging treatments for intervertebral disc disease,"Degenerative disc disease (DDD) is a significant component of spine disorders and low back pain, and the prevalence of disc disease is increasing with an aging population. While current treatment modalities, ranging from conservative approaches to surgical interventions, are continually evolving, new therapies for intervertebral disc disease are also in development. Increased research on the cellular mechanisms underlying DDD have led to novel cell-based treatments which aim to delay rates of degeneration [1, 3]. Most of these cellular therapies remain in the research phase. Recent innovations in engineering have also pioneered several types of surgical constructs that improve the durability of treatment, while minimizing device-associated complications. Several examples include hybrid materials for intervertebral cages, zero-profile implants, expandable cages, sagittal correction implants, and disc arthroplasty. Finally, surgical techniques have been refined and adapted to allow less invasive modalities such as endoscopic and percutaneous techniques to reach adequate treatment effect with less risk of adverse event and further degeneration of the incident and adjacent spinal segments. This chapter highlights several emerging non-surgical and surgical treatments for intervertebral disc disease.",Arnone G.; Rangwala S.; Mehta A.,Book,"Intervertebral Disc Degeneration: Prevalence, Risk Factors and Treatments",2016-01-01,University of Illinois at Chicago,Degenerative disc disease ;  Emerging therapy ;  Intervertebral disc disease ;  Nonsurgical treatment ;  Surgical treatment ;  Treatment
ArchaeoBIM: From excavation to building information modeling of a buried structure. The case of the Tuscanic Temple of Uni in Marzabotto,"The model of the Tuscanic Temple of Uni in Marzabotto, recently discovered, has been a common ground for engineering and archaeological studies, thanks to the processing of a Building Information Modeling (BIM). Beside the historic and archaeological analysis, the innovation of this study concerns the examination of the Etruscan temple as a three-dimensional building, with the use of technologies which impact on the architectural reliability of the model, and the design of a new method of Experimental Archaeology based on a virtual approach. The uniqueness of this approach lies in the study of original elements at the starting point of the building process, that consist in foundations or spoliated structures (i.e. negative evidences), over the clues from the historical and scientific literature. To better define this distinctive working process, the expression ArchaeoBIM has been proposed. With this expression we underline the common BIM matrix in the data management through integrated analytical models, applied to a particular aspect of the archaeological research.",Garagnani S.; Gaucci A.; Govi E.,Journal,Archeologia e Calcolatori,2016-01-01,Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna,

Why don't they join? Analyzing the nature and consequences of complementors' costs in platform ecosystems,"Platforms enable third-parties to develop new software artefacts like applications and become the locus of digital innovation. Prior studies have mainly focused on the benefits that initially motivate external complementors to join an ecosystem. However, little is known about the costs that are associated with this choice and how such costs actually influence the decision to interrelate with a platform owner. We develop the overarching idea that the complementor's costs are mainly influenced by the interplay of the microarchitecture of single extensions and control modes applied to govern the ecosystem. The purpose of our research is therefore to shed light on the nature of complementors' costs on the micro-level of transactions between the platform owner and the complementor and their effects on the intention to join an ecosystem. Using data from a quantitative survey among complementors of five leading platforms in the Enterprise Application Software industry hypothesized relationships are tested.",Dellermann D.; Jud C.; Popp K.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2016",2016-01-01,SAP SE;Universität Kassel;Universität Stuttgart,IS control ;  Modularity ;  Platform ecosystem ;  Software platform ;  Transaction cost economics
Reconstructing open source software ecosystems: Finding structure in digital traces,"We report on the computational reconstruction of 273 open source software ecosystems, consisting of 41,388 artifacts and couplings between them, extracted from digital traces of 34.4 million software artifacts. We argue that digital traces are a new kind of data source, and propose 'exploratory data loops' to exploit the benefits of digital trace data in early stages of a research program. We apply this schema to systematically assess data quality, inform sample selection, and detect patterns. Empirically, we show that highly distributed networks are unlikely to follow a hierarchically modular structure, despite popular belief. As is shown visually with two examples, very distinct structures can emerge from autonomous behavior. The results indicate that different, yet similarly effective, strategies may exist to organize for distributed innovation in digital ecosystems. The paper is concluded by outlining how follow-up work will harness the reconstructed ecosystems for detecting behavioral patterns in distributed networks.",Eck A.; Uebernickel F.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2016",2016-01-01,University of St. Gallen,Computational social science ;  Data-driven research ;  Digital ecosystems ;  Digital trace data ;  Doubly distributed networks ;  Open source software
Governing the commons from communities to markets,"Open source software is central to the argument of inclusion of community-based production as a new form of organizing for growth and innovation. However, whether the same can be applied by embedding the market-based production in the solidarity and social-trust based systems remains theoretically unclear and largely unexplored empirically. Building on prior research on governing the commons, we revise the theoretical framing of exclusion and subtractability to underline their inverse and reciprocal relationship. We examine the genealogy of community-based production from communities to markets and further use two contemporary cases to illustrate 1) how exclusion leads to underuse and underinvestment from the business investor's perspective, 2) how subractability facilitates business investment without crowding out nonprofit contributors, and 3) how actors self-organize to address the social and business dilemma, ensuring that both community and market-based production can more effectively adapt, innovate and survive in the long term.",Kuk G.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2016",2016-01-01,Nottingham Business School,Common pool resources ;  Difficulty of exclusion ;  Software commons ;  Subtractability

Jet aircraft non-volatile particulate matter characterization and estimation,"Jet engine aircraft exhaust contains combustion byproducts and particulate matter in the form of nonvolatile particulate matter (nvPM), black carbon (BC) is used synonymously for nvPM throughout this paper. Aircraft cruise emissions are the only direct source of anthropogenic BC particles at altitudes above the tropopause.1 Black carbon aerosols are strong solar radiation absorbers and have long atmospheric lifetimes.2 Therefore, BC results in positive radiative forcing and is believed to be the second largest contributor to climate change.3 Additionally, upper troposphere and lower stratosphere BC particles contribute to climate forcing indirectly by acting as ice nucleation sites and cloud activators.4-6 With regards to human health, a link between cardiopulmonary diseases and carbonaceous black particulate matter has recently been suggested.7 As concern for human health risks and environmental impacts caused by aviation BC emissions increases, emission reduction strategies will need to be implemented. An ambitious carbon, solid and gaseous, emission reduction goal of 50% reduction by 2050 as compared to 2000-2005 levels have already been defined by the International Air Transport Association and Advisory Council for Aviation Research and Innovation in Europe.8 Meeting these goals will require significant engineering advancements requiring a long implementation period. However, in the near term, alternative jet fuels with reduced aromatic content are an attractive solution for reducing BC emission.9-12 Alternative aviation fuels containing synthetic blend components with near zero aromatic content (synthetic paraffinic kerosenes, SPKs) such as those synthesized via the Fischer-Tropsch (FT-SPK) process and hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA-SPK) overall contain highly reduced aromatic content compared to conventional fuel and thus significantly reduce aircraft engine BC emissions.9-12.",Vander Wal R.; Abrahamson J.,Conference Proceeding,Environmental Division 2016 - Core Programming Area at the 2016 AIChE Annual Meeting,2016-01-01,,
Advanced technologies to enable simulation of life-cycle sustainment of weapon systems,"The authors have witnessed and been part of the development of the burgeoning complexities of weapons systems. They have focused some of their research on the need to analyze the life-cycle sustainment of these systems. This sustainment analysis has similarly grown in complexity and sophistication. To be optimally useful, the results and insights from these analyses need to be accessible long before the systems are fielded and before sustainment parame-ters can be established and sustainment data collected from live implementations. This strongly supports the need to employ both constructive and virtual simulations to provide pre-deployment ""experience"" with systems. These simula-tions must be programmed to include the various input and output parameters of the system-engineered sustainment model. The size of modern weapons systems and the wide geographical dispersion of such systems calls for significant computational capabilities; this need is exacerbated by the current focus on simulating operations in large urban areas, fully populated by red, blue and civilian populations, all suitably programmed to act in a demographically appropriate way. Because a major factor of sustainment is maintenance and that maintenance is dramatically impacted by environ-mental factors, the modeling of these factors, along with verifiable functions representing their impact on hardware and personnel, must be modeled as well. There is a long history of using high performance computing to enable and en-hance large-scale simulations and some of the authors have been part of that development process since 1995. Further, new advances in computing now offer to create a new computational paradigm for high performance computing, e.g., the innovations at the University of Southern California, Quantum Computing Center. As Systems Engineering has co-evolved with these computational advances, it has made good use of Markov and martingale analyses, and one of the authors is currently developing a model that relies on this sub-discipline of analysis to better characterize the sustain-ment of weapons systems. Serendipitously, this line of inquiry is well situated to make excellent use of the quantum annealer at USC, as Markov processes are the foundation of the annealer's operations, This paper will briefly de-scribe the need for and the current state of the art of sustainment analyses, lay out the need for improved and expanded simulation techniques, and discuss the path to facilitating the implementation these across the entire spectrum of the simulation community. Alternative approaches, interoperability challenges, and future developments will be suggested, outlined and documented.",Burns D.; Petersen L.; Davis D.; Yao K.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 Simulation Innovation Workshop, SIW 2016",2016-01-01,"University of Southern California;Office of Naval Research;Information Sciences Institute;Home Port Solutions, LLC",Life-cycle sustainment ;  Markov analysis ;  Martingale analysis ;  Quantum Computing ;  Systems Engineering
Innovation in infrastructure projects: An Australian perspective,"Purpose - Unlike manufacturing and research and developments, major infrastructure projects rarely emphasize or drive their objectives on the basis of innovation. This is in part because of a risk-Averse culture, yet conceivably great benefits and opportunities are being lost because of this behavior. Design/methodology/approach -The case for focusing on innovation in infrastructure projects is that the reasons driving innovation are not fully understood, and this impedes the effective implementation of lessons learned for the numerous innovative projects into practice more generally. The purpose of this study was to discover how innovation is produced and captured in major infrastructure projects in Australia and to understand how innovation may be replicated for future projects through refinement of design, project management, finance and procurement. Findings - Engineering and project managers may find this paper helpful to better understand how innovation might happen in infrastructure projects and what different forms it can take. Originality/value -The findings of this study demonstrate that people and culture drive consistent successful infrastructure outcomes more than simply the development of new products or processes.",Maghsoudi S.; Duffield C.; Wilson D.,Journal,International Journal of Innovation Science,2016-01-01,University of Melbourne,Innovation
Developing a system for sustainable product design and manufacture,"Research studies confirm that embracing sustainability in product design and manufacturing not only yields environmental improvements, but offers key business benefits. There is an increasing pressure to adopt a more sustainable approach to product design and manufacture. Organizations that are actively engaged in sustainable product design and development cite impressive levels of improvement over their poorer performing peers in product innovation, quality, safety and revenue growth alongside anticipated environmental and energy gains. Sustainability in design and manufacturing has a lot to do with ""doing better with less,"" and embracing a broader view of product development, and examining full lifecycle of the product and the impact that its design, manufacture, performance and disposal can have across not only on business, but on the environment and society, as well. The process of rethinking a product's design so that it is more durable contains fewer parts and easily packaged and recycled also drives innovation and quality. The goal of sustainable product design (SPD) is to produce products and/or to provide services, which are sustainable and achieve their required functionality, meet customer requirements and are cost effective. In other words, SPD is about producing superior products and/or services that fulfil traditional criteria as well as sustainability requirements. The requirement to develop sustainable product is one of the key challenges of 21st century This paper describes a system that identifies sustainability related performance measures for products in terms of: a) Sustainable product design by robust design b) Sustainable design by quality of service. The first case study is on a laser based measuring instrument which supports the theory of sustainable product by robust design techniques The objective of the robust design study is to find the optimum recommended factor setting for the surface roughness analyser to minimize the variability in the readings. This instrument relies on the spread of the laser light on the work piece to determine surface roughness; therefore, the analyser's reliability depends primarily on everything involved with the laser and its path. There are a minimum number of parts to achieve this function since the laser can scan over the work piece, substituting functionality in place of additional parts. The use of surface roughness analyser for online measurement of surface finish and continuous online monitoring and control with a feedback provides the robustness in quality and sustainability. The second case study, which is on elevator quality of service, is considered to support the theory of sustainable design by quality of service. This example shows how the design considerations are influenced and closely linked to the quality of service and maintenance. To support the theory of sustainability by quality of service, this case study examines elevator design and maintenance and recommends a new procedure based on Root Couse Analysis resulting in Elevator Condition Index (ECI). ECI is a new procedure and is applied based on original equipment reliability, projected average life cycle of key wear components, number of run cycles since maintenance was last performed on each component, cost of emergency repair vs. cost of maintenance vs. likelihood of failure. It supports service based on prognostics rather than routine service cycles. Sustainable design and manufacturing is possible if we deploy the virtual engineering tools to monitor and service manufacturing machinery so that the sustainable benefits are maintained throughout the product design cycle. The choice of a workplace structure depends on the design of the parts and lot sizes to be manufactured as well as market factors, such as the responsiveness to changes. Designers should be aware of the manufacturing consequences of their decisions because minor design changes during the early stages often prevent major problems later.

Case study: Process and outcome review of a participative ergonomics project in an asphalt production plant,"Evidence supporting the benefits of participatory ergonomics is compelling. Ergonomics may improve productivity, mitigate high-risk activity, promote social connectedness, and inspire innovation. However, the practices are not well integrated in many management systems. Program and process evaluation is required to support the sustainability of the practice. This case study describes the selection of a critical control to improve the manual task of sweeping recycled asphalt product (RAP) at a production plant. A multi-criteria decision making model was applied retrospectively to consider the decisions that were made in terms of selecting the control. The case study was reviewed according to an Occupational Perspective of Health, a spectrum of safety through to productivity (or ""doing-being-becoming-belonging""). Managers were asked for their input regarding the importance of the ergonomics process, the people involved, and the outcomes achieved. The findings revealed that decision-making models may support a participative design process and ergonomics outcomes may be viewed along a performance continuum and, in this case, address many elements important to good work design. The elements that were perceived to be important to the design process included worker involvement, ergonomist skill set, and task selection.",Pazell S.; Burgess-Limerick R.; Horberry T.,Conference Proceeding,"51st Annual Conference of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society of Australia 2016: Healthy, Safe and Productive By Design",2016-01-01,The University of Queensland;Monash University,
Employing Technology to Customize the Flipped Classroom Practice,"Higher education institutions have been a traditional source of innovations, yet, they continue to lag when it comes to employing innovative technological solutions that could improve the educational process. New teaching strategies that employ technology could help improve learning outcomes. This is the emphasis of flipped classroom techniques which rely on technology to change traditional practices in a way that encourages students to become focused on self-paced learning while steering the teaching and learning processes toward a more interactive and engaging setup. This paper summarizes the results from three studies by different instructors that utilized technology to implement the flipped classroom methodology at Texas A&M University at Qatar. The courses employed in the studies represented an array of subjects in engineering education with audiences from a wide range of backgrounds. Each instructor customized his own approach to the flipped classroom concept with each utilizing different technologies to achieve the end goal of improved learning outcomes. The research was concluded by student surveys to assess their views regarding the flipped classroom methodology and how it impacted their learning. The results of the studies demonstrate that non-traditional pedagogical practices that utilize technology to flip the classroom can positively impact students' performance. © IEOM Society International.",Ismail M.; Parsaei H.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management,2016-01-01,Texas A&M University at Qatar,Educational technology ;  Engineering education ;  Flipped classroom ;  Higher education ;  Innovation ;  Teaching and learning
Innovation strategies to develop specific professional skills on photovoltaic systems using laboratory experience guides: Technologies and sustainability education,"The use of new strategies for develop professional skills on photovoltaic systems was designed as result of integrated cooperation between universities and research groups that work in the development of tools to implement an academic program for using solar energy. This paper covers the proposed outcomes that will be achieved during the application of activities, an introduction to the concepts that are considered, the methodological process that is applied, and activities that promote independent work by the students using experiences guide applying photovoltaic systems. There are used during the teaching process preliminary questions to assess the understanding of the concepts and objectives considered. As a result, students will design a final report to validate the outcomes completion. These strategies search the development of skill through courses, gaining as result a solid experience in research aimed to develop photovoltaic technologies as classroom activities in order to keep a sustainability of the program.

Discovery Lab Global: Accelerating innovations⋯ growing innovators,"Discovery Lab Global (DLG) is a not-for-profit Entrepreneurial STEM Lab and Concepts Accelerator for strategic workforce development that focuses primarily on bridging the last 2 years of high school & first 2 years of college. It builds on the insights and lessons-learned gained in the 10-year operation of the original Air Force Research Laboratory's (AFRL) Discovery Lab workforce development program (2005-2015). AFRL Discovery Lab ended in 2015 when the founding director retired to start up Discovery Lab Global as a not-for-profit STEM and strategic workforce development initiative. The presentation will focus on the crucial role that collaboration technologies will play in scaling up from a 100-student program into a 1,000-plus student program with global reach. A. 100-Student AFRL Discovery Lab (2005-2015) The Air Force Research Laboratory's (AFRL) Discovery Lab focused on workforce development across a broad spectrum of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) disciplines in project areas of interest to the Air Force. It averaged over 100 students recruited from across the country to participate in team-based technology projects. Notable project areas include but were not limited to virtual reality, autonomy, mobile apps, cybersecurity, additive manufacturing, small unmanned aerial vehicle (SUAV) engineering, data analytics, and computing electronics to name a few. B. 200-Student Discovery Lab Global (2016+) As mentioned earlier, Discovery Lab Global (DLG) is a not-for-profit Entrepreneurial STEM Lab and Concepts Accelerator with the purpose of accelerating innovations while growing innovators through the formation of team-based student projects. As a not-for-profit, DLG has the freedom to greatly expand its reach to global while still maintaining its focus on giving high school students and undergraduate students early hands on experience designed to strengthen their resume and accelerate their development as entrepreneurial innovators. We've establish a long-term strategic goal of a 1,000 student program to quantify our efforts for global reach. Our initial steps will begin with an interim 200-student goal. C. Deep HoriXons - 200 Avatar Virtual STEM Campus DLG has invested in virtual reality as a technology and tool for large scale collaboration for STEM, Research, and Entrepreneurship with the goal of establishing a 200-avatar virtual campus. However, in the spirit of a Grand Challenge, Discovery Lab Global proposes to combine the programmatic structure of Discovery Lab Global (DLG), the global reach of Deep HoriXons (DHX) virtual campus, and the multiplicative potential of collaboration technology systems for a 1,000 student avatar Collaboration Technologies Grand Challenge. D. 1,000 Avatar Collaboration Technologies Grand Challenge The emergence of virtual reality (VR) technologies is more than an attention grabbing way to make video games more immersive and realistic. It is more than a marketing strategy for business to pull customers across the distances into their show rooms. Virtual reality when combined with a system of collaboration technologies has the potential to create new paradigms in student-driven defense and commercial research for ""pennies on the dollar"" through crowd-source approaches. A Grand Challenge approach is detailed in the presentation.",Williams R.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2016 International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems, CTS 2016",2016-01-01,Discovery Lab - Global (DLG),Collaboration technologies ;  Education ;  Entrepreneurship ;  STEM ;  Virtual reality
RCV: Network monitoring and diagnostic system with interactive user interface,"Minimizing the impact of network convergence events has been an active area of research and innovation since it usually occurs unexpectedly and triggers (often jolting) alarms in network operations centers. Examination of router logs, network management system information, and router configuration reviews are the standard tools for assessment and often do not lead to satisfactory conclusions. We introduce Route Convergence Visualizer providing the network operator with a fast and simple tool to understand what exactly happened and who was impacted during a network convergence event. The main novel ingredients include a) effectiveness of information delivery regarding convergence events, b) programmability of the tool, and c) application of the tool. At last, we will enlighten an indispensable collaboration between network operators and software engineers for SDN solutions which require contributions from two disparate engineering disciplines, networking and application development.",Park S.; Talaulikar K.; Metz C.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2016 International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems, CTS 2016",2016-01-01,Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology;Cisco Systems,Collaboration ;  Computer network ;  Network monitoring ;  Routing ;  Visualization
A study on psychology-based evaluation model for innovation design,"This research tries to explore psychology-based evaluation models for innovation design. In this article, the extensive QFD, developed by Wu, has been adopted for the procedure of innovative design. The major procedure of QFD is to identify the customers’ needs for a product and then convert it into appropriate technical characteristics. According to the priorities of product characteristics, prior engineering parameters will be identified to become the key requirements for a redesign. The extension method will aid Customers’ Requirements (CRs) to transform into product design attributes more comprehensively. For achieving an attractive design, we introduce the Kano model and EGM to construct the evaluation model. The proposed psychology-based evaluation procedure is mainly used in two parts of the innovative design. First, the evaluation process used in the QFD stage can help to identify attractive customers’ needs. Second, the results of in-depth interviews help to discover the trend of innovative design. The flowchart of the proposed innovative design procedure with a psychology-based evaluation has also been developed.",Wu C.; Yang L.,Conference Proceeding,"Applied System Innovation - Proceedings of the International Conference on Applied System Innovation, ICASI 2015",2016-01-01,Taiwan Steel University of Science and Technology;National Kaohsiung Normal University,
Technology transfer through industry-University-government collaboration,"This study examines technology transfer through collaboration between Government, industry and Universities. The Metal Casting Technology Station at the University of Johannesburg (MCTS-UJ) has been a reputed Technology Station and center of excellence for trouble shooting foundry problems and conducting research in South African foundries. The Department of Science and Technology in South Africa funds the Technology Stations Programme (TSP) through the Technology Innovation Agency (TIA). There are eighteen technology stations across the country at various universities and three of these focus in supporting the foundry industry. The mandate of the Technology Station is to develop human capital and support localization through technology and skills transfer. In this paper we discuss two case studies one on human capital development and the other on localization of technology with a partner university in Germany and a local manufacturer in South Africa. Both projects, Research and Innovation in Foundry Technology (RIFT) and inorganic binders for environmental friendly moulding material has benefited graduate students in acquiring the necessary skills and industry with new technology through the use of inorganic binders for environmental friendly moulding material which helped to reduce toxic fumes while mould making.

A comparative review of systemic innovation in the construction and film industries,"Generalising the construction and film industries as a Project Based Inter-Organisational Network (PBION) and Building Information Modelling (BIM) adoption as a systemic change allows phenomena to be compared. The film industry was chosen because of the number of disruptive systemic innovations that have occurred since the late 19th century. Acknowledging that the nature of end products in both industries differ widely, this paper draws fragmentation as common phenomena and is associated with increased transaction costs and lower fixed costs. Due to this research area’s highly abstract interdisciplinary nature, two perspectives are investigated for their explanatory and guiding potential. Structuration theory in a macro-perspective associated with the accumulated changes that occur when implementing a form of systemic innovation whereas CHAT is associated with the use of tools in historically developing interacting activity systems and systemic changes.",Sujan S.; Aksenova G.; Kiviniemi A.; Jones S.,Conference Proceeding,"eWork and eBusiness in Architecture, Engineering and Construction - Proceedings of the 11th European Conference on Product and Process Modelling, ECPPM 2016",2016-01-01,University of Liverpool,
The Orbital-Hub: Low cost platform for human spaceflight after ISS,"The International Space Station ISS demonstrates long-term international cooperation between 15 partner governments as well as significant engineering and programmatic achievement mostly as a compromise of budget, politics, administration and technological feasibility. A paradigm shift to use the ISS more as an Earth observation platform and to more innovation and risk acceptance can be observed in the development of new markets by shifting responsibilities to private entities and broadening research disciplines, demanding faster access by users and including new launcher and experiment facilitator companies. A review of worldwide activities shows that all spacefaring nations are developing their individual programmes for the time after ISS. All partners are basically still interested in LEO and human spaceflight as discussed by the ISECG. ISS follow-on activities should comprise clear scientific and technological objectives combined with the long term view on space exploration. This includes key competences like robotics, internal and external space structures, module/facility and experiment operations as well as supply systems (e. g. ATV). Giving financial feasibility priority, DLR started to investigate future low cost options by evaluating various LEO infrastructure concepts including opportunities for national realisation and international cooperation. Scientists and users from various disciplines were involved to assess the usability of corresponding options. Resulting payloads were based on their Mir and ISS experience with respect to future scientific fundamental and technological research questions. Together with US and European industry, NASA and ESA astronauts, operation specialists, current ISS users and scientists, DLR conducted an extensive concept study using the DLR Concurrent Engineering facility (CEF). The present paper describes the results of these activities with a Phase A design called Orbital-Hub based on a small low cost manned LEO platform including a man-tended free flyer. The first flying H/W components could be realised in the frame of moderate budgets in the next eight years. The Orbital-Hub would guarantee a smooth transition between ISS and further space activities in and beyond LEO and would represent an important step regarding long-term space research, Earth observation respectively monitoring and human space exploration.",Romberg O.; Quantius D.; Philpot C.; Jahnke S.; Seboldt W.; Dittus H.; Baerwalde S.; Schlegel H.; Gold M.; Zamka G.; Da Costa R.; Retat I.; Wohlgemuth R.; Lange M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2016-01-01,Airbus Defence and Space;European Space Agency - ESA;Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR);Bigelow Aerospace,Base platform ;  Free flyer ;  Human spaceflight ;  Low earth orbit ;  Post-ISS
Study on life cycle quality management of the aerospace advanced development flight demonstration project,"The development of aerospace pre research flight demonstration project is conforms to the current trend of space equipment, and it provides technical reserves for the future development of space equipment. The development process of aerospace pre research project is similar to the traditional space project. But the aerospace pre research project has its own characteristics of tight schedule, less fund, great technical uncertainty and diversity suppliers. In order to achieve the flight demonstration test of aerospace pre research project fast, the quality management in the whole life cycle of the project needs to explore an innovation road which is suitable for the project features and guides the quality management work of high efficiency. The development process of aerospace pre research project is divided into three stages: concept design, prototype and flight demonstration. At the beginning of the project, tailor-made quality management regulations are defined. The ""Quality Assurance Program"" is established, and each development stage has focused on the quality work of his own, for instance, the concept design stage pays close attention to the correctness and feasibility of the principle, the prototype stage is focused on the ground test results and the realization of the design and production, the flight demonstration stage focus on the impact of changes in the state of technology, and concerns about whether the reliability and manufacturing process of products meet the requirements. During the developing course, we work in an innovative manner. A number of new fine quality management methods are widely used, such as ""quality tips everyday"", ""quality regulations release to the final suppliers"", ""experts' comments Itemization"", ""Quality supervisor Tracking production and test"", ""field investigation and scientific supplier management"". We, meanwhile, make full use of the information and network technology to make the quality management becomes more efficient. Through developing and implicating of the electronic network quality board, the quality consciousness of whole staff is improved. By establishing and operating the quality information management and assistant decision system, the leaders of the project can grasp the dynamic quality information quickly, and the assistance decisions are also provided to them. Through the implementation of the whole life cycle quality control methods, the flight test of the aerospace pre research project achieves a complete success. It also provides a useful reference for the quality management of future aerospace pre research project.",Haiguang L.; Keqin L.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2016-01-01,China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology,Advanced development ;  Flight demonstration project ;  Life cycle ;  Quality management
EDEN ISS: Human factors and sustainability for space and earth analogue,"In light of upcoming plans for human Moon/Mars missions, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and its partners are developing a greenhouse to be tested at the German Neumayer station III in Antarctica: the EDEN ISS project. One critical component of future human exploration of unknown worlds will be the supply of edible food for crewmembers. Thus, developing innovations for the cultivation of food in closed-loop systems will become essential for future missions.

The innovation landscape within a large government agency: Promising practices from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration,"The NASA Mission is to ""Drive advances in science, technology, aeronautics and space exploration to enhance knowledge, education, innovation, economic vitality, and stewardship of Earth. NASA's complementary Vision is to ""reach for new heights and reveal the unknown for the benefit of humankind"" (NASA Strategic Plan). NASA's future success will be determined largely by the investment and innovations made today in scientific research, technology and our workforce. To achieve mission success through the highest standards in engineering, research, operations and management, NASA is committed to nurturing an organizational culture of innovation. Innovation is the application of a novel approach that provides improved outcomes or enables new outcomes to create value for people. Innovation as defined here, is broadly applied to technological, scientific, engineering, educational, outreach and organizational activities across NASA. Innovation is essential to enable NASA to achieve all three Strategic Goals outlined in the NASA Strategic Plan. The first strategic goal focuses on expanding the frontiers of knowledge, capability, and opportunity in space. The second strategic goal focuses on our work to improve the understanding of life on Earth. Finally, the third strategic goal focuses on major management priorities and challenges. This paper builds on a framework proposed by Pisano which maps the Innovation landscape into four quadrants, depending on whether the innovation pursues new approaches in the area of technology or organizational processes. While the Pisano analysis is applied to private sector firms, this paper adapts the framework to a large, public sector agency and explores Routine, Disruptive, Revolutionary and Transformative innovations. Routine innovation builds on existing technological capabilities and fits within the existing organizational model. Disruptive innovation requires organizational change rather than a breakthrough in technology, as proposed by Christensen. Revolutionary innovation is the counterpoint to disruptive innovation, requiring a technological breakthrough within the existing organization. Transformative innovation combines technological and organizational disruptions. Assessing innovation along these two dimensions helps provide a balanced strategy for investment in terms of the degree that innovations involve a change in technology a change in organizational practices. Leadership within an organization can evaluate how investment in each of the four areas contributes to meeting strategic goals. This paper maps innovation activities within NASA to the four quadrants of the Innovation Landscape and presents promising practices that illustrate dynamics of innovation within a large government agency.",Wood D.; Newman D.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2016-01-01,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,

"Space solar at the 2016 defense, diplomacy, and development technology innovation pitch challenge","It has been widely recognized that the world is in need of sustainable sources of energy. One possibility is space solar, in which sunlight is collected in space (where it is brighter than anywhere on earth and is unaffected by clouds or night) and sent wirelessly to the earth. This would be a clean, constant, globally dispatchable source of energy. Recent advances in several key technologies now make it imperative to seriously investigate space solar as a prospective future energy source. These technologies include advancements in the mass production of spacecraft, breakthroughs in power conversion electronics and lightweight materials, emerging space robotics capabilities, and reusable commercial launch. Though the space solar has been examined in the past, these new developments combined with the unprecedented projected need for clean energy demand that it now be included as part of any ""all of the above"" energy strategy.

Sustainable technology management model for space debris control,"Today, the development of space technology has provoked pollution that expands beyond the frontiers of earth surface becoming a latent threat for space activities. The generation of space debris originated from different causes such as the collision of solid objects in space, fuel tank explosions, meteor impacts or satellite malfunctioning has generated pollution in space threatening space activities. The world space agencies are searching for solutions to mitigate and control debris located on low earth orbits, which makes more important to consider the space debris problem from an integral point of view. This work aims to present research advances to elaborate a proposal of a technology management model that integrates sustainable strategies for the decision makers referred upon the control of satellite final disposal at the end of use life. The model is based on the planning, evaluation, control, execution, and implementation processes. The technology management is an industrial activity and an educational and research emerging field that has not being consistently defined, where innovation processes through research and development projects to introduce the use of technology in products, industrial processes and in other structural and functional fields of an organization, as well as the utilization of this knowledge in the solution of different society, human being and environmental problems are included. In a addition, this proposal suggests the analysis of product life cycle as a tool incorporated within the satellite design process to identify the indicators to establish the necessary sustainable characteristics to be observed to generate a comprehensive proposal of the technology management model for space projects in Mexico.

LAUNCH: User experience design of the innovation to flight portal,"The space mission engineering process is moving from a system supported by separated documents and computer applications to shared, networked software environments. New approaches such as modelbased systems engineering (MBSE) rely on a single-source of truth, and coordinated inputs and outputs to that system. The central store of data has utility to a variety of analyses, reports, information searches, presentations, and more. As a result, there are multiple types of user, each with different motivations and goals. In this situation, it is important to consider a user-centered design approach to simplify the user interface, and to create efficient, intuitive workflows. As part of the Launch MBSE project at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the systems engineering team has incorporated user-centered design into the development process to continually improve the user-facing interfaces to the information contained in the model. The Launch portal is a web-based system that assists mission planners in manifesting launches, aggregating launch vehicle data, and flying innovations. This portal is meant to communicate, educate, and bridge the divide between innovation/technology and launch/project system engineering communities by providing users with with the latest and most up-to-date in performance and manifest information. The portal uses a Model Based Engineering Environment (MBEE) architecture that provides a complete open source tool set in the Engineering Modeling System (EMS). The framework features a backend model-management tool and a front-end web-based interface allowing engineers to access and connect to repository data. Open MBEE combines the design metrics of Systems Modelling Language (SysML) with the graphical documentation created using EMS. The systems engineering team has taken a collaborative, embedded, design approach to facilitate communication across team members and to maintain a flexible software-development model. The user-centered design process includes conducting user research, generating personas, creating task flows, mock-ups, rapid prototyping, and continuous iteration on design and development with the help of user input at every step of the process.",Alkalai L.; Derewa C.; Srivastava P.; Karlsson D.; Huang C.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2016-01-01,Jet Propulsion Laboratory;JPL,

Drones for live streaming of visuals for people with limited mobility,"Robotics is the field currently taking its place as a leading candidate for dramatic changes in everyday life. Advances in the past 10 years in sensing, actuator and power technologies have fuelled an explosion of opportunities in this exciting, and surprisingly affordable domain. Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (drones) are being rapidly developed for research, public service, and commercial applications, all around the globe. Drones offer a number of unique affordances to mobile technology research for community empowerment and 'extreme user' access: they are relatively inexpensive, easy to operate and to fit with alternative interfaces for people of all abilities, and are readily available. Furthermore, they can carry a payload of light, inexpensive, and off-the-shelf sensors that can be used to support a wide range of research efforts. A potential helping application has been developed in UCD for live streaming of visuals for people with limited mobility. The aim is to use drones and virtual reality as surrogates to provide access to visual information to differently-abled people. This paper will summarize the state of the art in drones research in terms of the affordances to assistive technology. Imagine being able to take any sport or imagine any far-away and otherwise inaccessible cultural heritage or educational site and to bring these rich assets to life within an immersive environment. The paper proposes a system to integrate virtual reality (VR) with a low-cost unmanned, semi-autonomous quad rotor. This quad rotor with a VR headset would allow for first-person vision and manipulation using the Robot Operating System. The system would enable the user to move the quad rotor remotely using natural head movements, which could be tracked by the VR headset and translated into six degrees of freedom commands that would then be sent to the quad rotor. This would facilitate operation when compared to commercially available controller methods, as it would immerse the user in the robot's environment. The paper presents the software components that will allow people off site to strap themselves into a virtual reality headset (i.e. Oculus Rift at the top end of technology, or one of the many emerging affordable VR headsets such as Google cardboard) and then-via footage taken from drone flights and other digital media-to be able to participate virtually, in real time, with other users who are all synchronously immersed in these environments. From the point of view of the camera on the plane overhead, the viewer can get a very good impression of a site, seeing things that you would not normally be visible even during a 'real' walk of the same terrain. Overtime, the aim is to facilitate people with limited mobility to have access to live streaming of visuals and thus to experience the sense of empowerment and inclusion that live engagement in physical activity can inspire and support.",Mangina E.; O'Keeffe E.; Eyerman J.; Goodman L.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Virtual Systems and Multimedia, VSMM 2016",2016-01-01,RTI International;School of Computer Science;College of Engineering,Context-Awareness ;  Distance learning ;  Distributed Computing ;  Educational Technology ;  Social Implications of Technology (Cultural Differences) ;  Technological Innovation ;  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ;  Virtual Reality

"Glass challenges – Past, present, and future","Over the last twenty years we have worked with glass primarily with its application focused on structures. A summary of where this journey began and where it has taken us over this period will be a part of this paper along with an explanation of the goals that drove the research behind its development. Studies in the use of glass structurally have diversified in more recent times towards a wider consideration of new glass materials, such as thin glass, and their potential. There is no doubt that in the last ten years there has been an increased focus on building envelope energy control. Glass, being an important part of this equation, is facing its biggest challenge yet to evolve into something that can efficiently participate in this necessary evolution. The tension between the human need of light in habitable buildings and the reduction of energy gain/loss through the transparency of glass is a paradox. The author’s studies have focused on this paradox over the last two years in studying the role that glass plays in managing energy in building envelope, the integration of energy/light control within glass assemblies lies and ultimately within glass itself. The paper aims to capture the past, present, and future of glass in the fields of engineering applications for structures and building physics. Questions are posed as to where further studies are required, along with identifying on-going research that the author believes is of particular importance to future applications. Glass has a challenging future. It is a material that is uniquely coveted by human life in the fact that it provides shelter and light simultaneously. No other material can do this with the same level of solidity and robustness to ageing; it is essentially a natural material that people have a strong affinity with. And yet with the challenges we face on the planet, we must take responsibility for how we heat and cool our buildings such that energy is conserved. The use of glass is pinpointed as an easy way to help balance the equation. What does this mean to us as we face a future of buildings with less glass? What does this mean to the glass industry and the overall output of glass manufacture across the globe? A review of the future of glass is undertaken given these challenges and our overwhelming need for glass to play a part of our future as a civilization. Our physiological well-being depends on it and our architecture may no longer able to speak to the needs of humanity in the design of buildings. We all have a significant duty within our industry specialism to respond to these challenges, to accelerate our research. This means we must lobby those with influence and finance to participate, to recognize the challenges and support our research. Glass is already losing this battle with regards to its place in building envelope with the changing energy codes and so the importance of our focus on innovation for it to remain relevant is our biggest challenge yet.",O’Callaghan J.,Conference Proceeding,"Structures and Architecture - Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Structures and Architecture, ICSA 2016",2016-01-01,Eckersley O’Callaghan,

Innovation and the cost of quality: Analysis and implications of current research,"Prajogo and Sohal (2001) aimed to find a relationship between total quality management (TQM) and innovation. Their extensive analysis of the state of the research led to the conclusion that the relationship between innovation and cost of quality (COQ) requires to be investigated since it was not considered in previous studies. COQ being an important part of quality planning area, according to Rose (2014), the previous statement thus needs to be investigated. The current work attempts to update and elucidate the veracity of Prajogo and Sohal's (2001) conclusions regarding the lack of consideration of innovation as an important part of the COQ theoretical framework. To do so, an analysis of the current state of research in this area was conducted based on the State-of-the-Art-Matrix (SAM) approach. SAM methodology defines search query, gathering procedures, quality assessment and analysis procedures to obtain and analyze a sample of research publications in the open literature. No clear relationship between innovation and COQ, also known as cost of poor quality (COPQ) and quality cost, was found; this confirms Prajogo and Sohal's (2001) conclusions several years after their research. In addition, other analyses were performed using the sample of research articles to obtain working knowledge in the area of COQ. In summary, this work brings to light the very real voids that are currently present in COQ research such as the existence of a possible relationship between innovation and COQ.",Elizondo-Noriega A.; Güemes-Castorena D.; Beruvides M.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 International Annual Conference of the American Society for Engineering Management, ASEM 2016",2016-01-01,Texas Tech University;Tecnológico de Monterrey,Big Q ;  Cost of poor quality ;  Research void

Systems archetypes in time banking: The first step,"This paper is the first step in a long-term analysis of so-called systems archetypes in time banking. To the author's knowledge these approaches have never been combined and, thus, in its essence this project is multidisciplinary. It combines the approach of system engineering, specifically systems dynamics, with socio-economic concepts. This soft system consisting of a time banking social-economy approach can be described in terms of complementary economics. Its aim is to build communities on basis of equal economic exchange. The use of time banking, like any other system, is often negatively affected by recurring issues which can be identified as system archetypes. The aim of this first paper in an ongoing project is to identify these archetypes and to draft preliminary steps for future research. Several archetypes are here identified, described and exemplified.",Valek L.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 28th International Business Information Management Association Conference - Vision 2020: Innovation Management, Development Sustainability, and Competitive Economic Growth",2016-01-01,Univerzita Hradec Králové,Social economy ;  Systems archetype ;  Systems thinking ;  Time bank
Leadership styles in project management,"It is widely recognized by academics and the community of practice that the management of people plays an important role in project management, because it takes more than technical skills to become a successful project manager. Project managers need good and effective people skills to manage the people in their projects. There has been a considerable discussion throughout the history about what makes a good leader. Over the last 80 years there have been several main schools of leadership theory. A considerable body of research has been conducted on leadership styles, with two styles getting more interest than others. Those two leadership styles are transactional and transformational style, identified by Bass (1990). Muller and Turner (2007) concluded, that the transformational leadership style is preferred on complex change projects and a transactional style preferred on simple, engineering projects. To verify their conclusion about the transactional leadership, a study investigating leadership styles in 2 Czech engineering companies was conducted. In total, 72 completed questionnaires were obtained. The goal was to discover what kind of a leadership style is used by leaders in engineering companies and if the chosen style matches leader's performance expectations.",Mičík M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 28th International Business Information Management Association Conference - Vision 2020: Innovation Management, Development Sustainability, and Competitive Economic Growth",2016-01-01,University of West Bohemia,Competency ;  Transactional leadership ;  Transformational leadership

Workplace wellbeing - An ergonomics approach focus on workplace usability evaluation,"In the last years, a wide range of international standards has been developed to define the general principles of user-centred design and good practice in user interface design. ISO 9241-11 and ISO 9241-210 are recognized as important standards related to usability. ISO 9241-11 suggests that usability measures should cover: effectiveness (the ability of users to complete tasks using the system, and the quality of the output of those tasks), efficiency (the level of resource consumed in performing tasks) and users' satisfaction (subjective perception when using the product, process or system). These basic knowledge on usability concept create the article background in order to describe a proposed methodology for the global assessments of the ergonomics interventions in the case of industrial system. The research scenario consists in a survey based on a developed questionnaire that evaluate the ergonomics interventions, in terms of usability. In addition, the results of an experimental research demonstrate the testing and validation of the proposed approach. The method could be seen as an ergonomics continuous improvement one.",Gaureanu A.; Weinschrott H.; Mateescu A.; Ghici A.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 28th International Business Information Management Association Conference - Vision 2020: Innovation Management, Development Sustainability, and Competitive Economic Growth",2016-01-01,Universitatea Politehnica Timisoara,Assessment ;  Ergonomics ;  Improvement ;  Usability ;  Workplace

Open data offers government, companies and citizens information to make better decisions. We claim Public Administrations, that are the main producers and one of the consumers of Open Data, might effectively extract important information by integrating its own data with open data sources. This paper reports the activities carried on during a research project on Open Data for Youth Policies. The project was devoted to explore the youth situation in the municipalities and provinces of the Emilia Romagna region (Italy), in particular, to examine data on population, education and work. We identified interesting data sources both from the open data community and from the private repositories of local governments related to the Youth Policies. The selected sources have been integrated and, the result of the integration by means of a useful navigator tool have been shown up. In the end, we published new information on the web as Linked Open Data. Since the process applied and the tools used are generic, we trust this paper to be an example and a guide for new projects that aims to create new knowledge through Open Data.",Beneventano D.; Bergamaschi S.; Gagliardelli L.; Po L.,Book Series,Communications in Computer and Information Science,2016-01-01,Università degli Studi di Modena e Reggio Emilia,Data integration ;  Data visualization ;  Emilia romagna region ;  Linked open data ;  Municipality of modena ;  Open government data ;  Youth policies
"Service as mandate: How American land-grant universities shaped the modern world, 1920-2015","Established by the Morrill Land-Grant College Act of 1862, America's land-grant universities have had far-reaching influences on the United States and the world. Service as Mandate, Alan I Marcus's second edited collection of insightful essays about land-grant universities, explores how these universities have adapted to meet the challenges of the past sixty-five years and how, having done so, they have helped to create the modern world. From their founding, land-grant schools have provided educational opportunities to millions, producing many of the nation's scientific, technical, and agricultural leaders and spawning countless technological and agricultural innovations. Nevertheless, their history has not always been smooth or without controversy or setbacks. These vital centers of learning and research have in fact been redefined and reconceptualized many times and today bear only a cursory resemblance to their original incarnations. The thirteen essays in this collection explore such themes as the emphasis on food science and home economics, the country life movement, the evolution of a public research system, the rise of aerospace engineering, the effects of the GI Bill, the teaching of military science, the sustainable agriculture movement, and the development of golf-turf science. Woven together, these expertly curated scenes, vignettes, and episodes powerfully illustrate these institutions' ability to flex and adapt to serve the educational needs of an ever-changing American citizenry. By dint of their mission to remedy social, economic, and technical problems; to improve standards of living; and to enhance the quality of life, land-grant universities are destined and intended to be agents of change-a role that finds them at times both celebrated and hotly contested, even vilified. A readable and fascinating exploration of land-grant universities, Service as Mandate offers a vital exploration of these dynamic institutions to educators, policy makers, students, and the wider communities that land-grant universities serve.",Marcus A.,Book,"Service as Mandate: How American Land-Grant Universities Shaped the Modern World, 1920-2015",2016-01-01,Mississippi State University,
ARIES - Development of accelerator technology in Europe 2017-2020: Global and local consequences,"The article describes chosen, yet key parts of newly established European, infrastructural research and development project ARIES (2017-2020) - Accelerator Research and Innovation for European Science and Society, to be realized inside the framework of the H2020 programme. Two institutions from Poland participate in ARIES - these are Warsaw University of Technology and Institute of Nuclear Chemistry and Technology. ARIES is a topical continuation of the previous infrastructural accelerator projects realized uninterruptedly since 2003 - FP6 CARE - Coordinated Accelerator Research in Europe and FP7 TIARA - Test Infrastructure and Accelerator Research Area, EuCARD - European Coordination for Accelerator Research and Development, and EuCARD2. The article is simultaneously a part of a series of papers concerning the participation of Polish doctoral students and young researchers, especially from the Warsaw University of Technology, in large European and world experiments of the discovery class, including building large research infrastructures like: FLASH and EXFEL, ESS, ITER and DEMO, IFMIF, but also satellites built by the ESA, etc. ARIES embraces, among others, the following subjects: energy efficiency and management, cost lowering, miniaturization and ultra-high field gradients, promotion innovation, industrial applications, societal implications, new materials and components, new methods of particles acceleration including laser-plasma-particles interaction, and building new generations of systems.",Romaniuk R.,Journal,International Journal of Electronics and Telecommunications,2016-01-01,Politechnika Warszawska,Accelerator science and technology ;  Large research infrastructures ;  Renewing and maintenance of large research infrastructures ;  Research and technical innovations in Europe ;  Research efforts in Europe ;  Research experiments of discovery class ;  Social implications ;  Technology transfer issues to industry
Use and uptake of e-books in the lens of unified theory of acceptance and use of technology,"As digital penetration is accelerated, consumers have been exposed to a variety of digital content. As such, a projection is suggested that printed books will lose the battle and be rendered obsolete with ebooks' cost-effectiveness and ubiquity. By contrast, there is a prediction that consumers will still prefer printed books for intensive reading and rather use e-books just for fun and pleasure. To respond to the research call, this study examines why and how individuals adopt and use e-books in the digital innovation era by utilizing the theory of UTAUT together with cognitive judgmental processes. The survey methodology with 1,419 consumers was used to test the research model by employing structural equation modeling. The results of the study show that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and facilitating conditions are critical to the adoption and use of e-books. Gender, age, and experience have no moderating impacts in this study. Job relevance, result demonstrability, and effort expectancy have a positive impact on performance expectancy. Output quality shows a moderating influence between job relevance and performance expectancy. This study also discusses theoretical and practical implications by bridging every-changing consumer technology use and users' cognitive impact with the case of ebooks.",Yoo D.; Roh J.,Conference Proceeding,"Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems, PACIS 2016 - Proceedings",2016-01-01,Rowan University;Virginia State University,Cognitive judgmental processes ;  Consumer information technology ;  E-books ;  Technology mediated learning ;  Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology
An overview of CLT research and implementation in North America,"Although not yet seen as common practice, building with cross laminated timber (CLT) is gaining momentum in North America. Behind the scenes of the widely publicized project initiatives such as the Wood Innovation Design Centre Building in Canada and the recent U.S. Tall Wood Building Competition, substantial research, engineering, and development has been completed or is underway to enable the adoption of this innovative building system. This paper presents a brief overview of the current status of CLT building development in North America, highlighting some recent U.S. and Canadian research efforts related to CLT system performance, and identifies future CLT research directions based on the needs of the North American market. The majority of the research summarized herein is from a recent CLT research workshop in Madison, Wisconsin, USA, organized by the USDA Forest Products Laboratory. The opportunity and need for coordination in CLT research and development among the global timber engineering community are also highlighted in the conclusions of this paper.",Pei S.; Rammer D.; Popovski M.; Williamson T.; Line P.; Van De Lindt J.,Conference Proceeding,WCTE 2016 - World Conference on Timber Engineering,2016-01-01,"FPInnovations, Canada;Colorado School of Mines;Colorado State University;USDA Forest Products Laboratory;Timber Engineering LLC;American Wood Council",Building performances ;  Cross laminated timber ;  North American market ;  Research and development ;  Tall Wood Building
Entrepreneurship Education: A Tool for Development of Technological Innovation,"The theoretical and practical capacitation on entrepreneurship is a technical and scientific process of technical and scientific development that aims at developing the abilities and competences to businessmen, future entrepreneurs or potential businessmen, to promote social and economic development, generation of jobs and income, professional efficiency and business strategies. This technological development can be pointed as a propeller of the dynamic factors of development in Brazil. While Brazil moves towards development, the universities have a role of promoting agents, providing theoretical-practical support for the entrepreneurship and innovation. This work has as an aim to identify, explain and evaluate how the subject Entrepreneurship has an impact on the students of Business Administration, Engineering and Computer Science (IT) developing technological innovations generated in incubated companies that have a technological basis and graduated (companies that have finished their process in the incubators). The research has been done with incubated entrepreneurs and graduates that had followed the subject of entrepreneurship and others that had not done it. It is an exploratory practice study on a sample of 30 businesspeople, selected among incubated companies of technological basis, with less than 2 years of foundation, and graduated with less than 4 years. The result has allowed us to observe a significant percentual increase in the group that has taken the discipline. This fact shows that, for the group that has taken the subject of entrepreneurship, there is a direct relationship with the development of the technological innovation. A conclusion can be reached that the obtained result shows the importance of the subject of entrepreneurship for the democratization of the entrepreneur culture, expansion of the professional teaching and the technological development. The interest lies in relating the Public Policy of Technological Development, later than the promulgation of the Law of Technological Innovation (http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2004-2006/2004/lei/l10.973.htm) with the obtained results and to debate the strategies and practices of work in both interviewed groups, so that we can confirm that the creation of technology is really significant.

Beyond intermediation: The open innovation arena as an actor enabling joint knowledge creation,"The open innovation paradigm has created opportunities for the emergence of new actors to provide support for open innovation. It is acknowledged that knowledge creation is pivotal to innovation, but this has yet to be discussed in the context of open innovation intermediation. This paper based on a longitudinal study of SAFER, a traffic and vehicle safety research centre in Sweden, explores the role of an actor whose objective is to support joint knowledge creation in open innovation. Theoretical models of knowledge creation are used in the analysis and the identified activities go beyond intermediation, and include peer collaboration and mobilisation of a collective strategic body. These activities are fundamental to an open innovation arena - here introduced as a new type of actor. The paper challenges the established focal firm perspective in open innovation and introduces the open innovation arena to underline knowledge creation among peers.",Elmquist M.; Ollila S.; Yström A.,Journal,International Journal of Technology Management,2016-01-01,Chalmers University of Technology,Automotive ;  Ba ;  Case study ;  Innovation management ;  Inter-organisational collaboration ;  Intermediary ;  Knowledge creation ;  Open innovation ;  Qualitative research ;  SECI
Online community as space for knowledge flows,"Online communities frequently create significant economic and relational value for community participants and beyond. It is widely accepted that the underlying source of such value is the collective flow of knowledge among community participants. We distinguish the conditions for flows of tacit and explicit knowledge in online communities and advance an unconventional theoretical conjecture: Online communities give rise to tacit knowledge flows between participants. The crucial condition for these flows is not the advent of novel, digital technology as often portrayed in the literature, but instead the technology's domestication by humanity and the sociality it affords. This conjecture holds profound implications for theory and research in the study of management and organization, as well as their relation to information technology.",Faraj S.; von Krogh G.; Monteiro E.; Lakhani K.,Journal,Information Systems Research,2016-01-01,Desautels Faculty of Management;ETH Zürich;Harvard Business School;Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Community of practice ;  Digital platform ;  Digital technology ;  Epistemic community ;  Innovation ;  Knowledge creation ;  Knowledge sharing ;  Knowledge-based view ;  Online community ;  Open source software ;  Organization form ;  Organization theory ;  Organizational knowledge creation theory ;  Tacit knowledge ;  Value creation
Does ownership heterogeneity matter in technological catch ups? Empirical evidence from Chinese SOEs and POEs,"Ownership heterogeneity matters in firms' technological catch-up process. By combining visibility and capability logics, we propose that at the earlier stage of catch-up, SOEs are more likely to perform technology importation than technology assimilation, while POEs are more likely to perform technology assimilation than technology importation. Also, at the later stage of catch-up, SOEs are more likely to perform technology innovation than technology assimilation, while POEs are more likely to integrate various technology activities. Based upon a sample of SOEs and POEs in a technology cluster in China, our results support these arguments.",Wei J.; Liu Y.; Jiang S.; Zhang Z.,Journal,International Journal of Technology Management,2016-01-01,"School of Management, Zhejiang University;Wuhan University;South China University of Technology",China ;  Innovation ;  Ownership heterogeneity ;  Technology catch up

Seeking new ways of innovating in industry-research collaboration practice,"This chapter sheds light on the dynamics of innovation activity and its prerequisites for industry-research collaboration practice. It focuses on a particular intentional attempt to change the prerequisites of innovations. This new kind of research programme aimed to improve the competitiveness of the Finnish metals and engineering industry through enhancing innovations and industrial renewal. Three theoretical lenses were used in reflecting collaboration practice and learning in the programme. Two examples of changes in collaboration activity were presented and analysed within the broader context of the programme. The findings present how the characteristics of the programme and its management practices seemed to construct favourable conditions for co-innovating. The interpretations were founded on the reflections made by the four persons in charge of leading the programme. The chapter is concluded by summing up the results in terms of insight gained, as well as a general framework that aims to support practical efforts to create better prerequisites and conditions for industry-research collaboration in innovation activity.",Nuutinen M.; Seppänen M.; Smedlund A.; Kaasinen E.,Book,Innovating in Practice: Perspectives and Experiences,2016-01-01,Aalto University;Teknologian Tutkimuskeskus VTT;Tampere University,
The constitution of a responsible research and innovation policy: Tensions in implementation and regulation,"European scientific and technological policy recommends better aligning the process and results of activities of research and engineering with the values, needs, and expectations of European society. Nevertheless, this progressive intensification of the narrative, as a response to demands for greater responsibility, must contend with other present discourses that function as ideological prescriptions and envisage innovation as a motor for economic competitiveness. There is a basic tension that is clear in the apparent paradox of the new social context of scientific-Technological activity, which, on the one hand, is subject to a growing demand for responsible models of research and innovation, and on the other hand, is implemented for macroeconomic results. Our analysis strategy is to reclaim this issue, which is closely linked to the interests that intersect in the generation of knowledge, the criteria that govern the dynamics of the scientific-Technological system, and the values that guide scientific policy. Within this basic tension we find a myriad of heterogeneous elements that sometimes contradict each other and that compete amongst themselves for alternative ways to implement and regulate the dynamics of the system of science, technology and innovation. The model of research and innovation developed by European and national policies in response to global challenges is created through the management of this tension.",Eizagirre A.,Journal,Politica y Sociedad,2016-01-01,Mondragon Unibertsitatea,Governance ;  Policy ;  Responsible Research And Innovation ;  Values
"Collaborative Paradigm of Preventive, Personalized, and Precision Medicine with Point-of-Care Technologies","Recent advances in biosensors, medical instrumentation, and information processing and communication technologies (ICT) have enabled significant improvements in healthcare. However, these technologies have been mainly applied in clinical environments, such as hospitals and healthcare facilities, under managed care by well-trained and specialized individuals. The global challenge of providing quality healthcare at affordable cost leads to the proposed paradigm of P reventive, Personalized, and Precision Medicine that requires a seamless use of technology and infrastructure support for patients and healthcare providers at point-of-care (POC) locations including homes, semi or pre-clinical facilities, and hospitals. The complexity of the global healthcare challenge necessitates strong collaborative interdisciplinary synergies involving all stakeholder groups including academia, federal research institutions, industry, regulatory agencies, and clinical communities. It is critical to evolve with collaborative efforts on the translation of research to technology development toward clinical validation and potential healthcare applications. This special issue is focused on technology innovation and translational research for POC applications with potential impact in improving global healthcare in the respective areas. Some of these papers were presented at the NIH-IEEE Strategic Conference on Healthcare Innovations and POC Technologies for Precision Medicine (HI-POCT) held at the NIH on November 9-10, 2015.

"Design thinking as mindset, process, and toolbox: Experiences from research and teaching at the university of St.Gallen","Design Thinking is a development that has recently attracted significant attention in the management discourse. The Institute of Information Management at the University of St.Gallen, the academic home of all three authors, has been conducting Design Thinking teaching and research for 10 years. In this study, Design Thinking is defined as: mindset, process, and toolbox. As a mindset, Design Thinking is characterized by several key principles: a combination of divergent and convergent thinking, a strong orientation to both obvious and hidden needs of customers and users, and prototyping. As a process, Design Thinking is seen as a combination of a micro- and a macro-process. The micro-process-as innovation process per se-consists of these steps: “Define the Problem”, “Needfinding and Synthesis”, “Ideate”, “Prototype” and “Test”. The macro-process consists of milestones manifested in prototypes that must fulfill defined requirements. As a toolbox, Design Thinking refers to the application of numerous methods and techniques from various disciplines: design, but also engineering, informatics, and psychology. Today, a growing number of companies, consulting firms, and universities use Design Thinking, continuously enlarging and re-defining its meaning. At University of St.Gallen, Design Thinking is taught as a problem-based course, together with research partner companies, with more than 40 projects successfully completed over the past 10 years. Research in Design Thinking at the University of St.Gallen focuses on aspects of modeling the Design Thinking processes and corporate entrepreneurship. In the near future, Design Thinking is expected to be deployed as an innovative method in corporations and also become an integral part of management education, particularly innovation. In addition, it will be developed further at the interface of design, design management and engineering sciences.",Brenner W.; Uebernickel F.; Abrell T.,Book,Design Thinking for Innovation: Research and Practice,2016-01-01,University of St. Gallen,Design thinking ;  Information management ;  User-centered innovation

Design thinking in IS research projects: Mindset and toolset perspective,"Many see the primary impact of Design Thinking in the area of industrial innovation. Given the engineering background of the methodology, this is definitely the most straightforward approach, with its practice-oriented nature. We claim, however, that Design Thinking-defined as the mindset as well as the toolset-can significantly contribute to the success of academic research in the Information Systems area. While building on the notion of inquiry from a philosophy of science, as well as the concept of a mindset from psychology, we offer an extended view of Design Thinking as a malleable paradigm. We argue that implementing Design Thinking phases in Information Systems research projects will contribute to a better traceability and understanding of the creative processes, as well as to the credibility of their results. We postulate that Design Thinking will also contribute to new findings, thus leveraging the knowledge contribution. We, provide proven and tested practical guidance on how Design Thinking can be embedded in research projects. While this paper primarily addresses an academic audience, practitioners and facilitators in the field of Design Thinking may benefit from a philosophical perspective on this paradigm.",Dolata M.; Schwabe G.,Book,Design Thinking for Innovation: Research and Practice,2016-01-01,Universität Zürich,Design science research ;  Design thinking ;  Information systems ;  Mindset vs. toolset ;  Modes of inquiry ;  Scientific method
Research on influence factors of the formation of virtual innovation clusters,"With the development of science and technology and the increasingly fierce competition of innovation, the virtual innovation cluster (VIC) has become an important way of innovation. This paper studies the influence factors of the formation of VIC, in order that more VICs can be built well. A new model of factors is proposed, in which some new variables such as searching for partners, negotiation, internal recognition, external recognition and structure level are used to describe the situation of VIC's formation, and other new variables such as members' quality and relationship are increased into the influence factors. The empirical research shows that the factors of the government' s promotion, members' quality, members' relationship and innovative spirit play an important role in the formation of VIC.",Qiu D.; Wu Q.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,2016-01-01,Fujian University of Technology;Fuzhou University,Formation ;  Influence factors ;  Innovation cluster ;  Virtual cluster
Dynamic pressure-sensitive paint demonstration in aedc propulsion wind tunnel 16T,"Unsteady aerodynamics have been difficult to measure since the beginning days of wind tunnel testing. Distributed dynamic loads have been determined by using special (dynamic) transducers that measure pressure fluctuations at a few to several hundred locations on a wind tunnel model and then integrating the pressure fluctuations over a specified area. Typical data acquisition systems that capture the pressure fluctuations record at rates from 50,000-100,000 samples/channel/s and can generate many terabytes of raw data. Processing the large amount of data generated cannot be accomplished at most continuous-flow wind tunnel facilities, so selected data are processed for evaluation during testing. Another area of concern over the last several decades has been weapons bay acoustics and their effect on store separation. The U.S. Air Force (USAF) needs to understand the aerodynamics of payloads separating from aircraft to support weapons system design and certification. Customers to the Air Force such as Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company have been developing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models of stores separation in order to reduce the amount of wind tunnel and flight testing required for the certification process on each weapon and platform. Currently CFD validation can only be performed at point locations where dynamic pressure transducers are installed. Engineers at the Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC) have utilized a steady-state pressure-sensitive paint (PSP) capability in Propulsion Wind Tunnel (PWT) 16T to acquire surface pressure data on wind tunnel models. A logical next step was to extend this capability to measure fluctuating pressures with PSP. Innovative Scientific Solutions, Inc. (ISSI) has developed a fast-responding PSP under USAF and NASA Phase II small business innovation research (SBIR) grants that can detect pressure fluctuations up to 20 kHz. This was made possible by new developments in high-speed camera technology and brighter light-emitting diode (LED) technology. However, the test section in 16T places the test article approximately 8-11 ft away from cameras and LEDs. Detecting the fluorescence emitted by the fast PSP with exposure times in the hundreds of microseconds would be a challenge. In support of the Air-Delivered Weapon Certification Cost Reduction program, ISSI was awarded a grant to demonstrate the fast PSP capability in 16T, with AEDC and Lockheed as partners. ISSI would provide the technical assistance, equipment and PSP, Lockheed would provide the test article, and AEDC would develop data acquisition and image processing software and perform the wind tunnel testing in 16T. Power spectral density (PSD) comparisons are made between the fast PSP and conventional dynamic pressure transducers. In addition, the complete spatial distribution of the sound pressure level (SPL) at selected frequencies are presented to aid understanding of the data and provide additional insight. Proper orthogonal decomposition is applied to the data for identification of relevant flow structures.",Sellers M.; Nelson M.; Crafton J.,Conference Proceeding,54th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting,2016-01-01,"Innovative Scientific Solutions, Inc.;Arnold AFB",
"The illustrated road to the modern airliner, 1915-1940: The first commercial-aircraft market battle between Boeing and Douglas","As Dr. John D. Anderson describes in his book, The Airplane: A History of Its Technology, the decade of the 1930s brought the first design revolution to the mature, propeller-driven airplane. The decade saw advances in propulsion, with air-cooled radial engines; advances in structures, with streamlined metal airframes and retractable landing gear; improved airfield performance, with wing lift and -drag devices; and improved aircraft systems, providing better operational efficiency while improving crew and passenger safety. From this revolution came the introduction, in 1933, of the all-metal, streamlined Boeing Model 247, followed closely by the Douglas DC-1 and DC-2. The modern airliner was born. Clearly, no single person or organization invented the modern airliner. However, using Dr. Richard P. Hallion's model, “The Aerospace Design Process as a Way to Describe Emulations, Innovations and Inventions, this paper will examine the main people and technical events that influenced the Boeing and Douglas designs. Charles Lindbergh’s solo, transatlantic flight in May of 1927 had an immediate worldwide effect on the aviation industry. The flight stimulated that industry, bringing increased focus on research and development, and on newaircraft development, and it made major financial investment available to the aircraft manufacturers. The market demanded better commercial aircraft. The timing was then right for manufacturers to take risks and push the state of the art in their designs for new aircraft. Balancing the need to go farther, faster, and higher with the ability to carry more payload at optimum efficiency was the goal. The investment risk for these next-generation aircraft designs was motivated not just by a desire for return on investment, but also to ensure survival in the tough, competitive commercial air-transportation business for the foreseeable future. This paper is not a new history of the Boeing Model 247 or the Douglas DC-1/DC-2, but is intended to be a side-by-side case study that examines what aviation historians often call “The World’s First Modern Airliners.” The paper will focus on how the respective companies’ leadership approached their design, engineering, and manufacturing challenges in order to bring these two aircraft to the marketplace with a favorable, long-term competitive advantage. As history has shown in the case of Boeing’s Model 247, the Boeing approach did not have long-term success. The Douglas approach, by contrast, resulted in an iconic aircraft: the Douglas DC-3. This paper will investigate why the two companies’ design approaches differed. The paper will also examine the political, social, and operational requirements, as well as the personalities that drove the final configuration of both aircraft. In addition, the paper will review the role of government and the government regulations that helped to simulate aviation technology - and to create some unnecessary obstacles.",Lavelle M.,Conference Proceeding,54th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting,2016-01-01,,
"An integrated approach to automated synthesis, simulation and optimization of energy and signal-based design concepts","Computers have the capability to support human designers in a variety of tasks including releasing the human designer from routine tasks via design automation as well as sparking and supporting innovation and creativity. To support the concept phase effectively a wide range of possible concepts, which are quantitatively evaluated, should be considered to enable designers to explore the solution space and choose advantageous concepts. To enable automated solution space exploration and evaluation, this research presents a method that uses automated model transformations based on a graph-based object-oriented knowledge representation. The approach combines previous research with automated generation of variable assignments for generated concepts and optimization using simulated annealing. The variable assignments are generated by automatically setting up and solving constraint satisfaction problems and evaluated using automatically generated simulation models. The main contributions of this research are an integrated and fully automated approach starting with task definition and ending with a solution space of optimized product concepts and generic model transformations that enable automated use of Boolean satisfiability, constraint satisfaction and bond graph-based simulation methods. The method is validated on the case studies of automotive powertrains.",Münzer C.; Shea K.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference,2016-01-01,ETH Zürich,
Characterizing competencies for human-centered design,"Employees and employers alike increasingly value humancentered design, as it can drive innovation across a wide range of industries. With the growing interest in understanding human-centered design processes as they apply in different professions, there is a rising need to recognize the specific competencies necessary to perform these jobs well. Though there is a body of research on how people discover, create, and use design methods, there is a lack of understanding of what core competencies are necessary for people to apply these methods. Previous interactions with target users of the Design Exchange, an interactive community-driven portal to support design researchers and practitioners, have demonstrated a desire for increased awareness of the competencies required for employability and for successful design practice. This paper reports on a portion of an expansive competency-finding project aimed at identifying the core set of competencies that human-centered design practitioners need and employers seek. In this paper, we present our lists of cultivated mindsets, specialized disciplinary skills, contextualized tasks, and basic skills in human-centered design. These lists represent a first pass at identifying the essential and underlying competencies a practicing or aspiring human-centered designer must have in order to perform their current or future design tasks. The work we present in this paper serves as a preliminary starting point for future research interviews with design practitioners and employers, as we seek to understand human-centered design competencies.",Kramer J.; Agogino A.; Roschuni C.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference,2016-01-01,"Department of Mechanical Engineering;University of Maryland, College Park",
Application of bio-inspired design to minimize material diversity,"Bio-inspired design, or biomimicry, is an approach to innovation that takes nature's time-tested patterns, forms, functions, processes, and materials and uses them to develop engineering solutions. In this project we take inspiration from biological morphologies to develop new forms for semi-recyclable products. Biological systems exhibit multi-functionality from form, not necessarily material, which offers inspiration for product life-cycle management. The goal is to better understand the connection between form and function as found in nature to enable sustainable product design and enhance additive manufacturing processes. Through the application of bio-inspired design product recyclability is increased through minimization of material diversity while still achieving desired functions. One inspiring biological morphology that has been utilized across multiple biological kingdoms and in this research is variations in hardness and flexibility found in alternating layers that are used to provide strength, durability and protection. Another inspiring morphology considered in this research is the backbone of waterdiving birds, which consists of an intricately braided spine with parallel holes along each side. These holes allow for shock absorbance and force dispersion. These multi-function forms have resulted in the redesign of a semi-recyclable product fabricated using additive manufacturing to create a product that is made from a single material yet still achieves all necessary functions. Key contributions of this research include approaches for additive manufacturing strategies such as material utilization that align with a product's life cycle, thus increasing the recyclability of the product.",McCullar K.; Underhill S.; Rhodes P.; Nagel J.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference,2016-01-01,James Madison University,
Engineering Product and Process Design Changes: A Literature Overview,"Engineering product/process design changes are unavoidable and necessary for improvement & innovation. To capture the maximum market shares, manufacturers have to effectively and efficiently manage engineering changes throughout the entire product life.

Prediction of company's trend based on publication statistics and sentiment analysis,"This paper presents a method for predicting company's trend on research and technological innovation/ development(R&D) in business area. We used three types of data collections, i.e, scientific papers, open patents, and newspaper articles to estimate temporal changes of trends on company's business area. We used frequency counts on scientific papers and open patents to be published in time series. For news articles, we applied sentiment analysis to extract positive news reports related to the company's business areas, and count their frequencies. For each company, we then created temporal changes based on these frequency statistics. For each business area, we clustered these temporal changes. Finally, we estimated prediction models for each cluster. The results show that the the model obtained by combining three data is effective to predict company's future trends, especially the results show that SP clustering contributes overall performance.

A contribution for the analysis of pedagogical training for teaching in electrical engineering,"This paper contributes to the discussion of pedagogical training of engineering teachers based on a case study carried out in higher education institutions in Brazil, namely in Electrical Engineering. For this purpose, the authors chose to articulate two research methods: document analysis of the courses offered in the postgraduate programs (Master and PhD) in Electrical Engineering and a survey conducted with students and teachers from 58 of these postgraduate electrical engineering programs. The data analysis indicated that most of the teachers agreed that pedagogical training should be offered to engineering students. Postgraduate students also showed interest in enrolling courses with pedagogic focus. With this analysis we can state that there is a need to rethink engineering education, in order to create conditions for the development of competences related with teaching and learning innovation. This study shows the needs and presents some recommendations to deal with these issues in this field.",Cargnin-Stieler M.; Teixeira M.; Lima R.; Mesquita D.; Assunção E.,Journal,International Journal of Continuing Engineering Education and Life-Long Learning,2016-01-01,"Universidade do Estado de Mato Grosso;Universidade do Minho;Universidade Estadual Paulista ""Júlio de Mesquita Filho""",Electrical engineering education ;  Engineering education ;  Higher education ;  Pedagogical training ;  Teachers' professional development
"More time for the doing, having made the thinking 3D printing for knowledge circulation in healthcare","This paper investigates the phenomenon of the Digital Do-It-Yourself (Di-DIY) in the medical domain. In particular, the main contribution of the paper is a conceptual framework based on the notion of DiDIY in healthcare. To help focus on the main actors and assets composing the 3D printing innovation roles in healthcare we model: the DiDIY-er as the main initiator of the practice innovation; the available technology allowing the envisioning of new practices; the specific activities gaining benefits from the innovative techniques introduced; and the knowledge community continuously supporting and evolving knowledge practices. A general introduction on the notion of Knowledge Artifacts (KAs) and on the use of 3D printing (3DP) in medicine will be followed by our research questions and by a more detailed analysis of diagnostic, training and surgical planning activities for clinicians and patients. Observations carried out in a hospital in Italy are reported to exemplify activities based on 3DP bone models in the radiological and orthopaedic fields. These observations can be considered a second contribution of the paper, although secondary with respect to the conceptual framework. They also help proof how knowledge sharing and circulation in the community of healthcare professionals may be improved by the introduction of tangible and intangible KAs around the practice of DiDIY. Our framework is then presented in the end.",Cabitza F.; Locoro A.; Ravarini A.; Satta V.,Conference Proceeding,"IC3K 2016 - Proceedings of the 8th International Joint Conference on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management",2016-01-01,IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi;Università degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca;Università Carlo Cattaneo,Diagnostic ;  DiDIY ;  Knowledge Circulation in Healthcare ;  Medical 3D Printing ;  Training and Surgical Tools
Responsible Research and Innovation in Construction,"The issue of ethics and responsibility is gaining attention among the creators of scientific policy, funding agencies and society at large. Responsible research is defined as research that aligns both the process and the outcomes with the values, needs and expectations of society. In an EU funded project ""Responsible Research and Innovation in Information and Communication Technology (ICT)"" a four dimensional framework for defining and monitoring responsibility in that kind of research projects has been defined. The four dimensions are (1) actors who are responsible or to whom research is responsible, (2) kinds of responsibility - in what way are they responsible, (3) how much they are responsible and (4) in what area of ICT responsible research and innovation can take place. After presenting the framework we apply the concept of responsibility to research in the field of architecture, engineering and construction (AEC). We are finding that the particular feature that sets responsibility in construction apart from other research topics is the impact it has on life and safety of large number of people and on the critical infrastructures. While responsibility is important we conclude with a warning that the first responsibility of research is scientific quality and that other responsibilities cannot be a substitute for that.",Turk Ž.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Engineering,2016-01-01,Univerza v Ljubljani,construction research ;  innovation ;  research policy ;  responsibility ;  scientific method ;  social responsibility

Social innovation business models: Coping with antagonistic objectives and assets,"Purpose - The chapter provides empirical research results on the peculiarities of social innovation and the specific features that its business model must support. It concludes by proposing a Social Innovation Business Model Canvas and steps towards Social Innovation typologies. Methodology/approach - The research is based on the results of a comparative analysis of 25 business case studies and 32 biographies conducted within the SIMPACT research framework. We then implemented a process of reverse engineering to uncover the business models behind the cases which facilitated the creation of a typology for different social innovation business models. Reverse engineering is the application of tools and processes used to study new business ventures in comparison with existing ones. As such, it sheds further light on the broad characteristics of social business models and their value creation mechanisms. The evidence coming from the cases were analyzed within a new business model and clustered to identify a typology of business models of social innovations. Findings - The main SIMPACT findings, resulting from the reverse engineering process and upon which our discussion is based, can be seen in the following distinguishing characteristics of SI business models. SI business models are: configured around finding complementarity between antagonistic assets and seemingly conflicting logics; often structured around a divergence in the allocation of cost, use, and benefit leading to multiple value propositions; modeled on multiactor/multisided business strategies, and developed as frugal solutions and through actions of bricolage. Four typologies of social innovation were identified: beneficiary as actor, beneficiary as customer, beneficiary as user, and community-asset-based models. Research implications - While much attention has been placed on forprofit business models, there is little literature on social/not-for-profit business models. This chapter can add to this gap by providing substantial empirical evidence. Practical implications - Practitioners in the field of social innovation, particularly the growing intermediary sector, could integrate the findings of the research in their work. Social implications - The work is also leading to the construction of a future business toolbox for social innovation, which will be even more useful for incubators, accelerators, and supporting structures. Originality/value - Research presented in this chapter is the result of an extensive comparative analysis across all of Europe, including examples of failure, and the first to propose a typology of SI Business Models.",Komatsu T.; Deserti A.; Rizzo F.; Celi M.; Alijani S.,Book Series,"Critical Studies on Corporate Responsibility, Governance and Sustainability",2016-01-01,NEOMA Business School;Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna;Politecnico di Milano,Bricolage ;  Hybridity ;  Multisided business models ;  Social innovation

Profiling agricultural engineering technologies for mechanizing smallholder agriculture in Uganda,"Developing countries are grappling with numerous challenges including feeding rapidly growing populations, alleviating poverty, protecting the environment, and mitigating adverse impacts of climate change. For the coming years, one of the main agricultural development agenda for Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) should be to increase agricultural productivity and production to achieve food security through agricultural mechanization with Agricultural Engineering Technologies (AETs) as major inputs. However, there is paucity of information on the status of existing AETs and their contribution to mechanizing smallholder agriculture which is crucial to effective planning and strategy formulation. Therefore, the overarching objective of this paper is to review the past and present status, the constraints to adoption and future of AETs in Uganda in the context of mechanizing smallholder agriculture. Several proven AETs developed through research institutions and universities have been profiled in different areas of farm power and mechanization systems, agro-processing for value addition; renewable energy systems; and water harnessing and utilization. Availability and prudent use of these AETs along the value chain has the potential to enhance labor use and efficiency, provide greater precision and timeliness in farm operations, reduce postharvest loses, contributing to adding value to products and profitability of farming through proper handling, drying, cleaning, grading, processing, preservation, packaging and storage. The future of AETs in Uganda is hinged on addressing the aspects on appropriateness of the AETs in the smallholder agriculture context and standardizing of AET. Furthermore, human resource capacity development through enhancement of technical skills in AE, increased private sector engagement, economic incentives and innovation protection should be an integral part of the future strategies for development and increased adoption of AETs.",Wanyama J.; Banadda N.; Kiyimba F.; Okurut S.; Zziwa A.; Kabenge I.; Mutumba C.; Tumutegyereize P.; Komakech A.; Kiggundu N.,Journal,Agricultural Engineering International: CIGR Journal,2016-01-01,Makerere University;National Agricultural Research Organization,Agricultural engineering ;  Food security ;  Mechanization ;  Smallholder farmers
Ten challenges to have a sustainable financial system,"Purpose - This chapter outlines the need for a sustainable financial system in the wake and aftermath of the recent financial crises. Beginning with the widely accepted definitions of the financial system and the roles of the many participants in the system, we ask whether the financial system has lived up to expectations. Of particular interest is whether the financial system has fulfilled its obligations in the area of provision of credit, liquidity, and risk-management services. Methodology/approach - We review the Neoclassical Economics, the Institutional and the functional approaches to the design of a financial system with a view to understanding the recent lack of stability exhibited by the system. We identify the many financial innovations that have been proliferating in recent years due to advances and improvements in computer technology, valuation techniques, and financial engineering. We highlight the deleterious impact of the financialization of economies and excessive development of derivative markets. After defining financialization, we give specific examples of the nature and impact of cat-bonds, securitized subprime loans, and credit-default swaps and their role in the propagation of the recent financial crisis. Finally, we propose some courses of action to secure the global financial system. Findings - We identify ten challenges in achieving a sustainable financial system in the future and stress the need for all stakeholders to work to put the financial world in order and to restore confidence in the financial system. Research implications - Scholars and practitioners might take into account these dimensions in their courses and their behaviors. Practical/social implications - This approach participates to rebuild the financial system. The aim over the long term is to re-embed finance; we need to put finance with respect to both economy and society. Originality/value - Arguments in this chapter are straightforward; there are things that regulators are implementing; for others, nothing has been decided yet.

Experiences with ICME information infrastructures for applying materials models in sequence to give accurate macroscopic property prediction,"This paper draws on findings from the Material Data Management Consortium. The consortium, now in its 15th year, enables leading engineering enterprises (including among others GE, Boeing, Honeywell, Lockheed Martin, and NASA) to collaborate on best practice approaches to managing and applying critical materials information and technology with a key focus on traceable workflows for simulation and multi-scale modelling of materials, their processing and the resulting components. A key emphasis has been on verification and validation of macroscopic materials properties generated through sequentially-applied materials models; from ab-initio codes or models of microscopic unit cells through calculations at various length scales up to macroscopic properties. An example of this integration technology is described, using the MAC/GMC micromechanics code from NASA Glenn Research Center. Focus is given to the traceability of the simulated data and capture of sufficient metadata to ensure that the simulations can be recreated in future. The traditional method for understanding the effects of these different factors on materials innovation follows a set pattern where advantageous properties are pursued, iterating between process and structure while measuring the appropriate property. Progress relies on extensive and expensive physical testing campaigns, which generate vast quantities of highly complex data. There are hundreds of possible test types within materials engineering, all generating data of differing types, complexity, and different formats.",Marsden W.; Cebon D.; Arnold S.; Bednarcyk B.; Austin N.; Terentjev I.,Conference Proceeding,TMS Annual Meeting,2016-01-01,NASA Glenn Research Center;Granta Design Limited,ICME ;  MAC/GMC ;  Micromechanics ;  Simulation ;  Software ;  Workflow

An innovation monitoring method of vehicle induced aerodynamic load on sound barrier integrated with photogrammetry and image analysis,"Structural durability diseases of sound barrier erected on urban rapid viaduct have become more obvious with the disturbance effect of aerodynamic load induced by running vehicles. Primary reason lies in no enough consideration of vehicle-induced aerodynamic load (VIAL) action on sound barrier and its effect in the process of structural design, especially the absence of anti-fatigue design under VIAL. For sound barrier in service on urban rapid viaduct, under the action of VIAL, surface wind pressure on screen body and its vibration response can be easily collected by on-site wind pressure and acceleration acquisition system. Recent research demonstrates that VIAL on sound barrier depends on vehicle flow running characteristics directly, but there is almost no reference to introduce how to monitor the vehicle shape, speed and vehiclebarrier separation distance accurately. However, vehicle flow running characteristics is vital for research on sound barrier fatigue under the action of VIAL. In this paper, photogrammetry and image analysis has been brought into study of VIAL on sound barrier through an innovation monitoring method, that is to say, on-site multi-camera system is arranged to collect data of vehicle flow running characteristics, and wind pressure and acceleration acquisition system is also used at the same time. Specifically, running vehicles passed through the road test zone monitored with multi-camera system, and a serial of works were carried out in order to obtain data of vehicle shape, speed, and position, including camera calibration, stereo matching, threedimensional reconstruction and image recognition. And then, the numerical relationship among vehicle shape, speed, vehicle-barrier separation distance and VIAL on screen body and its vibration response is established with simultaneous measurement of screen surface wind pressure and acceleration data. In addition, according to some field test cases, results from numerical simulation analysis based on Computational Fluid Dynamics well match with field test data. The proposal monitoring method integrated with photogrammetry and image analysis is significant useful for fitting calculation formula of VIAL on sound barrier, further research combined with traffic flow prediction theory can be suitable for establishing the fatigue load spectrum of sound barrier under action of VIAL.",Wang D.; Pan Y.; Shen X.; Ma R.; Chen A.,Conference Proceeding,"Maintenance, Monitoring, Safety, Risk and Resilience of Bridges and Bridge Networks - Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Bridge Maintenance, Safety and Management, IABMAS 2016",2016-01-01,Tongji University,
Characterization of truck traffic in New Jersey based on 20-years of Weigh-In-Motion (WIM) data,"Over the past two decades, technological innovations in highway transportation industries and intermodalism in the freight industry reshaped the American transportation system. The State of New Jersey, located between two major metropolitan centers in the Northeast Region, Philadelphia and New York City, has a transportation system that carries high volumes of interstate traffic and products. Furthermore, traffic patterns in the State of New Jersey vary significantly from North to South and from rural to urban areas. The tremendous demand for transportation services today imposed significant impact on its infrastructures and highways. Thus, it is important to characterize the truck traffic in New Jersey and evaluate its impact on the critical infrastructure. There are a total of more than 90 permanent Weigh-in-Motion (WIM) sites operated by NJDOT. These WIM sites are spread across the State of New Jersey and located at different inter-state and state highways as well as local roads. In this study, the research is aimed at characterizing the truck traffic in New Jersey based on 20 years of truck weight data collected from these WIM sites. Twenty years of WIM data were processed using a customized computer program to separate regular truck traffic and over-weight truck traffic. The characteristics of truck traffic were studied according to classification, number of axles, regions, road types, regular or over-weight truck. In addition, various effects such as seasonal effects, variation during a day, weekday or weekend were also studied.",Su D.; Nassif H.,Conference Proceeding,"Maintenance, Monitoring, Safety, Risk and Resilience of Bridges and Bridge Networks - Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Bridge Maintenance, Safety and Management, IABMAS 2016",2016-01-01,Lamar University College of Engineering;Rutgers University–New Brunswick,
"Compliance with basic rules: The challenge of dialogical, enabling ans disciplinary management","Lying between two traditions of thought, one of which states that rules must always be respected (Weber, 1921), and the other that they can never be respected, this research suggests a third possibility, a contingent approach that distinguishes two types of rules: complex ones that cannot be scrupulously respected, and basic ones that are supposed to be strictly observed. Since the first type has been extensively studied, most of this article is devoted to basic rules and how they can be managed. In connection with collaborative management research carried out in a hospital in Île-de-France, we studied three activities: monitoring of peripheral venous catheters, sorting of healthcare waste and costing of hospital stays. After analysing breaches of basic rules for these activities, we propose corrective action of various kinds according to function, level of innovation and level of application. Regarding the latter, we have applied the recommendation of Reason (1997) which involves dealing with the problem of non-compliance with rules at three different levels: the organisational, engineering and individual levels. Whereas interventions carried out at the individual level have been widely discredited by studies of complex technological systems, our research shows their value when the relative simplicity of the situation makes it possible to formulate basic rules. Based on the observations made before and after implementing our proposed actions, we suggest adopting an approach to managing breaches of basic rules that we describe as dialogical, involving two complementary and antagonistic aspects: an enabling aspect and a disciplinary aspect.",Koenig G.; Vandangeon-Derumez I.; Marty M.; Auroy Y.; Dumond J.,Journal,Management (France),2016-01-01,Institut de Recherche en Gestion (IRG);Hôpital CoRe,
Learning Factories for the Operationalization of Sustainability Assessment Tools for Manufacturing: Bridging the Gap between Academia and Industry,"Sustainability assessment is recognized as a powerful decision support tool that promotes actions toward sustainable development, cultivates social learning and leads to a shift in sustainability knowledge and views. The Learning Factory as a new concept for both academic and industrial learning can help to operationalize assessment tools and close the gap between academia and industry.

An interval type-2 fuzzy ANP approach to evaluate enterprise technological innovation ability,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to overcome the drawbacks of analytic hierarchy process in solving complex decision-making problems, especially for the evaluation of enterprise technology innovation ability (ETIA). Because interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2 FSs) can handle uncertainty linguistic variables in a more flexible and precise way than type-1 fuzzy sets with their second fuzzy membership functions, a fuzzy ANP method with IT2 FSs is proposed to evaluate the ETIA. Design/methodology/approach: The criteria of evaluation on ETIA are identified and an evaluation model for ETIA is constructed on the basis of the application analysis of ETIA and theoretical design of ANP. In addition, two different ranking methods of IT2 FSs are applied in processing the relationships between influence factors of ETIA. Findings: By using the proposed interval type-2 fuzzy ANP (IT2 FANP) method, the efficiencies of the whole evaluation of ETIA can be measured and the important factors in the ETIA can also be determined. Compared with the type-1 FANP through the ranking results, the proposed IT2 FANP is more reasonable and robust for the evaluation of ETIA. Practical implications: The proposed IT2 FANP method is applied on the evaluation of ETIA. With respect to the application, the proposed method can be used to evaluate many more complex problems that contain feedback and circular relationships. Originality/value: The proposed IT2 FANP approach can solve the complexities and uncertainties at the same time. Considering the subjective initiative of decision-makers and the feedback between influence factors, the proposed method is more efficient than the existing type-1 approaches in the literature.",Wu T.; Liu X.,Journal,Kybernetes,2016-01-01,School of Economics & Management,ANP ;  Enterprise technology innovation ability ;  Interval type-2 fuzzy sets ;  Linguistic variables

Leonardo-Finmeccanica - Aircraft division needs for integrated systems engineering: The crystal user experience,"In the aerospace sector the products complexity clearly highlights the need to manage a wide variety of technologies in evolving and changeable scenarios. A way to successfully govern this multiplicity is by designing products thoughtfully integrated and ready to operate in scenarios that grow more and more entangled by the day. Fully embracing an integrated Systems Engineering (SE) approach is one way to untie this knot. Leonardo-Finmeccanica - Aircraft Division has been involved in different innovation initiatives aimed at promoting the use of Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) methodologies and tools integration as standard practices, in order to define an internal structured and robust Systems Engineering Process. The participation to the ARTEMIS CRYSTAL research project is part of these initiatives and is focused on validating innovative workflows and modeling approaches in a multi tool - multi user scenario. The definition of an appropriate Project Management environment and of a minimum set of Configuration Items to be properly managed starting from the Preliminary Design phase also represents a primary objective.

Theoretical reconstruction for welfare state democracy: 'Third way' sociology and the art of the possible,"Purpose-Theoretical reconstruction for the sake of practical political relevance is inherently resistant to the theorisation of a rigorous sociological discipline. Yet, the need for such theoretical reconstruction recurs in history, particularly in times of social and economic crisis when social reconstruction of damaged, fractured and conflict-ridden societies was seen as urgent by both applied sociologists and publics at large. Methodology/approach-This paper directs itself to questions regarding the intellectual and political origins of the Swedish, egalitarian, democratic welfare state ideology in the 1930s, and how it came to be theoretically defined in opposition to the overarching binary frameworks of 'conservative' capitalism and 'progressive' Marxist socialism. Re Findings-Using McLennan's notion of a 'vehicular' concept, I will attempt to show that the 'third' or 'middle way' compromise between opposing interests has, since its inception in the earlier parts of the twentieth century, changed over time, and will continue to change, within shifting political contexts and changing practical, political demands to 'move things on'. Practical implications-This paper also examines the concept of social planning-social engineering-as a 'third way' practical strategy and how it came to be used as a political and theoretical stick by which attack 'third way' democracy by both neo-liberal and Marxist theorists. Originality/value-The paper builds on the author's previous research on the intellectual and political visions of the Swedish social scientists and reformers, Alva and Gunnar Myrdal, and argues for the continuing importance of theoretical reconstruction and innovation in the preservation of justice and democracy.",Stina Lyon E.,Book Series,Current Perspectives in Social Theory,2016-01-01,,Democracy ;  Franz Oppenheimer ;  Gregor McLennan ;  Marxism ;  Third way ;  Welfare state

Commodity eats innovation for breakfast: A model for differentiating feature realization,"Once supporting the electrical and mechanical functionality, software today became the main competitive advantage in products. However, in the companies that we study, the way in which software features are developed still reflects the traditional ‘requirements over the wall’ approach. As a consequence, individual departments prioritize what they believe is the most important and are unable to identify which features are regularly used – ‘flow’, there to be bought – ‘wow’, differentiating and that add value to customers, or which are regarded commodity. In this paper, and based on case study research in three large software-intensive companies, we (1) provide empirical evidence that companies do not distinguish between different types of features, which causes poor allocation of R&D efforts and suppresses innovation, and (2) develop a model in which we depict the activities for differentiating and working with different types of features and stakeholders.",Fabijan A.; Olsson H.; Bosch J.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2016-01-01,Malmö Universitet;Chalmers University of Technology,Checkbox feature ;  Commodity ;  Customer feedback ;  Duty feature ;  Flow feature ;  Innovation ;  Wow feature
Advanced integrity management framework for Pipelines,"This paper describes the integrity management framework utilized within the Enbridge Liquids Pipelines Integrity Management Program. The role of the framework is to provide the high-level structure used by the company to prepare and demonstrate integrity safety decisions relative to mainline pipelines, and facility piping segments where applicable. The scope is directed to corrosion, cracking, and deformation threats and all variants within those broad categories. The basis for the framework centers on the use of a safety case to provide evidence that the risks affecting the system have been effectively mitigated. A 'safety case', for the purposes of this methodology is defined as a structured argument demonstrating that the evidence is sufficient to show that the system is safe. [1] The decision model brings together the aspects of data integration and determination of maintenance timing; execution of prevention, monitoring, and mitigation; confirmation that the execution has met reliability targets; application of additional steps if targets are not met; and then the collation of the results into an engineering assessment of the program effectiveness (safety case). Once the program is complete, continuous improvement is built into the next program through the incorporation of research and development solutions, lessons learned, and improvements to processes. On the basis of a wide range of experiences, investigations and research, it was concluded that there are combinations of monitoring and mitigation methods required in an integrity program to effectively manage integrity threats. A safety case approach ultimately provides the structure for measuring the effectiveness of integrity monitoring and mitigation efforts, and the methodology to assess whether a pipeline is sufficiently safe with targets for continuous improvement. Hence, the need for the safety case is to provide transparent, quantitative integrity program performance results which are continually improved upon through ongoing revalidations and improvement to the methods utilized. This enables risk reduction, better stakeholder awareness, focused innovation, opportunities for industry information sharing along with other benefits.",Le Blanc L.; Kresic W.; Keane S.; Munro J.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the Biennial International Pipeline Conference, IPC",2016-01-01,Enbridge Inc.,
Relational capabilities to leverage new knowledge: Managing directors’ perceptions in UK and Portugal old industrial regions,"Purpose: Focusing on the specific context of two European old industrial regions – South Yorkshire (UK) and North Region of Portugal – this paper aims to identify and conceptualise a set of relational capabilities that business leaders perceive to play a key role in industrial rejuvenation. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative research design operationalised via case studies was followed for the empirical analysis. Data collection was developed through in-depth interviews with managing directors in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) belonging to the metal and engineering industry and the textile and footwear sectors in the two old industrial regions. Data analysis followed the techniques of data categorisation, within case-analysis and cross-case analysis. Findings: The study identifies relational capabilities that firms use to identify, access and leverage new knowledge: frequent meetings with customers; frequent meetings with suppliers; dialogue with government to influence policy that encourages research and technology transfer; partnership actions for the commercialisation of products and services; active membership with sector associations; immersion in science and technological parks; intentionally establishing links with entrepreneurship-supporting entities; human resources development by technical training institutions; and systematic links with the University. The relational capabilities identified require structured communication processes and alliance management practices to enable and support absorptive capacity and learning in inter-organisational networks. Practical implications: The relational capabilities identified can help position regions in specific markets and value chains, contribute to improving regions’ internal and external connections and assist in combining regions’ strengths to create industrial capability in high-growth-potential areas. Originality/value: This paper highlights the role of relational capabilities as a way to secure access to knowledge and competencies needed for firms’ innovation and avoidance of competency traps. This is particularly relevant in the context of European smart specialisation policy, where key regional stakeholders collectively engage in the identification of areas of competitive strength, enhanced coordination and strategic alignment of resources. The study is not without limitations, as findings are based on case studies of SMEs operating in the manufacturing industry and the analysis of relational capabilities is focused on knowledge novelty.",Martins J.,Journal,Learning Organization,2016-01-01,The University of Sheffield,Absorptive capacity ;  Industrial rejuvenation ;  Knowledge management ;  Old industrial regions ;  Relational capabilities
Ontology forecasting in scientific literature: Semantic concepts prediction based on innovation-adoption priors,"The ontology engineering research community has focused for many years on supporting the creation, development and evolution of ontologies. Ontology forecasting, which aims at predicting semantic changes in an ontology, represents instead a new challenge. In this paper, we want to give a contribution to this novel endeavour by focusing on the task of forecasting semantic concepts in the research domain. Indeed, ontologies representing scientific disciplines contain only research topics that are already popular enough to be selected by human experts or automatic algorithms. They are thus unfit to support tasks which require the ability of describing and exploring the forefront of research, such as trend detection and horizon scanning. We address this issue by introducing the Semantic Innovation Forecast (SIF) model, which predicts new concepts of an ontology at time t + 1, using only data available at time t. Our approach relies on lexical innovation and adoption information extracted from historical data. We evaluated the SIF model on a very large dataset consisting of over one million scientific papers belonging to the Computer Science domain: the outcomes show that the proposed approach offers a competitive boost in mean average precision-at-ten compared to the baselines when forecasting over 5 years.",Cano-Basave A.; Osborne F.; Salatino A.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2016-01-01,Aston Business School;The Open University,Adoption priors ;  Innovation priors ;  Latent semantics ;  LDA ;  Ontology evolution ;  Ontology forecasting ;  Scholarly data ;  Topic evolution
Safety level on different offshore pipeline design criteria: A comparison between dnv-os-f101 and api rp-1111 codes,"Submarine pipelines are more often than before required to operate in harsh environments, especially for systems deployed in ultra-deep water. In order to minimize the installation tension due to the hanged section, they are installed empty and therefore the external pressure is often the prime load parameter for the design. New discoveries and associated technical challenges have generated important research and development endeavors in a wide range of disciplines in order to improve efficiency and reliability, but also keeping the risks associated with the new scenarios within an acceptable range. Some aspects that can be mentioned include, for instance, steel line grade improvements and manufacturing innovations of pipe products; more powerful lay vessels and development of new pipeline installation methods; determination of the mechanical behavior and the expected failure modes of concern for deep and long pipelines under combined loads; and the improved different design criteria like the DNV-OS-F101 (1) and API RP-1111 (2) codes. The intention of this paper is to review and compare three different pipeline design criteria well established in the oil and gas industry. The pipeline wall thickness design for pipe pressure containment (bursting), local buckling (system collapse) and propagating buckling for DNV-OS-F101 (1) and API RP-1111 (2) are discussed as well as the parameters used, definitions, safety philosophy and code limitations.

The tacit knowledge capacity of lecturers: A cross-country comparison,"The importance of universities as knowledge hubs is increasing due to knowledge production via research and teaching. An emerging aspect of knowledge management literature is the study of the knowledge requirements of universities. In particular, the transformation from knowledge creation to knowledge sharing has proved to be important in the university context and is subject to cultural differences. For example, previous research has indicated that a physician's Tacit Knowledge Capacity (TKC) is affected by social software and social media. This creates opportunities to carry out new research on different occupations that have an intense TKC. As part of this research, a survey was conducted in order to assess the TKC of lecturers in both Germany and North Cyprus. These are two countries that provide knowledge management programmes. The research will determine the TKC in both countries and compare the two in order to determine if cultural factors affect the TKC of the profession. Through this research, the authors aim to contribute to the ongoing research on the knowledge requirements of universities that will enable them to be knowledge intensive institutions. The Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences at Near East University, which has 2,200 students and 20 lecturers, was compared with the Faculty of Business and Economics at the Dresden University of Technology, which has 2,800 students and 25 lecturers. Further research was carried out to provide an intercultural comparison, which is currently lacking in the Knowledge Management field. The research findings have highlighted that the Speed of Adaption to Innovation positively affects the Tacit Knowledge Capacity of lecturers. Lecturers also need to pay attention to the social media they use as it can increase their Tacit Knowledge Accumulation and also may enable effective communication and knowledge transfer with students.",Kaya T.; Erkut B.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Knowledge Management, ECKM",2016-01-01,Technische Universität Dresden;Yakın Doğu Üniversitesi,Knowledge accumulation ;  Knowledge transfer ;  Tacit knowledge ;  Tacit knowledge capacity
Early success for pipeline safety research with universities,"In 2013, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) implemented a new cooperative agreement program entitled the Competitive Academic Agreement Program (CAAP). The CAAP initially was modeled after similar existing private and public sector based university programs where students themselves competed to participate in a limited number of publicized student intern programs. After just three years, CAAP is breathing further innovation into PHMSA's pipeline safety research endeavors. One difference between CAAP and the traditional university student research model is that the professors directing students under CAAP have control over the number and educational level of the students entering into the program. This promotes a ""Team Approach,"" which today's pipeline industry sees as an added value when interviewing potential job applicants. The CAAP is intended to spur innovation through enabling an academic research focus on high risk and high payoff solutions for wide ranging pipeline safety challenges. The CAAP is different in focus, execution and reporting than PHMSA's core program on Pipeline Safety Research. It is intended to potentially deliver desired technical or scientific/quantitative solutions that can be ""handed-off"" for further investigations in future year CAAP applications or used in PHMSA's core Research, Development and Demonstration (RD&D) program, which employs partnerships with a variety of public/private organizations. Another goal for CAAP is to expose undergraduate, MS and PhD research students to subject matter related to their educational area of focus, while addressing pipeline safety challenges. This approach is illustrating how their engineering or technical discipline is highly desired and needed across the pipeline field. The pipeline industry and federal/state regulators are all experiencing low numbers of entry level applications to positions that are engineering or technically focused. Public conferences, meetings and journals have identified similar shortfalls. This paper will describe the level of CAAP investment and focus areas to date; illustrate how efforts to expose student research to industry enhances employment opportunities; and comment on where promising innovations are coming from due to these research endeavors.",Merritt J.; Smith R.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the Biennial International Pipeline Conference, IPC",2016-01-01,U.S. Department of Transportation,

Which knowledge becomes a spin-off? An exploratory survey on Italian context,"The spin-offs are the result of third academic revolution and the primary means of research exploitation becoming the primary mechanism for knowledge transfer from Universities and other Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to firms. Nowadays the University plays a central role in the process of innovation and supporting the industrial system. On this basis, the paper aims to analyze which knowledge can create spin-off. In particular, the explanatory work after the analysis of the current state of the spin-offin Italy and their main features, it proposes to highlight the relationships between universities' knowledge and knowledge used in the spin-off. The methodology used forthis study is ideally divided into three parts. In the first step, an analysis was made on the literature of knowledge transfer and spin-offs. In the second step, through an empirical analysis that took in consideration no. 1,384 spin-offs, was highlighted the main critical features of the spin-offin Italian Universities and other Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). In the third step, the analysis has pointed out the policies of knowledge transfer that the Italian Universities and HEIs adopted for the creation of spin-offs and the principal results obtained. The main element of originality of this work is to provide one in-depth study of the mechanisms of knowledge transfer from Italian Universities to the context, with particular focus on spin-offway. In particular, the study takes into account all the spin-offs recognized by Italian Universities and compares them with policies of new enterprises' creation. The paper wants to offer the first considerations on the characteristics of the spin-offin Italy, highlighting the relationship between knowledge and spin-offs and what type of knowledge was useful to create spin-offs. The study is to be inserted in the field of research related to the analysis of institutional factors of knowledge transfer and their impact on the relationship between Universities and Industry, by trying to offer the first results and first insights of knowledge transfer policies used by Italian Universities.",Vesperi W.; Reina R.; Gentile T.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Knowledge Management, ECKM",2016-01-01,Università degli studi Magna Graecia di Catanzaro;Università degli Studi di Messina,Academic spin-offs ;  Knowledge organization ;  Knowledge transfer ;  University spin-off
Teachers' intention to use educational video games: A technology acceptance model approach,"Educational video games are gaining momentum as a means to increase students' attention on the learning materials but also as a way to engage students in their learning process. Despite the opportunities that educational video games offer to education, previous research found that teachers might experience challenges, fears, and barriers when using technological innovations (e.g. computers) in the classroom. Because educational video games are a technological innovation, teachers might face barriers that dissuade them from using educational video games in their courses. Analysing teachers' drivers and barriers related to the use of educational video games is a key factor related to the failure or success when trying to implement educational video games in the classroom. This study analyses teachers' intention to use educational video games in their courses using a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) approach. TAM was developed to predict an individual's likelihood to accept a technological innovation and it has been applied in a wide range of technological developments such as mobile phones and social media. In the last years, TAM has also been applied to different educational contexts such as online education and mobile learning. One of the main goals of TAM was to identify the major motivational variables that mediate between system characteristics and the actual use of the system. Using a sample of 312 higher education institutions' teachers, we analyse perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of educational video games through structural equation modelling to predict teachers' behavioural intentions. Results suggest that perceived usefulness influences in a direct and positive way teachers' intention to use educational video games. Results also suggest that perceived ease of use indirectly influence intentions through perceived usefulness. Regarding managerial implications, our findings highlight the importance of specific teacher training programs about this technological innovation so that teachers realise the usefulness of educational video games rather than focusing on the level of easiness. Limitations of the study and future research lines are also addressed.",Martí-Parreño J.; Sánchez-Mena A.; Aldás-Manzano J.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the European Conference on Games-based Learning,2016-01-01,Universidad Europea de Valencia;Universitat de València,Attitude ;  Educational Video Games ;  Higher Education ;  TAM (Technology Acceptance Model) ;  Teacher's role

Knowledge management as change agent to ensure the sustainability of emerging knowledge organizations,"Abstract: Few researchers addressed the link between information technology and knowledge transfer, and even fewer the relationships between motivational leadership and knowledge management. While it is realised in the literature that it might be a little problematic to implement knowledge management as a change agent during organizational change, it is argued that it can be used by what is today referred to as knowledge leaders, to manage not only knowledge creation, storing and codification, but also knowledge sharing to enhance the learning culture of emerging knowledge organizations. The commonality of most recent research indicates an emphasised focus on knowledge management (technical, human and communication components), and it is argued that knowledge leaders should implement strategic integrated communication to ensure the sustainability of knowledge organizations. These knowledge leaders should be able to: empower individuals to respond creatively to changing situations; adopt personal and active attitudes, individual and organizational goals; contribute to resonant leadership practices; should be self- and socially aware of emotions and goals; be equipped with skills such as self- and relationship management which is characterised by transparency, adaptability, collaboration and motivation; and should be associated with a supportive organizational climate due to a constructive organizational culture with the aim to inspire people to learn. Where knowledge management focuses on two main theoretical perspectives, namely human capital and knowledge based theory, the theory of strategic integrated communication emphasises that knowledge leaders should acknowledge the premises of the strategic intent of the organization by managing information through, inter alia, motivation, innovation and creativity. The research problem is that in spite of the tremendous research opportunities to examine these constructs, limited research has been conducted from emerging knowledge organization perspectives, especially during change and transformation. This study addressed this gap to enhance the field's discussion with the main aim to critically review existing literature based on an interpretivistic approach from a predominantly postmodern perspective. Hence a theoretical framework has been developed to indicate the interrelationship of these concepts which should be considered by emerging knowledge organizations in future to ensure sustainable stakeholder relationships.",Barker R.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Knowledge Management, ECKM",2016-01-01,University of South Africa,Change and transformation ;  Emerging knowledge organizations ;  Knowledge creation and sharing ;  Knowledge leaders ;  Knowledge management ;  Strategic integrated communication ;  Sustainable stakeholder relationships
What on earth is responsible innovation anyway? (and how to make it happen),"The case for Responsible Innovation has been well articulated in the areas of science research and Corporate Social Responsibility in business. This paper presents a case for adopting a design-led approach in order to promote responsibility in innovation. It uses a case-study review of ten years of innovation projects to explore the similarities and differences between approaches to Social Innovation and Commercial Innovation in order explore the values of design-led Responsible Innovation across these contexts. The research draws upon industry expertise, Masters projects and theoretical models. In particular it relates the attributes of the design-led approach to the four dimensions model proposed by Stilgoe et al. [6]. It concludes by proposing a framework that draws upon notions of Deep Empathy as proposed by Michlewski [3], Dynamic Mapping, Consequence Visioning and Toggling between micro and macro views.",Bailey M.; Sams P.; Spencer N.; Bentham A.; Bayliss B.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Design Education: Collaboration and Cross-Disciplinarity, E and PDE 2016",2016-01-01,Royal Academy of Engineering;University of Northumbria,Design-led ;  Multidisciplinary innovation ;  Responsible innovation
The emergence of a new material culture: Forging unprecedented alliances between design and engineering,"This paper addresses a creative multidisciplinary project relevant to making programmable textile called Flexible Textile Structures through the lens of bio-inspired design, with the goal of fostering innovation and excellence in rapid prototyping and additive manufacturing. Flexible Textile Structures explored the reciprocal relationships among design, science, and technology across scales and appraised a wide range of aspects from visualization, fabrication, material ecology, architecture, to interaction and performance. Here, the focus was on conducting a clear line of design research in a school of design that supports creativity while also addressing the relationships between the new generation of textile developments and their shaping processes in the production of form through ""form finding"" exercises in 3D printing.",Borhani A.; Kalantar N.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Design Education: Collaboration and Cross-Disciplinarity, E and PDE 2016",2016-01-01,Texas A&M University,Additive manufacturing ;  Flexible textile structure ;  Multidisciplinary ;  Programmable material
Triple-loop-learning: An instrumentation model for engineering design innovation education,"This paper presents a framework for engineering design innovation education. This is discovery research in a purely qualitative sense. The authors, both highly experienced educators, are reflecting upon their practice of delivering team-based new product development courses at the master's degree level at deeply different universities in Sweden and the United States of America. In both cases, industry partners bring real-world projects and funding to the curricula. They have, as their primary objective, the development of talented new product development leaders. In both cases there is no intellectual property attachment to the funding. This paper seeks to make important distinctions about common language and practices within different regional and academic cultures. We are hopeful that our observations and the presented framework will draw others to deepen our understanding through next generation quantitative studies.",Berglund A.; Leifer L.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Design Education: Collaboration and Cross-Disciplinarity, E and PDE 2016",2016-01-01,Stanford University;The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH),Course instrumentation ;  Innovation ;  Learning elements ;  Project-based learning
Comparative analysis of industrial design methodologies for fixed-bottom and floating wind turbines,"The floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) market is currently dominated by single unit demonstration projects and first pre-commercial wind farms such as the Hywind Scotland wind farm. Today's FOWT substructure design process is therefore not yet at a level of industrialization comparable to fixed-bottom substructure design methodologies, where standardized design and realization procedures are well established throughout the industry. Aligned with work performed in the Ramboll and University of Stuttgart-led work packages ""Concept Industrialization"" and ""Design practice"" of the European H2020 LIFES50+ project, the ambition of this paper is to define state-of-the-art fixed-bottom and floating design methods and based on these identify key differences through comparative analysis. In the first part of the paper the scope and selected details of today's industrialized design process for fixed-bottom substructure design is presented, including e.g. load iteration schemes and applied numerical methods, risk assessment incorporation, optimization, and cost modelling. In the second part, the key elements of this industrialized procedure which are different to FOWT design are identified and described: This is done based on a review of the current FOWT common design practice, where elements are identified that are unique and/or different for FOWTs ? this includes e.g. the requirement to adapt the controller to the specific platform behaviour, as well as a tower and/or selected rotor-nacelle assembly (RNA) component redesign, and also includes differences in terms of defining and performing load case simulations. Another observation that is described relates to the floating specific required numerical methodologies applied for the detailed structural and mooring design, where challenges exist regarding the interface between coupled global loads analyses tools and detailed structural, mooring, and geotechnical tools. A further key item discussed in this respect is the industry-common load exchange practice for fixed-bottom design, where only a limited data exchange between WT manufacturers and platform designers is done; a procedure that is challenging to be applied for FOWTs. Compared with fixed-bottom design, the consideration of manufacturability, fabrication constraints, serial production, design complexity reduction, assembly, supply chain, installation, geotechnics, O&M and risk is often limited and these items will also be briefly discussed. Overall the paper is intended as a technical review of existing fixed-bottom design procedures and, facilitated through the comparative analysis with these established design methodologies, identifies and presents the key differentiating design elements and challenges for an industrialized FOWT design. The content of the paper will provide input for the focused development of design processes for industrialized detailed design of FOWTs to guarantee the demanded technology-readiness and manufacturing-readiness levels (TRL and MRL) and ultimately improve their CAPEX and OPEX by applying industrial design procedures.

The adoption process and impact of additive manufacturing on manufacturing systems,"Purpose - Company pressure for manufacturers is mounting from two angles: Increasing pressure of global competition, and rapid advancements in technology such as additive manufacturing (AM) that are altering the way that goods are manufactured. The purpose of this paper is to explore the adoption process of AM within a manufacturing system and its business impact. Design/methodology/approach - Research was conducted to collect empirical data at two manufacturing case companies in the North West England. Both cases are located in areas of industrial recovery using AM engineering innovation for value creation. Findings - Early findings showed that the implementation of AM caused a shift in value propositions and the creation of additional value streams (VSs) for the case study companies. AM was shown to compliment and strengthen traditional manufacturing VSs rather than replacing them. Research limitations/implications - Limitations include the generalizability due to the number and location of case companies included in this research. Practical implications - It is worthwhile to explore the opportunities that AM brings with the existing customer base as it has the potential to add unexplored and untapped value. However, managers need to be mindful of the capability and resources required to put the VS into practice. Social implications - Both cases resulted in skill retainment and development due to the implementation of AM. Hence, the innovation contributed to regional economic recovery and business survival. Originality/value - This empirical research is one of the early field explorations focussing on the impact of AM on VS structures. Hence, this paper contributes to the area of technology enhanced manufacturing systems.",Rylands B.; Böhme T.; Gorkin R.; Fan J.; Birtchnell T.,Journal,Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management,2016-01-01,"Sydney Business School, University of Wollongong;University of Wollongong",3D printing ;  Additive manufacturing ;  Innovation ;  Supply chains ;  Value stream
Open organization in engineering design,"Organizations face various challenges caused by social and economic change. Particular problems are the demographical change and thus the lack of skilled labour and changed employee needs. An approach to face these challenges is the idea to open up organizational boundaries and adjust them towards the organization's environment. This paper clarifies this Open Organization approach with background in the field of product development. The goal of this contribution is to introduce the concept of Open Organization into the product development domain by specifying our understanding of Open Organization. Therefore existing definitions and descriptions from literature are analysed. Within this topic our research focuses on two opening dimensions of an organization: Knowledge and persons. Both can be commonly used or shared over existing organizational boundaries. Accordingly, a classification of opening types is presented. A main finding of our research is that 'open' is not merely a status to describe organizations - instead, the opening of an organization is a process that requires constant adjustments and negotiations. This paper contributes an approach to support the opening process of companies with focus on the development process. Open Organization extends the idea of Open Innovation by adding the exchange of individuals as knowledge carriers to the exchange of knowledge. This approach consists of a set of developed methods, strategies and tools.",Dominik W.; Martin B.; Sabine P.; Udo L.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of NordDesign, NordDesign 2016",2016-01-01,Technische Universität München;Universität Hohenheim,Collaboration ;  Open Organization ;  Organizational boundaries ;  Product development
"Material innovation: Case studies of tangible working material in technology, art and design","There are still unexplored entrepreneurial potentials for collaboration in design, art and engineering. Heimdal and Rosenquist explored three roles of textiles as tangible working materials in such co-design processes. However, more knowledge of innovative design processes that involve new use of materials is needed. The aim of this study was to identify potentials for sustainable innovation in tangible working materials in design processes. This was analysed in a 'preservation of diverse cultures' perspective from Deep Ecology. Case studies were performed on the design and engineering of innovative use of materials for product development and design of the environment. Contexts for the case studies included cement industries, experimental use of cement in design education, 3D printing of plasterbased, clay-based and cement-based composites, public art in a terrazzo floor in a school and concrete art sculptures in a hospital park. The findings were discussed in relation to ecology to contribute to concepts for sustainable collaborative practices between technology, art and design.",Berg A.; Rodrigues O.; Haugen S.; Puhkan U.; Stoltenberg E.; Wettre M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of NordDesign, NordDesign 2016",2016-01-01,"Estonian Academy of Arts;OsloMet – StorbyUniversitetet;Universidade Estadual Paulista ""Júlio de Mesquita Filho""",Artistic research ;  Chemical products ;  Deep Ecology ;  Participatory design
Product lifecycle management - How to adapt PLM to support changing product development processes in industry?,"Product development as a collaborative process which requires the contribution of multiple engineering disciplines within a design department and cross the enterprise network. In industrial practice, more and more companies are facing the need of a transformation from a pure part or component manufacturer to a system provider. At the same time products - parts, components and systems - are shifting from pure mechanical design to a systems design, including electric/electronic and software. Together with trends mainly known as Internet of Things, Industrial Internet or Industry 4.0 the industrial market requires a higher level of interoperability of designed products to be addressed by the product development process. Product Lifecycle Management (PLM), a concept to manage product-related engineering data cross all phases of the product lifecycle, needs to adapt to be able to support these various emerging facets of the product development process. This paper will discuss from an industry perspective what can be leveraged from two other well-known concepts and approaches to support the evolution of PLM: Firstly, Systems Engineering as a concept to support complex product design cross engineering disciplines; and secondly Technology Management as a concept to support product innovation. Both concepts are well-established from a research point of view, but often implemented isolated within industrial companies. Implementing both concepts in companies not only as methods, but also in terms of processes and respective organization, can provide a big potential to cross-benefit PLM. PLM as a combination of processes, methods, tools and respective organizations is focusing on the ability to manage product information and provides a defined set of capabilities to a company. At the same time these capabilities can be the prerequisites for a company to establish concepts in product design or innovation management. The paper, as part of a series of research work, will elaborate on the challenges product development is currently facing, formulate requirements to PLM emerging therefrom, and propose an approach for evolving PLM developed based on an industrial client example.",Bitzer M.; Vielhaber M.; Kaspar J.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of NordDesign, NordDesign 2016",2016-01-01,Universität des Saarlandes;Accenture,Cross engineering discipline ;  PLM ;  Product design process ;  Systems engineering ;  Technology management
Experimental studies in design science and engineering design science - A repository for experiment setups,"This paper answers the design science's call for the systematical implementation of research methodology in order to empirically study the principles, practices and procedures of design. As a research methodology, experiments depend on robust study designs that quantify selected dependent variables, independent of time, location, or conducting researcher. However, it has been shown, that experimental science struggles with the repeatability of experiments, as context and participants introduce many unexpected independent and dependent variables to what is otherwise a robust experimental protocol. Crucially, the lack of detailed information in the description of the experimental setup may prevent the fellow researcher to comprehend data outcome along with corresponding cause-effect interpretation and, moreover, may lead to contradicting results when conducting confirmatory studies and/or meta-analyzes. Grounded in the positive sciences, we strive to minimize this hurdle and present the concept of the experimental item-mining repository, targeting to generate a standardized document with detailed information about the experiment. This repository can potentially become mandatory for certain types of journals in the field, so that any published study is properly documented and does not jeopardize the foundations of science. The level of detail required for a successful submission in the repository is very high: from environmental influences, such as noise and temperature, to detailed plans of the rooms, and lists of hardware and software - incl. version number - involved. Along with a call for open source science and the necessity of detailed empirical information, we provide and present the concept of this online repository by providing a design observation example from our own studies. A later version might be incorporated into a new CERN IdeaSquare Journal of Experimental Innovation (CIJ).",Kriesi C.; Balters S.; Steinert M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of NordDesign, NordDesign 2016",2016-01-01,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Design science methodology ;  Experiment information ;  Open source science ;  Repeatability ;  Repository
A capabilities approach to innovation: A case study of a technology and innovation hub in Zambia,"This paper critically examines the linear claim, often made, that innovation leads to development. The orthodox view embedded in this claim, which equates development with industrial development and economic growth, is problematized in this paper partly by counter posing this orthodox concept of economic growth with Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum's heterodox conceptualisation of human development, which advances a comprehensive view of development that requires evaluation not only of income and wealth, but also of other aspects of well-being and agency that people have reason to value. This research uses interpretive research methods including semi-structured interviews and participant observation to gain insight into technology and innovation hub dynamics. Findings include that those working at tech hubs value belonging to a community of shared interest and contributing to social enterprises. We argue that tech hubs, as collaborative spaces, may contribute to human-centred development processes in ways not directly leading to employment or market-based innovative products.",Jimenez A.; Zheng Y.,Conference Proceeding,"24th European Conference on Information Systems, ECIS 2016",2016-01-01,"Royal Holloway, University of London",Capabilities approach ;  Development ;  Innovation ;  Tech hubs
Business model transformation patterns of data-driven innovations,"Driven by advances in information and communication technologies (ICT), manifold business opportunities emerge in diverse industries. In this development, data plays an important role as an essential element of change and economic growth. As a consequence of this development, the analysis of service business models and the role of data in these models has become a focus of interest in practice and research. This paper focuses on international companies that implemented successfully data-driven innovations and aims, in particular, at the analysis of the effects of data-driven innovation on companies' business models. Based on a multiple case study method, this paper proposes four different transformation patterns: (1) cooperative value innovation, (2) customer-centric value innovation, (3) cooperative productivity improvement, and (4) company-centric productivity improvement. These patterns show that data-driven innovations enable a transformation from product to service-oriented offerings. Furthermore, an optimization of internal and external processes and thus, of the productivity is possible.",Zolnowski A.; Christiansen T.; Gudat J.,Conference Proceeding,"24th European Conference on Information Systems, ECIS 2016",2016-01-01,Universität Hamburg;Capgemini Deutschland GmbH,Case study ;  Data-driven business models ;  Service ;  Transformation pattern
Reverse human factors - Why we adapt to processes and objects that are counter-intuitive and detrimental to human health and comfort,"Human Factors in Industrial Design has primarily focused on the development of ergonomic and user-friendly products that are shaped to fit human behaviour and human dimensions. In contrast, this paper focuses on how human beings are impacted by using the products that humans have designed. It demonstrates how products with apparently poor and inadequate Human Factor qualities develop and change our behaviour. The paper shows that through this process and these changes, we develop new ideas and new ways of perceiving ourselves in concert with our interaction with the product (""Reverse Human Factors""). Iconic consumer electronics and a number of other products are studied from this perspective. The case studies of Reverse Human Factors point to certain generic traits that should be recognized as drivers of innovation.",Jensen A.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings - D and E 2016: 10th International Conference on Design and Emotion - Celebration and Contemplation,2016-01-01,Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,Consumer electronics ;  Human factor ;  Innovation

Advances in small satellite technology and resilient space systems,"With the changing security and fiscal environment in space, there is a need for new and innovative approaches to provide resilient space systems. In order to organize various resilience concepts and ideas, the U.S. DoD released the Space Mission Assurance: A Resilience Taxonomy whitepaper, and in it, the paper identifies six approaches to improve the resilience of space systems, which are disaggregation, diversification, distribution, proliferation, deception, and protection. Meanwhile, the creation of the CubeSat bus form factor, which was originally developed for academia and research, has led to a surge of new commercial space companies and civil and military government missions and programs. The rapid pace of innovation and maturation of technology for CubeSats and small satellites over the past ten years are enabling advanced missions and new concepts of operations. For the foreseeable future, the use of large satellites will continue, while small satellite applications will increase, and opportunities exist where both platforms can be used synergistically to bolster the resilience of space systems. This paper provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art in small satellite technology, a discussion on resilience and how that applies to small satellites, and a list of small satellite architecture concepts that have the potential of contributing to space system resilience.",Iwata C.; Venturini C.,Conference Proceeding,"AIAA Space and Astronautics Forum and Exposition, SPACE 2016",2016-01-01,"Aerospace Corporation, USA",
What does neighborhood theory mean for ecourbanism? Introduction to the themed issue on ‘Ecourbanism Worldwide’,"A growing chorus of planners and designers heralds the neighborhood as the best scale at which to pursue a shift toward low-carbon, “green” living alternatives to the status quo Western lifestyle. Within this, attention to ecourban developments, as a set of planning, design, social and technological arrangements for living better within resource limits, has increased; ecourban neighborhood scale developments, as well as the certification frameworks seeking to imbue them with legitimacy, can be found in different countries worldwide. They hold potential lessons for one another across environmental, design and engineering perspectives while also serving as catalysts and demonstration projects of planning, policy and design for sustainability in their local contexts. They offer new opportunities for learning about living well. This is not to say that the rolling out of ecourban neighborhoods in different contexts around the world does not engender tensions. Models, frameworks and practices of ecourbanism may carry divergent interpretations of sustainability and hence advance, to varying degrees, different priorities. These divergences can be seen, for example, across livability, environmental, social and economic priorities. Similar tensions also occur on the issue of scale, with ecourban developments taking form as urban redevelopment megaprojects, technological innovation demonstration projects, smaller-scale alternative lifestyle projects, and other scales in between. This special issue of Articulo - Journal of Urban Research advances the exploration of current trends in ecourban neighborhood-scale developments, including the tensions that they raise. This introduction to the special issue provides a summary of the literature on ecourbanism and the importance of the ‘neighborhood scale’, a synopsis of the Ecourbanism Worldwide project, and provides a brief introduction to the scholarly work included in this special issue.",Sturgeon D.; Holden M.; Molina A.,Journal,Articulo - Journal of Urban Research,2016-01-01,Simon Fraser University,Ecocities ;  Ecourbanism ;  Green buildings ;  Neighborhoods ;  Sustainable development
Recent achievements and challenges in farm animal biotechnology (10th anniversary scientific conference with international participation - Analytical review),"10th All-Russian scientific conference and school «Recent achievements and challenges in farm animals biotechnology - BioTechZh-2015» (http://www.vij.ru/index.php/ru/konferentsii/) was held on December 8-11, 2015 at the L.K.

Carbon Capture and Storage: Concluding remarks,"This paper aims to pull together the main points, messages and underlying themes to emerge from the Discussion. It sets these remarks in the context of where Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) fits into the spectrum of carbon mitigation solutions required to meet the challenging greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets set by the COP21 climate change conference. The Discussion focused almost entirely on carbon capture (21 out of 23 papers) and covered all the main technology contenders for this except biological processes. It included (chemical) scientists and engineers in equal measure and the Discussion was enriched by the broad content and perspectives this brought. The major underlying theme to emerge was the essential need for closer integration of materials and process design-the use of isolated materials performance criteria in the absence of holistic process modelling for design and optimisation can be misleading. Indeed, combining process and materials simulation for reverse materials molecular engineering to achieve the required process performance and cost constraints is now within reach and is beginning to make a significant impact on optimising CCS and CCU (CO2 utilisation) processes in particular, as it is on materials science and engineering generally. Examples from the Discussion papers are used to illustrate this potential. The take-home messages from a range of other underpinning research themes key to CCUS are also summarised: new capture materials, materials characterisation and screening, process innovation, membranes, industrial processes, net negative emissions processes, the effect of GHG impurities, data requirements, environment sustainability and resource management, and policy. Some key points to emerge concerning carbon transport, utilisation and storage are also included, together with some overarching conclusions on how to develop more energy- and cost-effective CCS processes through improved integration of approach across the science-engineering spectrum. The discussion was first-rate in the best traditions of Faraday Discussions and hopefully will foster and stimulate further cross-disciplinary interactions and holistic approaches.",Maitland G.,Journal,Faraday Discussions,2016-01-01,Imperial College London,
Sustainable university: Beyond the third mission,"Higher education, especially nowadays, is subject to endless discussions and substantial reforms of performance management in universities across the world. The roots of the modern university go back 1,000 years to the University of Paris, where the unique aim was education and training. This was the first mission realised in the context of the Catholic Church. The way and the form of the modern university development throughout history has always been influenced by social triggers. The trigger for the second mission of research was Humboldt who led to the establishment of the University of Berlin in 1810 (Trencher et al., 2014). The major catalyst of the third mission and the university role of technology transfer was the emergence of an independent relationship between science, industrial innovation and government policy leading to the so-called ‘knowledge-based’ economy. With the new mission, managerialism entered the university with performance management as its integral part. Traditionally, performance management in universities has had a development role, i.e. helping individuals to improve their (future) performance. However, the new system is more judgemental, i.e. seeking to qualitatively evaluate (past) performance. There is a danger that the new system could inhibit creativity and anxiety about how the systems are used (Bogt and Scapens, 2012). Yet, the emergence of global entrepreneurial approach is not the last step in the ever-evolving modern university. There are many good examples, where co-creative partnership for sustainability is implemented, which is fundamentally different from conventional third mission activities. The paper analyses the way in which new performance systems are applied and their results and presents a case of co-creation for sustainability at the Institute of Environmental Engineering (APINI) at Kaunas University of Technology (KTU). It shows that the missions of education, research and technology transfer are able to potentially co-exist with co-creation for sustainability and complement the first three missions at a sustainable university.",Staniškis J.,Journal,"Environmental Research, Engineering and Management",2016-01-01,Kaunas University of Technology,
Predicting the probability for faculty adopting an audience response system in higher education,"Instructional technologies can be effective tools to foster student engagement, but university faculty may be reluctant to integrate innovative and evidence-based modern learning technologies into instruction. Based on Rogers' diffusion of innovation theory, this quantitative, nonexperimental, one-shot cross-sectional survey determined what attributes of innovation (relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability) predict the probability of faculty adopting the audience response system (ARS) into instruction. The sample of the study consisted of 201 faculty at a university in the southeastern United States. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to determine the attributes of innovation that predict the probability of faculty adopting the ARS into instruction. Out of the five attributes, compatibility and trialability made significant contributions to the model. The implication of the findings is that, in order to maximize adoption, the faculty needs to be given the opportunity to pre-test the ARS prior to implementation, and they need to know how the technology will assist them in achieving their pedagogical goals. Recommendations were made to leverage these attributes to foster faculty adoption of the ARS into instruction.",Chan T.; Borja M.; Welch B.; Batiuk M.,Journal,Journal of Information Technology Education: Research,2016-01-01,Walden University,Audience response system ;  Clicker ;  Instructional technology adoption
Preparing globally competent and competitive STEM workforce of the 21st century in the Global STEM Classroom®,"Technological advancements over the last decade have dramatically changed the reality of the STEM professional world, the way STEM professionals work, and the skills that are now required. One of the major changes is that STEM professionals are working in teams, generally multicultural teams in the United States or global teams collaborating through technology. Today's students - tomorrow's workers - without ability to learn and work with people from diverse cultural backgrounds, and skills to function productively in an interdependent world community will not be able to improve the United States' economic competitiveness, and provide leadership in innovation and creativity. The Global-STEM Classroom® reflects these rapid changes, addresses the new skill requirements, and provides innovative technology experiences for students and teachers by modeling authentic, multi-cultural, multi-disciplinary collaborative, STEM professional teamwork processes. The Global STEM Education Center, Inc 501 (c) (3) nonprofit founded in 2008 with a mission to ""increase participation in STEM disciplines by all students and, especially girls and students from underrepresented groups, to meet the needs of an innovation-driven globally competitive workforce"".

The Global STEM Classroom® implies creating virtual environment of one joint classroom where students from two or more schools in different countries receive instructions from one teacher as if they are in the same classroom (using both synchronous and asynchronous teaching and learning approaches). The participating schools are located in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia, Ukraine, Mexico, Norway and the Netherlands (Australia, Ireland, India will be joining next academic year). The Global STEM Classroom® program specifically addresses secondary education with students ages 12-17 years old (more than 50% girls and students from underrepresented groups) giving students a learning advantage in preparation for higher education, raising an awareness of and ""sparks"" the interest in engineering professional and studying STEM disciplines and expands cultural and technical competency for the global workforce. The Global STEM Classroom® participants typically complete real-life STEM (both research and hands-on) projects with an online virtual global student team. The present study was undertaken to answer the following research question: What are the attitudinal effects of participation the Global STEM Classroom® in terms of students' motivation for participation, levels of engagement, and interest in continuing to participate in similar projects? The research model was a within-group, change-over-time model and data collection relied largely upon pre-post survey findings to determine whether the Global STEM Classroom® was effective at meeting its declared objectives. The methods included an extensive online survey comprising the constructs embedded in the research question. Findings from the survey showed that: • Students chose to participate because they were motivated by the content, the possibility of collaborating internationally, or because they thought it would be good for their academic and future careers. • Students most enjoyed the interactive aspects of the project. • Students tended to use relatively simple and ubiquitous communication tools (e.g., Skype). • Teachers were motivated by the professional development opportunities and by the idea that the project would be good for their students. • Teachers also enjoyed the interactive aspects of participation, including the guest speakers (professional engineers and other STEM professionals) The above findings, however preliminary, show that the Global STEM Classroom® holds a great deal of promise for a larger-scale rollout. The Global STEM Classroom® is able to tap into students motivations and provide them with meaningful and innovative educational experiences that appear to have exercised significant effects on learning, attitudes, and behavior. There are important aspects of future research that will need to be addressed, however, including: a more complete sample with a full description of the participants, an assessment tool for measuring both fidelity of implementation and extent of exposure, and more work on assessments of learning that are tied to the actual content of the STEM projects.",Popov V.; Schelkin L.; Faux R.,Conference Proceeding,ASEE 2016 International Forum,2016-01-01,University of San Diego;DSRA;Global STEM Education Center,
"Administering a U.S. based M.S. degree in Kilimanjaro, Africa - A global benchmarking in regulatory science","In the world of pharmaceuticals, regulatory science is an emerging field that has goals of developing tools, drugs, devices, and practices to increase benefit and lower risk concerning safety, quality control, and effectiveness. The dangers of having a subpar, or non-existent, regulatory science practice can be costly at best, or lethal at worst. Formal education at the graduate level to train professionals is a relatively new field. Research has been done on the practice of regulatory science, but not on the institutions educating these scientists. Purdue's investment, in particular, has the ultimate goal of getting sustainable medicine to Africa. The collaboration of Purdue's Biotechnology Innovation and Regulatory Science program with the Kilimanjaro School of Pharmacy is helping to provide good regulatory practices in Africa. This prompted the need to perform benchmarking activities comparing and contrasting the Purdue program to both domestic and international certifications and degrees. The methodology employed to assess the potential list of resources was to make an exhaustive list (as possible, since higher education is constantly changing) of graduate and post-baccalaureate institutions that provide certification in regulatory science fields. First, the categories of cost, availability, and curriculum needed streamlining for comparison purposes. Then, best practices needed to be identified, for both domestic and international programs. Common themes of coursework in the life sciences, biotechnology, and policy/ethics were identified. Often, programs would require or prefer a bachelors in health science, life sciences, or engineering with common requirements of the advanced degree mandating courses in tissue engineering, stem cell engineering and related disciplines. The international programs focused more on global processes than domestic ones. In addition, there was a common trend, both domestically and internationally, that pharmaceutical sciences background/employment experience was preferred and the programs were designed to be part-time so the degree/certification could be earned while remaining employed (some required a project be completed at the student's place of employment). The most typical degree earned in this field was a Master's degree and while ranging in cost from $23,000-$100,000 in the domestic programs, the cost was typically much less expensive in the international programs.",Springer M.; Terruso L.; Speer M.; Ekeocha Z.; Byrn S.; Clase K.,Conference Proceeding,ASEE 2016 International Forum,2016-01-01,Purdue University;Kilimanjaro School of Pharmacy,
The attributes of future 2030 engineers in Qatar for innovation and knowledge based economy,"Recent studies emphasize the needs of a wider set of skills engineers require than ever thought. These studies continue to emphasize that technical content knowledge and competencies are essential for any engineer; however, in addition to being well-grounded in mathematics and science, 21st century engineers should be well-shaped in broader knowledge-base and diverse personal/ interpersonal key-skills. Qatar is increasingly investing in knowledge development within its boundary, either through home grown manpower or through collaborative efforts from research centres from around the world. Interviews with students, faculty, and representatives from the major industrial sectors in Qatar have been conducted. Quantitative analysis relied on comprehensive survey with multiple stakeholders from industry and academia, while qualitative analysis is constructed based on content analysis and grounded theory approaches. In this paper, authors report on the empirical study investigating the needs of skills in engineering in Qatar in the future for a knowledge based economy. Gaps have been identified, conceptualization is developed, and recommendations have been drawn upon.",Abdulwahed M.,Conference Proceeding,ASEE 2016 International Forum,2016-01-01,Qatar University,
Software startups-A research agenda,"Software startup companies develop innovative, software-intensive products within limited time frames and with few resources, searching for sustainable and scalable business models. Software startups are quite distinct from traditional mature software companies, but also from micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises, introducing new challenges relevant for software engineering research. This paper's research agenda focuses on software engineering in startups, identifying, in particular, 70+ research questions in the areas of supporting startup engineering activities, startup evolution models and patterns, ecosystems and innovation hubs, human aspects in software startups, applying startup concepts in non-startup environments, and methodologies and theories for startup research. We connect and motivate this research agenda with past studies in software startup research, while pointing out possible future directions. While all authors of this research agenda have their main background in Software Engineering or Computer Science, their interest in software startups broadens the perspective to the challenges, but also to the opportunities that emerge from multi-disciplinary research. Our audience is therefore primarily software engineering researchers, even though we aim at stimulating collaborations and research that crosses disciplinary boundaries. We believe that with this research agenda we cover a wide spectrum of the software startup industry current needs.",Unterkalmsteiner M.; Abrahamsson P.; Wang X.; Nguyen-Duc A.; Shah S.; Bajwa S.; Baltes G.; Conboy K.; Cullina E.; Dennehy D.; Edison H.; Fernandez-Sanchez C.; Garbajosa J.; Gorschek T.; Klotins E.; Hokkanen L.; Kon F.; Lunesu I.; Marchesi M.; Morgan L.; Oivo M.; Selig C.; Seppänen P.; Sweetman R.; Tyrväinen P.; Ungerer C.; Yagüe A.,Journal,E-Informatica Software Engineering Journal,2016-01-01,"Università degli Studi di Cagliari;RISE, Swedish Institute of Computer Science;Universidad Politécnica de Madrid;Maynooth University;Universität Konstanz;Hochschule Konstanz University of Applied Sciences;Blekinge Tekniska Högskola;Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet;Oulun Yliopisto;Tampere University;Free University of Bozen-Bolzano;University of Galway;Universidade de São Paulo",Research agenda ;  Software startup ;  Software-intensive systems
"Integrated approach bridging PLM, ERP, SCM in automobile industry","New Product Development (NDP) is a major source of competitive advantage to automobile manufacturers. More specifically, Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) has proven to have a positive impact on the effectiveness of the product development effort. One of the many reasons for that is the fact that PLM requires detailed attention to the constraints a firm will face, depending on the stage of the product. Widely accepted references outline the important of decision making in PLM. This trend is also is reinforced by the number of research projects in known, global centers of excellence in product development and innovation. Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) approach is in the stake to supply the plan to best use of resources allocated to the project. Another revered trend is the idea of integrating the whole supply chain from a value-adding perspective. Thus, the Supply Chain Management (SCM) and Manufacuturing Engineering Systemas (MES) of current and new suppliers for newly developed parts or products are the key players for the competitiveness in the market. Conversely, strategies, methodologies, and PLM tools present themselves as agile, lean, safe yet collaborative approach to NPD. This paper presents an integration of ERP into PLM with a special emphasis on SCM.

An Application of the Inventive Design Methodology to Thermal Systems: Improvement of the Insertion of Thermocouples in a Combustor,"Although technical innovation is increasingly essential to meet the new challenges in the field of thermal engineering, it is rare the application of means supporting systematic innovation commonly used in other areas. This paper aims stimulating the use of the Inventive Design methodology in the field of thermal engineering. It discusses the improvement of a thermocouple's mounting arrangement in a research combustor. The original design was based solely on the designer's creativity and understanding and the solution found to conciliate wall temperature measurement with the possibility and easiness of combustor disassembly for overhaul made sacrifices in both these design criteria. The paper explores a quantitative relation obtained from beam bending theory to improve the solution as to the later criterion. However, only through the application of the theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ), specifically the contradiction matrix tool, was it possible to evolve beyond the current thermocouple arrangement paradigm and identify two new designs with potential for noticeable improvements in: reduction of measurement error, prevention of probe damage, and readiness in combustor servicing. This case study shows that Inventive Design is worth of being included in the toolbox of thermal equipment designers.",Vaz D.; Martinho A.; Navas H.,Conference Proceeding,IFAC-PapersOnLine,2016-01-01,Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade Nova de Lisboa,Design methods ;  Innovation ;  Inventive Design ;  Temperature measurement ;  Thermal engineering ;  TRIZ application
Assessment of Lean Manufacturing and Six Sigma operation with Decision Making Based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process,"In this paper, an AHP model was used for determining the optimal method and the most efficient methodologies of lean manufacturing and six sigma in various industries based on three criteria. These criteria are financial performance, operational performance, and innovation performance. Study results show the impact of three categories that are based on the implementation of a specific method. Findings show that companies implementing lean and six sigma were more effective than companies that implemented either lean manufacturing only or used limited tools of lean six sigma across operational and financial performance. Meanwhile companies that used limited tools of lean six sigma gained minimal performance improvements. Additionally, the results illustrated that automobile industries followed by service and electronics industries have the most effectiveness in innovation, operational and financial performance. Moreover, this study shows struggle of lean manufacturing and/or six sigma implementation with transportation and health industries. Bibliographic investigation showed there is limited scientific research focusing on lean manufacturing and six sigma implementation within French industries.",Alhuraish I.; Robledo C.; Kobi A.,Conference Proceeding,IFAC-PapersOnLine,2016-01-01,Université d’Angers,Analytic Hierarchy Process ;  Lean manufacturing ;  Multi Criteria Decision ;  Six Sigma ;  Type of Industry
University innovation ecosystem as a mechanism of innovation process development,"In the context of modernization of Russian economy, the universities should become the major factor of knowledge intensive society, the basis of which constitutes not only highly qualified staff but also production of knowledge and its commercialization. Realization of the assigned task depends in many respects on efficiency of the process of commercialization of Intellectual Activity Results (IAR) which is reached in many respects thanks to the development of innovation ecosystem of a higher educational institution. The solution of the problems of commercialization of university researches and development depends on effective functioning of innovative ecosystem of the university contributing to the transformation of scientific researches and development into a market product. This research work is devoted to the analysis of the problems of functioning of innovative ecosystem of the university. The objective of this research is a justification of innovation ecosystem significance and identification of its prospects in the development of commercialization of intellectual activity results in a higher educational institution. According to the researchers, the prospects of development of innovative ecosystem of the university are considered in strategic development and interaction of its three basic components (constituents) which are carrying out stimulation of scientific researches, provision of their commercialization and formation of partnership organizational culture in total with necessary competences of innovative business. The formation of these competences must be secured as a compulsory component in the educational program of higher professional education for engineering specialties as well as through regular advanced professional training of employees and administrators of the elements of the innovation infrastructure of the university.

Novel integrated circuit platforms employing monolithic silicon CMOS + GaN devices,"We describe the research results produced from our focus on integrating GaN HEMTs and LEDs into silicon CMOS integrated circuits. Although current component markets are driving most GaN HEMT development, we have undertaken an innovation path in which the value of an integrated GaN device in a silicon design environment is the driver for materials and device development. Our integrated process flow employs standard foundry production of front and back end CMOS. Such constraints demand certain GaN epitaxial and material criterion that is different than those on non-integrated devices. We report on 200 mm GaN-on-Si 725 um thick engineered substrates formed through a combination of MOCVD and wafer bonding processes. We have developed wafer engineering techniques such as edge encapsulation and substrate replacement to address wafer fragility issues typically associated with GaN on SEMI-spec 725 um Si wafers. This also leads new wafer/device platforms such as GaN-OI and CMOS + GaN that will open new avenues in device performance and integration of III-N with Si CMOS.",Fitzgerald E.; Lee K.; Zhang L.; Huang C.; Kadir A.; Bao S.; Ren Z.; Wang C.; Wang Y.; Lee K.; Liu Z.; Palacios T.; Tan C.; Ng G.; Chua S.,Conference Proceeding,ECS Transactions,2016-01-01,Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology;Massachusetts Institute of Technology;National University of Singapore;Nanyang Technological University,

Ultra low emission technology innovations for mid-century aircraft turbine engines,"Commercial transport fuel efficiency has improved dramatically since the early 1950s. In the coming decades the ubiquitous turbofan powered tube and wing aircraft configuration will be challenged by diminishing returns on investment with regards to fuel efficiency. From the engine perspective two routes to radically improved fuel efficiency are being explored; ultra-efficient low pressure systems and ultraefficient core concepts. The first route is characterized by the development of geared and open rotor engine architectures but also configurations where potential synergies between engine and aircraft installations are exploited. For the second route, disruptive technologies such as intercooling, intercooling and recuperation, constant volume combustion as well as novel high temperature materials for ultra-high pressure ratio engines are being considered. This paper describes a recently launched European research effort to explore and develop synergistic combinations of radical technologies to TRL 2. The combinations are integrated into optimized engine concepts promising to deliver ultra-low emission engines. The paper discusses a structured technique to combine disruptive technologies and proposes a simple means to quantitatively screen engine concepts at an early stage of analysis.

Experimental and numerical researches on aluminium alloy systems for structural applications in civil engineering fields,"Structural research and applications of aluminium structures in civil engineering field have grown extensively in the last decades. Low weight, corrosion resistance, production of special profiles by extrusion and aesthetic quality of the aluminium material, together with the availability of specific and detailed design codes at both Italian (CNR-DT 208/2011) and European (Eurocode 9) level, have furthered such a development. On the other hand, in recent years, several experimental and numerical researches have been developed in order to improve the comprehension of the structural behaviour of aluminium elements, such as extruded and welded members, connections and joints, special devices, giving an important contribution to the present structural codes. This paper gives an overview of some of the researches developed recently by the authors which are strictly connected to the design and innovation of aluminium alloy structures. In particular, the behaviour of aluminium alloy members, joints and seismic protection devices is analysed, illustrating the results obtained by the above research programs. They put into evidence interesting aspects that deserve further research activities for improving the present codes on aluminium structures, as well as the high potentiality of the aluminium material to be used as alternative to steel for interesting and convenient applications in structural engineering.",Formisano A.; De Matteis G.; Mazzolani F.,Book Series,Key Engineering Materials,2016-01-01,Università degli Studi della Campania Luigi Vanvitelli;Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II,Aluminium shear panels ;  Extruded members ;  Reticular space structures ;  Seismic protection devices ;  T-stub joints

A multidimensional profile model of ambidexterity and innovation: An empirical case study,"The purpose of this study is to examine which combination of dimensional features of ambidexterity influences innovation. Furthermore, this study examines the way in which the combination of dimensional features of ambidexterity influences an organisation's ability to innovate. We used a single holistic case study design and conducted semi-structured interviews with innovation experts from an outdoor company. We used template analysis to analyse our data. Unlike existing studies that examined ambidexterity in relation to innovation by offering theoretical arguments, simulations and little empirical research, we contribute a multidimensional profile model, comprised of a combination of the different features associated with the dimensions of organisational ambidexterity, to the existing literature. Based on this, we explain how some dimensional features of ambidexterity are identified, and subsequently how their combinations influence an organisation's ability to innovate. We also contribute to the literature on profile models of multidimensional constructs. We suggest that future research could longitudinally examine organisational ambidexterity from a multidimensional view through multiple cross-industry cases.",Von Gottberg J.; Matheus T.; Sarma M.,Journal,"International Journal of Technology, Policy and Management",2016-01-01,Newcastle Business School,Ambidexterity ;  Innovation ;  Multidimensional Profile Model
Process redesign for time-based emergency admission targets: Staff perceptions of the impact on quality of care,"Purpose: Hospitals have used process redesign to increase the efficiency of the emergency department (ED) to cope with increasing demand. While there are published studies suggesting a positive outcome, recent reviews have reported that it is difficult to conclude that these approaches are effective as a result of substandard research methodology. The purpose of this paper is to explore the perceptions of hospital staff on the impact of a process redesign initiative on quality of care. Design/methodology/approach: A retrospective qualitative case study examining a Lean Six Sigma (LSS) initiative in a large metropolitan hospital from 2009 to 2010. Non-probability sampling identified interview subjects who, through their participation in the redesign initiative, had a detailed understanding of the implementation and outcomes of the initiative. Between April 2012 and January 2013 26 in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted and analysed with thematic content analysis. Findings: There were four important findings. First, when asked to comment on the impact of the LSS implementation, without prompting the staff spoke of quality of care. Second, there was little agreement among the participants as to whether the project had been successful. Third, despite the recognition of the need for a coordinated effort across the hospital to improve ED access, the redesign process was not successful in reducing existing divides among clinicians and among managers and clinicians. Finally, staff expressed tension between production processes to move patients more quickly and their duty of care to their patients as individuals. Originality/value: One of the first studies to explore the impact of process redesign through in-depth interviews with participating staff, this study adds further evidence that organisations implementing process redesign must ensure the supporting management practices are in place.",G.

MPM4CPS: Multi-paradigm modelling for cyber-physical systems,"The last decades have seen the emergence of truly complex, designed systems, known as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Engineering such systems requires integrating physical, software, and network aspects. To date, neither a unifying theory nor systematic design methods, techniques and tools exist to meet this challenge. Individual engineering disciplines, such as mechanical, electrical, network and software engineering offer only partial solutions. Multi-Paradigm Modelling (MPM) proposes to model every part and aspect of a system, including development processes, explicitly, at the most appropriate level(s) of abstraction, using the most appropriate modelling formalism(s). Modelling language engineering, including model transformation, and the study of their semantics, are used to realize MPM. MPM is seen as an effective answer to the challenges of designing Cyber-Physical Systems. Research on modelling CPS is typically based on national activities with loose international interaction. To establish an interdisciplinary and inter-institutional platform for scientific information exchange, consensus building, and collaboration, the COST Action MPM4CPS, funded by the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, has been initiated. MPM4CPS aims to develop and share foundations, techniques, and tools related to Multi-Paradigm Modelling for Cyber-Physical Systems (MPM4CPS) and to provide educational resources.

The Mine Haul Road Optimisation Alliance - An industry and academia collaboration,"The Mine Haul Road Optimization Alliance is an Australian industry-academia collaboration which has been developed to support mine haul road operators by fully integrating mine road design research solutions with industry end-user service providers to design, assess, implement and monitor the various equipment, materials and road management strategies required to optimize the safety, environmental and economic performance of a haul road. Initially, a broad overview of the university-industry collaborative landscape is presented, following which the current situation in the Australian mining sector is reviewed both nationally, and on a countrywide basis, internationally. This insight places realization of a collaboration between Curtin University Western Australian School of Mines Mining Engineering and Metallurgical Engineering (WASM ME2) and the Haul Road Optimization Alliance (HROA) industry members into context of opportunity. Following an overview of the HROA collaborative structure, aims and objectives, it is shown how academia and industry can collaborate to deliver a more robust solution to mine haul road design, performance or management needs, especially where integrated solutions are needed. Critically in this approach, implementation and monitoring data provided by industry and service-providers alike forms the foundation on which to develop research knowledge and innovation that is more responsive to the end-user requirements, typically represented by 'early goals' and implementable solutions. The paper concludes with examples of how the alliance collaborations work in practice to deliver improved mine haul road designs and optimized operational performance, together with the mechanisms used to ensure industry needs are met through focused, end-user driven research and integrated solutions implementation.",Handel D.; Miedecke J.; Thompson R.; Tomicek E.; Tulloch D.,Conference Proceeding,2016 SME Annual Conference and Expo: The Future for Mining in a Data-Driven World,2016-01-01,Curtin University;Australian Diversified Engineering;RoadSafety Training Services Pty Ltd.;Proof Engineers Pty Ltd.;RST,
Brazilian community universities and regional policies for technology and innovation,"In recent years, Brazil has sought to adapt its technical policies, industries and encouraging innovation sectors such as academia, industry and the government itself. In this paper will be presented one option to foster these policies by establishing university research parks supported by Community Universities in Brazil. The interactive design innovation certainly was a step toward adopting the systemic model that basically brought an approach and focus not only businesses and market, or in research, thus recognizing a system and interaction of agents. It is understood that the political and institutional arrangements that support and streamline the scientific and technological production showed changes in their training and performance in recent years. It is at this point that the dynamics of university-industry relations, public-private-partnership (PPP), are emerging as one of the key solutions to enhance technology and foster innovation. Thus, combining scientific knowledge and technique can bring technology, new processes that influence behavior including social, economic, from one location. In Brazil, one of the trends to foster this interaction between agents is the combination of efforts between universities and the productive sector in the formation of regional university research parks. In this context, they are Community Universities, which in its constitution differ from the Brazilian public universities, as they allow for greater flexibility and agility in the development of relations with the private sector. Brazilian Community Universities represent a segment of higher education institutions, which, in addition to teaching, are directed to the community, providing various social activities for several decades. Created by civil society and the public of local government in which they operate, they have no profit, all of which earned funds are invested in the institution and in projects for the community. They are strongly recognized by the community as an important factor of development. This study aims to present the importance of creating regional policies at Community Brazilian universities to local and regional technological development, especially in the university research parks training support. On the methodology adopted in this study, we adopted the basic qualitative research where data collection was done through the analysis of documents and professional experiences. As to the objectives, it is an exploratory research in order to explain the main features of the issues addressed. The sources, it is a secondary literature, based on previously published material. The conclusions point out that the strengthening of regional technology policy is fundamental to the Community Brazilian universities further contribute to the technological development of the regions in which they operate. In this sense, university research parks, demonstrate to be an important tool for universities, allowing them a strengthening of their role and importance in the locality and likewise for university research parks that get a scientific and organizational support already structured. It is recognized that this article has limitations and it is recommended that others studies with other research institutions need to be carried out, allowing a comparative study done on this, enabling a more expanded view of the Brazilian scene.",Fontanela C.; Santos M.; Da Silva Albino J.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2016 - 25th International Association for Management of Technology Conference, Proceedings: Technology - Future Thinking",2016-01-01,Universidade do Estado de Mato Grosso;Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina;Universidade Comunitária da Região de Chapecó,Innovation ;  Policies ;  Technology ;  Universities ;  University research park
Academic entrepreneurship in high technology in Austria,"Entrepreneurship plays an important role in economic development, in supporting technological innovations, increasing economic efficiency and, as a consequence, in creating new jobs. Austria, has many university graduates with a technical background and a high potential for starting a business in high technology. However, a recent large study revealed that the majority of graduates of technical universities becomes something else than entrepreneurs. This is one of the reasons that Austria has a lower level of total-entrepreneurial-activity than ""entrepreneurial"" countries such as the United States. However, there has been little discussion on the concrete changes necessary, as little is known about the factors that motivate university graduates to become entrepreneurs. Different authors indicate that studies among alumni could provide a more precise picture of the actual drivers and inhibitors of entrepreneurial activity of university graduates. So far, researchers have claimed that universities merely teach their students to become skilled employees in large organizations. However, research also shows that the entrepreneur's individual competencies are of central importance in the process of business formation. Consequently, in addition to a literature overview on factors influencing the entrepreneurial process and a review on entrepreneurial competencies, this paper will present the results of a recent qualitative interview study conducted by the authors. In this study, a sample of nine practitioners in high technology, who all graduated from a bachelor's, a master's or a PhD program in a technical university in Austria, were interviewed on the basis of an interview manual prepared for that purpose. This study was conducted with aim to get insight what influences the decision to become an entrepreneur in high technology and to get a first overview which competencies are needed as an entrepreneur from an entrepreneur's point of view. The results of this study revealed that graduates of technical universities in Austria are only to a small extent aware of the possibility to become an entrepreneur and have a feeling that they lack the appropriate competencies entrepreneurs in technology-based ventures need. Results of the interview study also indicate that universities, to a certain extent, fail to provide their graduates with the skills required as an entrepreneur. Hence, universities are advised to consider changes in strategy, culture and practice to become more entrepreneurial. The results of our study will serve as a basis for further research. An ideal competence profile for entrepreneurs in technology-based ventures will be elaborated on the basis of a future quantitative study among academic technology-based entrepreneurs who started their business in an incubator in Austria. This competence profile will then serve as an important guideline for universities in Austria to work up their way in becoming entrepreneurial universities and will also help incubators to define their offerings as needed by the entrepreneurs.",Soos J.; Kerschenbauer J.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2016 - 25th International Association for Management of Technology Conference, Proceedings: Technology - Future Thinking",2016-01-01,Technische Universitat Graz,Academic entrepreneurship ;  Austria ;  Entrepreneurial competencies ;  High technology
A two phase case study on implementation of open source development practices within a company setting,"Implementation of open source development practices within commercial settings can bring benefits such as improved source code quality, lower maintenance costs, and increased innovation. However, a widespread in-house implementation of the practices has not been observed. The goal of this research is to understand factors which hinder the implementation. For the purpose, development practices of a large, global software and hardware organization that bases its products on open source software, and has over a decade long experience of contributing to various open source projects were studied. The results were validated through a set of structured interviews and a focus group meeting. It is found that the initial implementation of the process has not been carried out in a planned and systematic way within the company. The results of the follow-up focus group meeting show that while the company's practices acquired a higher degree of alignment over a two-year period, the change was necessitated by a need to have a more efficient development effort across new, globally distributed, development sites.",Orucevíc-Alagíc A.; Höst M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering, SEKE",2016-01-01,Lunds Universitet,
Universities' third mission activities: Case study from Egypt,"Universities are essential constituents in the socio-economic development, as proposed by the Triple Helix Model presented by Loet Leydesdorff and Henry Etzkowitz in the 1990s. Innovation is an important element related to the socio-economic development. On the other hand, a university can foster innovation by being the main source of knowledge and technological advancements. In the late 20th century, the concept of Entrepreneurial University evolved. This concept revolves around the universities that include socio-economic development as its third mission beside their basic two missions, namely: teaching and research. This third mission can be defined as a range of activities involving the university's interaction with the community and the usage of its capabilities outside the academic environment. Being a developing country, Egypt needs to improve its global competitiveness through developing its economic and social status. With the tremendous speed of technological advancements and the emergence of knowledge economy, the need for improvement necessitates the reformation of the Egyptian higher education system in order to meet the current and future needs of the Egyptian community. Such reforms can help create a new holistic understanding of the universities' role. This research is an assessment based on the perspectives of universities' professors regarding the third mission role as applied to three large Egyptian governmental universities. The assessment of this role can help in the reformation of the Egyptian higher education system. The assessment evaluates the existence of some pre-conditions for the universities' to achieve their third mission. It also evaluates the role of the universities' main actors and the universities' link with their partners. The current status of the third mission activities, filtered from literature, is analyzed in depth. The research is a qualitative type of research using multiple case studies. The chosen study sample is from the faculties of Electrical Engineering in the aforementioned three Egyptian governmental universities. The methodology involves semi-structured interviews with the universities' professors and a research funding agency to gather the required data. The research results are concluded by grouping and summarizing the common strengths and obstacles facing the universities in developing their third mission role. Some initiatives taken towards developing the universities' third mission role are also discussed. Lastly, a list of recommendations is proposed for developing such role. The development of the universities' third mission role is believed to contribute positively to the Egyptian socio-economic development.",El-Katatny M.; Awny M.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2016 - 25th International Association for Management of Technology Conference, Proceedings: Technology - Future Thinking",2016-01-01,Nile University,Entrepreneurial University ;  Innovation ;  Socio-Economic Development ;  Triple Helix Model ;  University Third Mission

Proposal for an innovation model for Brazilian small and medium technology-based enterprises,"Technological Innovation Processes are fundamental to give competitive strength to companies. The actions undertaken in this process can be motivated by intentions like to comply with new demands of the market, to add value to existing products and services and to generate new products or services. Those actions of innovation reflect organizational skills that renews the competitive vigor and contribute to the longevity of the companies. Innovation processes may change from company to company and can be influenced by, among other things, the industry sector or the size of the company. It is at this point that emerges the focus of interest of this research, which comes to the technological innovation process in Brazilian small and medium technology-based enterprises. Given the above, this paper aims to propose an innovation model for Brazilian small and medium technology-based enterprises. The theoretical framework used is composed by six our models of innovation: the technology push, the market pull, the coupling innovation process, the functional integration innovation process, the systems integration and networking innovation process and open innovation. The methodological approach used was the qualitative multiple case study. The data collection instrument used was the semi-structured interviews with entrepreneurs and analysis occurred for each case and then making a comparison between the cases in search of similarities and differences leading to the formation of valid results. Seven Brazilian companies located in Metropolitan Region of Paraíba Valley and North Coast - São Paulo State, Brazil, composed the sample. With the results, it can be said that Brazilian small and medium technology-based enterprises do not innovate alone, but in the context of networking system with university, research centers and several companies. Thereby, technological innovation is an ongoing collaborative process involving the activities of management, coordination, learning and negotiation, research about customer needs, skills acquisition and new product development management. Finally, it was possible to draw up an integrative innovation model that explain how occurs the process of innovation in the companies that composed the sample. The model consists of four main phases that are the generation and dissemination of ideas; the viability of the idea; development, prototyping, production scale and marketing; and learning.",Moraes M.; De Oliveira E.; Miranda M.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2016 - 25th International Association for Management of Technology Conference, Proceedings: Technology - Future Thinking",2016-01-01,Universidade de Taubate;Universidade Federal da Bahia,Development ;  Innovation ;  Innovation Model ;  Management ;  SMES

Engineering optimal network effects and quality for information goods,"Recently firms are increasingly proactive in strategically managing the consumer networks and social media interactions with customers. In this paper, we investigate a research on engineering network effects by a different angle through which the firm can strategically regulate the network effects in conjunction with quality, both have direct impacts on the consumer utility. We consider how the firm should reasonably make decision on both network effects via social media and quality by innovation in tandem with pricing strategy at utility level, showing that the firm can get more revenue when by network effects. Though the network effects have great importance on profits and market coverage, quality is still the essential condition for firm entering the market. The constraint budget doesn't have effects on the optimal strategies choosing, but maybe weaken the conditions under which the full market strategy is dominant.

Integrating Product and Technology Development: A Proposed Reference Model for Dual Innovation,"Although dual innovation projects, defined in this article as the concurrent development of products and technologies, often occur in industry, these are only scarcely supported methodologically. Limited research has been done about dual innovation projects and their inherent challenges (e.g. managing dependencies) and opportunities (e.g. streamlining development). This paper presents five existing reference models for technology development (TD), which were identified via a systematic literature review, where their possible integration with product development (PD) reference models was investigated. Based on the specific characteristics desired for dual innovation projects, such as integrated product development and coverage of multiple development stages, a set of selection criteria was employed to select suitable PD and TD reference models. The integration and adaptation of the selected models has led to a proposed integrated reference model for dual innovation that is currently being instantiated in the context of an ongoing action research project.",Brilhuis-Meijer E.; Pigosso D.; McAloone T.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2016-01-01,Technical University of Denmark,concurrent engineering ;  product development ;  reference model ;  technology development ;  technology readiness level
Multilevel Design Education for Innovation Competencies,"The competencies to manage an engineering project, work in and lead a team are demanded from a graduate of a higher engineering education. A design education model, consisting of of two linked courses, is presented that allows students to learn key engineering and social competencies by experiencing real situations. During the course ""Innovation Project"" (IP) approx. 450 freshman solve a development task in a team (creating a mechatronic system). The course ""Leading Engineering Projects and Coaching Design Teams"" educates IP student coaches in team dynamics and how to coach an innovation team. The aim of this paper is to present the recent development of the educational model. In this paper we focus on the IP course. The team climate curves are analysed and the qualitative data describing the turning points in the team climate curves is used to derive critical competencies for the IP teams. Four different competency clusters were found. The results show that not only technical skills are learned in this course but even more so multidisciplinary skills. The influence of the coaches for competency development is ongoing research and will be evaluated in further research. The results underline the need for educational approaches that focus on technical skills as well as multidisciplinary skills. The education model prepares the students well for their future design challenges.",Heinis T.; Goller I.; Meboldt M.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2016-01-01,ETH Zürich,best practice example ;  coaching ;  competencies for innovation ;  design education ;  innovative concepts in education ;  team climate
Current Trends in Product Development,"This paper will summarize the authors' experience over the last decades, from new methods developed and used within Product Development, as well as current trends. Hence a general and broad overview is presented, rather than recent research results. Driving forces in PD are: Technology, Market and Society. Ecological, economic and social sustainability require recycling, reuse, energy conservation and new business concepts. Customization is carried out by modular architecture, combining customer specific products with volume production of components and sub-systems. PD integrates ""hard"" properties (engineering), with ""soft"" properties (industrial design). Fundamental PD characteristics are: Iteration, Integration (technical and organizational), and Innovation. Globally distributed industrial partners co-operate using Internet. Iteration: process loops are speeded up by modeling/simulation, virtual prototyping and additive manufacturing. Structured PD: Initial specification of ""what""-functional requirements, then ""how""-generation of design solutions. Interdependencies analysis is important to simplify the product's structure. The V-model for specification and verification is commonly used. A 3-stage industrial process separates strategy, core technology development, and product design for market introduction.",Persson J.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2016-01-01,The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH),Engineering design ;  Industrial design ;  Life cycle ;  Product development ;  Sustainability ;  Virtual prototyping
Applying human factors research towards cyberspace operations: A practitioner’s perspective,"Cyberspace operations are dependent upon highly sophisticated technology. Unfortunately, it is challenging to find or develop solutions that successfully support critical processes and decisions. Innovation, and the resources associated with innovation, appear to focus primarily on the technology with little emphasis on the human factors associated with employment, training, and sustainment of the capabilities. Researchers and vendors often mistakenly apply information technology solutions to cyberspace operations problems. In such cases, a poor understanding of the nature of the cognitive work and the goals in cyberspace operations results in technologies that are of limited usefulness and usability with regard to the purpose and scale of military operations. This paper presents a practitioner’s perspective on the core human factors of cyberspace operations. It concludes with strong recommendations for how to better incorporate cognitive engineering and experimental psychology practices into research and development projects.",Lathrop S.; Trent S.; Hoffman R.,Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2016-01-01,"Soar Technology, Inc.;Florida Institute for Human & Machine Cognition;United States Cyber Command",Cybersecurity ;  Cyberspace operations ;  Human factors
"Resilience engineering, gaps and prescription of safe work method statements part 1: The view of organisational outsiders","The construction industry is frequently cited for its poor safety performance. In spite of this, many countries continue to rely on contemporary, prescriptive approaches to improve performance in the sector. In Australia, one such approach, Safe Work Method Statements (SWIMS), have been mandated in construction work. However, there is limited empirical research on SWIMS, so their ability to improve health and safety is largely unknown. This is a significant gap in our knowledge. Recent research suggests that Resilience Engineering (RE), which is an innovation in organisational health and safety management, offers a promising approach, by understanding the gap between work as imagined and work as performed. SWIMS provide a practical tool by which such a gap can be investigated in construction settings. Recent research also suggests that organisations are part of a broader socio-technical system. As such, gaining a view of the different elements of the system is an important first step towards developing an understanding of the role SWIMS play in health and safety risk management. This paper first describes the socio-technical system that constitute construction work; followed by an exploration of the meaning SWIMS as ascribed by the external agencies as the first ‘outsider’ of this system. It is based on an analysis of data collected as part of a larger PhD study of the prescription and practice of SWMS in the Australian construction industry.",Pillay M.,Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2016-01-01,"The University of Newcastle, Australia",Construction health and safety ;  Resilience engineering ;  Safe work method statements ;  Work-as-imagined

Functional mechanism and empirical study on low-carbon transformation of mine enterprise,"At the moment low-carbon era, the low-carbon transformation has become necessary for the sustainable development for mine enterprise. The influencing factors theoretical model is primarily established in the paper for analyzing the functional mechanism of the four driving factors including low carbon rule, structure optimization, technical innovation and energetic efficiency, based on which the LMDI analysis method is used to verify the influence degree on mine enterprise low-carbon transformation. Previous research showed that main driving factor affecting the carbon intensity is the energetic strength other than the energetic consumption structure. The incremental situation of carbon emission mainly derives from the economic development. The empirical study by using panel data model proves the influence degree of different factors on different types of mine enterprises, pointing that different types of mine enterprise will bring obvious different influencing factors in carbon emission, and the influence degrees of same factor to different mine enterprises are also different. Therefore, during the promotion of mine enterprise low-carbon transformation, different adjusting strategies and measures shall be taken for different mine enterprise to obtain better transformation effect.",Jia X.; Lu C.; Wang X.,Journal,International Journal of Earth Sciences and Engineering,2016-01-01,Xi'an International University;Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology;Xi'an University of Science and Technology,Carbon emission ;  LMDI analysis method ;  Low-carbon transformation ;  Mine enterprise

Regulations: Facilitating advancement or serving as a barrier - A shared responsibility,"Product innovation and sustained economic growth for science based companies requires the continued integration of diverse technology capabilities to create high performance, improved products that meet market needs and demands. Nanotechnology is an enabling technology with applications applicable to every materials market (e.g., medical applications, devices and microelectronics, energy/industrial, bioremediation, coatings and dispersions). The responsible utilization and adoption of this technology will be impacted either favorably or unfavorably by the regulatory requirements for its oversight and further development. These regulatory requirements can either provide a platform which facilitates decision making and responsible technology adoption or create unnecessary barriers to innovation and technology utilization. Regulations can assist in identifying potential risks while avoiding unnecessary data generation, time delays and increased costs. Ensuring that regulatory oversight addresses potential environmental, health and safety (EHS) concerns while allowing innovation and technology adoption is best achieved through the use of an integrated approach. Such an approach should utilize, as appropriate, product stewardship, voluntary, collaborative and mandatory measures to achieve the desired EHS objectives. To have the best chance for success, such an integrated approach must be a shared responsibility among all stakeholders. This paper will explore three key aspects of such a shared integrated approach to efficient, effective and proportional regulatory oversight of nanotechnology.",Medley T.,Book Series,ACS Symposium Series,2016-01-01,DuPont,

The impact of knowledge based organizations on managerial reengineering,"Adapting to the requirements and demands of the global economy depends, to a large extent, on the development of a new type of organization, with a different management. The organization and management based on knowledge are the result of complex, burdensome efforts, in which the objectives, modalities of resources employed and organizational culture have new dimensions. One way to promote and develop knowledge management is by means of managerial reengineering, based on five components: objectives - processes - structures - people (managers and performers) - results. Considered a development of the already popular BPR (Business Process Reengineering), managerial reengineering aims the whole management of the company, from organizational component to human resources management, decision-making, informational and methodological components. The new type of organization creates unprecedented opportunities in order to improve the management role in achieving performance, through knowledge reconsidering and intellectual capital. Managerial Reengineering conducted under these new conditions requires a new type of management exercised by T-managers with the active and responsible participation of knowledge based employees. Our work shows direct links between reengineering, on one hand, and the organization and management based on knowledge, on the other hand, by showing the connection type cause - effect.",Verboncu I.; Fucec A.; Serban A.; Rusu M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 27th International Business Information Management Association Conference - Innovation Management and Education Excellence Vision 2020: From Regional Development Sustainability to Global Economic Growth, IBIMA 2016",2016-01-01,Bucharest University of Economic Studies,Business process reengineering ;  Knowledge management ;  Knowledge organization
Cost-benefit analysis for green fertilizer technology development: A case in Malaysia,This paper highlights a model for determining the cost and benefits (CBA) analysis of a green fertilizer technology development research program in Malaysia. A five-stage process model for the Cost-Benefit Analysis is developed to focus on the value of several projects undertaken within the research program. The five stages of the CBA model are to: (i) identify the deliverable of each project; (ii) identify the advantages and disadvantages (opportunity cost) of each deliverable; (iii) qualify the advantages; (iv) quantify the advantages and; (v) monetize the advantages.

Using all the tools in the toolbox - Case studies in process improvement,"At commissioning, a chemical manufacturing plant represents the end results of years, and sometimes decades, of research and continuous improvement in design. Each plant is built with a goal of maximizing the economic return for that investment. However, it is doubtful if any plant has ever been built that did not contain an opportunity to reduce cost or otherwise improve performance at some point in its lifetime. Even if a plant were to be built that represented the state of the art in performance by every measure, the reality that markets are not static and scientific innovation inexorably advances means that opportunities to maximize the value from these expensive assets will continue to be created. Factors that create opportunities for value creation or preservation will be presented. A challenge for process researchers is that project timing and resource availability invariably complicate the problem-solving process. A series of examples will be discussed that demonstrate the use of available tools (modeling, lab-scale experimentation, pilot-scale development) to achieve process improvement goals.",Marshall K.; Onam S.; Singh A.,Conference Proceeding,Process Development Division 2016 - Core Programming Area at the 2016 AIChE Spring Meeting and 12th Global Congress on Process Safety,2016-01-01,The Dow Chemical Company,Catalysts ;  Kinetics ;  Statistical analysis
Assessing contractor’s innovation issues in a large complex civil engineering project in Pakistan,"This is a research paper focused on assessing the main Contractor managers/senior engineer’s perceptions of managing innovation issues relating to a civil engineering project in Pakistan. In order to consider more implicitly the questions and issues raised, this empirical groundwork utilised an interpretive perspective. The scope for this research was the Contractor managers/senior engineers of a single civil engineering project. The population for this study was made up of a number of individual Contractor managers/senior engineer’s (17) located at one main-site, and a total of 12 managers/senior engineers were determined as the resultant sample frame. The outcomes consisted of five (5) main themes, namely: Stakeholders, Management Strategy, Process Developments, Technical Issues, Contractual Issues; and sixteen (16) sub-themes raised from a literature embedded question. The paper establishes that innovation continues to be augmented in a complex project, but may not be effectively characterised in order to establish how important or effective such practices are to the project cost and scheduling. Very little research has been conducted in this area in heavy civil engineering projects and the paper exposes innovation issues, which is previously unexplored in today’s demanding international civil engineering environment.",James P.,Journal,International Journal of Applied Engineering Research,2016-01-01,Bangkok University,Civil engineering ;  Innovation ;  Management ;  Projects

Promise and plausibility: Health technology adoption decisions with limited evidence,"Background: The adoption of new medical devices and diagnostics is often hampered by lack of published evidence which makes conventional health technology assessment (HTA) difficult. We now have 5 years' experience of the Medical Technologies Advisory Committee of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom, addressing this problem. This committee assesses devices and diagnostics against claims of advantage, to produce guidance on adoption for the health service. Methods: We have reflected on the practical, technical, and intellectual processes we have used in developing guidance for the health service. Results: When scientific and clinical evidence is sparse, promise and plausibility play an increased part in decision-making. Drivers of promise include a clear design and mechanism of action, the possibility of radical improvement in care and/or resource use, and improving health outcomes for large numbers of patients. Plausibility relates to judgements about the whether the promise is likely to be delivered in a real world setting. Promise and plausibility need to be balanced against the amount of evidence available. We examine the influence they may have on decision-making compared with other factors such as risk and cost. Conclusions: Decisions about adoption of new devices and diagnostics with little evidence are influenced by judgements of their promise and the plausibility of claims that they will provide benefits in a real-world setting. This kind of decision making needs to be transparent and this article explains how these influences can be balanced against the use of more familiar criteria.",Campbell B.; Knox P.,Journal,International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care,2016-01-01,National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE);University of Liverpool,Evidence ;  Innovation ;  Medical technology ;  Promise ;  Technology assessment

Axiological foundations of social engineering: Prospects for modernization of Russian society,"The article analyzes the problem of the relationship of values and knowledge in the process of social engineering. Boundaries and possibilities for technological intervention in the natural functioning of the social order are considered in the context of the formation of the idea of phased modernization of society. Sociological research detected the cognitive and methodological potential model of interaction between values and knowledge suggested by G. Myrdal. Methodological issues in applying sociological knowledge to the process of development and realization of social engineering programs are considered as essential to unite values with the objective. The authors investigated the problem of preparations of a society and social engineers, managers, sociologists, experts to link values with objectified theoretical and empirical knowledge, in order to implement their programs of social technologies. On the basis of sociological research among Russian youth the social determinants are discussed that form new values' structures and backbone models of social practices. On the basis of empirical data we state that the institutional environment is perceived as unstable, where processes completely depend on subjects of power, decisions of certain strong personalities. Conclusions of authors of article from empirical research speak of essential barriers for institutionalization of innovations and reproduction of successful sociocultural experience, of insufficient potential of social activity of modern Russian society for system transformations, innovative development and a reorganization of society. In the next five years no more than a quarter of young people will begin to join on own initiative active social designing of the Russian society. Therefore, G. Myrdal's formula does not work either in social designing, or in social engineering in general - we have no ready set of values, invariant to social determinants.

"What Kind of Modern ""green"" Chemical Engineering is Required for the Design of the ""factory of Future""?","Confronted with the globalization of the markets, acceleration of partnerships and innovation, and to offer a contribution to the fight against environmental destruction and non sustainable behaviour of the today world production, the chemical and related industries militate for the evolution of chemical engineering in favour of a modern process engineering voluntarily concerned by sustainability (the green process engineering) that will face new challenges and stakes bearing on complex systems at the molecular scale, at the product scale and at the process scale. Indeed the existing and the future processes will be progressively adapted to the principles of the "" green chemistry "" which involves a modern approach of chemical engineering that satisfies both the market requirements for specific nano and microscale end-use properties of competitive targeted green (sustainable) products, and the social and environmental constraints of sustainable industrial meso and macroscale production processes at the scales of the units and sites of production. These last constraints require an integrated system approach of complex multidisciplinary, non-linear, non equilibrium processes and transport phenomena occurring on the different time and length scales of the chemical supply chain, which means a good understanding of how phenomena at a smaller length-scale relates to properties and behaviour at a longer length-scale, from the molecular and active aggregates-scales up to the production-scales (i.e. the design of a refinery or of a cement or phosphate production complex from the Schrödinger's equations.). The success of this integrated multiscale approach for process innovation (the 3rd paradigm of chemical engineering) is mainly due to the considerable developments in the analytical scientific techniques coupled with image processing, in the powerful computational tools and capabilities (clusters, supercomputers, cloud computers, graphic processing units, numerical codes parallelization etc.) and in the development and application of descriptive models of steady state and dynamic behaviour of the objects at the scale of interest. This modern scientific multiscale approach of chemical engineering "" the green approach of process engineering "" that combines both market pull and technology push is strongly oriented on process intensification and on the couple green products/green processes ""to produce much more and better in using much less"", and to sustainabily produce molecules and products responding to environmental and economic challenges, with the help of technical innovation and sustainable technologies for efficient mass and energy utilization and for a better quality of life: This modern green approach of chemical and process engineering will concern the eco-efficient ""Factory of Future"".",Charpentier J.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Engineering,2016-01-01,Laboratoire Réactions et Génie des Procédés (LRGP),Factory of future ;  Green Chemical Engineering ;  Integrated time and length multiscale approach ;  Process Innovation ;  Process Intensification ;  Product design and engineering
Plant Profitability Improvement Thanks to Production Team and Engineering Offices Synergy: A Case Study in Prayon Production Site,"Phosphoric acid production is a well-known and mature technology but still has room for improvement and innovation. In that respect, the permanent exchanges between process engineers of plant and design offices are of great value. In the Prayon production site of Engis, we have both and achieve permanent plant improvement due to communication between the divisions. The production plant operates under the Central Prayon Process in operation for more than 40 years. It is a dihydrate-hemihydrate process producing an acid of 32-36% P2O5 with efficiency higher than 98% and a high quality calcium sulfate valorized in the plaster industry. Considering our client requirements, the quality of the calcium sulfate needs to be followed with great care and cannot suffer any deviation. The Prayon tilting pan hemihydrate filter needs to be permanently at its best. The P2O5 content in the calcium sulfate (with a maximum limit at 0.6%) must be carefully controlled during all operation time. Therefore, cleanness of the clothes has to be constantly kept as best as possible to ensure the plant capacity and a maximum P2O5 yield recovery. Moreover, cell cleaning operation must be reduced in order to limit the maintenance and the shut-down costs. To tackle these challenges, a joint team of Prayon production plant, Profile and Prayon Technologies has been established. The cake wash water flow has been optimized in order to improve the cake washing efficiency and minimize the P2O5 losses. Furthermore, a new high pressure oscillating ramp has been designed to greatly improve the cloth wash. Finally, new two parts cell bottom has been implemented for easy removal and cleaning of the filter cell bottom. Overall it allows the Engis plant to save 400 hours of maintenance per year, to lower the shut-down time for cells and clothes cleaning of 2 days per year and to recover 850 tons of P2O5 per year by efficiency improvement.",Van Lierde N.; Beckers L.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Engineering,2016-01-01,Phosphoric Acid Plant Prayon S.a.;PRAYON S.A,cake wash water flow ;  cell ;  cloth wash ramp ;  Phosphoric acid ;  tilting pan filter

Teaching and learning innovations on blackboard: What form and function?,"This study is an Information and Computer Technology evaluation of the Blackboard Learning Management System into teaching and learning at an institution of higher education in South Africa. In view of the institution's objective of developing a context-driven, transformative, and innovative teaching and learning practices involving the integration of technology, the study sought to classify and evaluate the form and function of teaching and learning innovations on Blackboard. Using a case study research design and a purposive sampling strategy, lecturers making an extensive use of Blackboard in the delivery of their courses were sampled. Blackboard start-up documents provided qualitative data which were analysed thematically. The functional pedagogical framework and SAMR models were used as interpretive lenses for the findings. The study concludes that the nature of Blackboard innovations tended to be more on substitution and augmentation with limited transformation evidenced by modification and redefinition. With respect to the functions served by Blackboard, the conclusion drawn is that the integration is to a large extent driven by management and efficiency concerns and less by interaction, collaboration and personalisation functions. The study recommends a differentiated approach to Blackboard training by a multi-disciplinary team.",Nkonki V.; Ntlabathi S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Conference on e-Learning, ICEL",2016-01-01,University of Fort Hare,Blackboard ;  ICT integration ;  Innovation ;  Learning management systems ;  Transformation ;  Transformational learning
Enacting artifact-based activities for social technologies in language learning using a design-based research approach,"This paper presents the results of a three-year design-based research (DBR) study on the use of social technologies for collaborative construction of shareable artifacts by groups of learners. The study builds on the learning theory of constructionism which assumes that knowledge is better gained when students find this knowledge for themselves while engaging in the making of concrete and public artifacts. In an attempt to infuse elements of constructionism in the use of social technologies, we tasked groups of learners in language learning courses with collaborative construction of an artifact using social technologies. A unique characteristic of our approach is that the process that students adopted and the way technology and context fostered this procedure was analyzed. The cycle of DBR fueled deep insights into the learning processes that emerged through the construction of an artifact, thus deepening our understanding of the multimode and multi-trajectory relationship between theory, artifact construction and social technologies. For sustaining and orchestrating social construction of artifacts by groups of learners, a set of instructional elements emerged, as well as implications for enacting social technology innovations in real-life classrooms.",Parmaxi A.; Zaphiris P.; Ioannou A.,Journal,Computers in Human Behavior,2016-01-01,Cyprus University of Technology,Computer-assisted language learning (CALL) ;  Information and communication technologies (ICTs) ;  Social computing ;  Social media ;  Web 2.0
ICT tools usage's effectiveness by communities of practice in promoting knowledge management innovation,"We live in a globalised world where knowledge is obtainable on the internet at the press of a button. As a result of this globalisation and ease of access to knowledge on the internet, knowledge economies have emerged in some parts of the world. In these economies, organisations have become aware that is it not enough to merely compete with one another on the basis of financial strength; and that knowledge is the new competitive advantage and differentiator. Knowledge management is the key to power, because it is a significant factor for the strategic survival of organisations. Furthermore, knowledge management is identified as a framework for creating organisational strategy, structures and processes so that it can use what an organisation knows to learn and create economic and social value for itself and its stakeholders. The purpose of this study was to investigate how effective Communities of Practice (CoP) use ICT tools when promoting innovation in knowledge management by looking at a specific ICT tool, Knowbie, and a specific CoP, which in this case was a software development team of a mining company. To meet this purpose, the study purposed three research questions. One of the findings to these questions is that the team does not know if the use of Knowbie is effective in promoting innovation in the way that knowledge is managed in the company. A further finding is that they do not use Knowbie. The study concluded that since the specific CoP does not use the specific ICT tool the effectiveness of its use in promoting innovation in the way that knowledge is managed cannot be determined.",Bandlow K.; Buckley S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Conference on e-Learning, ICEL",2016-01-01,University of South Africa,Communities of practice ;  ICT tools ;  Knowledge management ;  Mining company ;  Software development team

Performance-based pay: alternative interpretations of the Portsmouth Block Mills’ savings,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to describe and analyse a historic performance-based pay system used in 1803-1810 to reward Marc Isambard Brunel for his innovative engineering designs used in the Portsmouth Block Mills. This was used to ensure that Brunel would continue his work on the project once the design was complete to resolve any problems and make any desirable improvements to the machines and the system as a whole. Design/methodology/approach: This research analyses archived correspondence between the project’s initiators: the Navy Board and Samuel Bentham along with the Admiralty as well as Marc Brunel. Basic financial analyses are applied to the historic cost and investment data. Findings: The scheme was well designed and successfully kept Brunel involved in the implementation and operational phases of the project. However, there were numerous problems that delayed the project’s completion, thereby creating additional work for Brunel and also delaying and reducing his payments. Brunel was alienated by these developments. Research limitations/implications: This research has exploited the archived data as fully as possible, and although there are no known deficiencies in the records, it would be desirable to have more complete and detailed information on the investment in, and operations of, the factory. Practical implications: Reward systems should be designed and implemented so that events outside management’s and worker’s control should not disadvantage either group. Originality/value: Detailed information about the operations and financial performance of an early factory are analysed in depth. These reveal how management and an innovative engineer interacted regularly over several years with numerous insights on their day-to-day relations.",Wilson J.,Journal,Journal of Management History,2016-01-01,Adam Smith Business School,Innovation ;  Manufacturing systems ;  Marc Isambard Brunel ;  Performance based pay ;  United Kingdom ;  Work motivation

Innovation in Product-Service System Engineering Based on Early Customer Integration and Prototyping,"Product-Service Systems (PSS) enhance product-centered offers with services and infrastructure in order to provide customer-oriented solutions. These new concepts enable companies to innovate their portfolio, thus supporting creative and adaptable solutions [1]. One of the major challenges is the integrated development of both tangible products and intangible services in respect to their interdependencies. For this reason researchers proposed a versatile set of methods and tools regarding the development of PSS. Nevertheless, two discrepancies can be stated: Firstly, prototyping has been studied inadequately in PSS research so far. For this reason Exner et al. proposed new approaches to fill this gap [2], including remarks to further proceed research with different degrees of technological utilization. Secondly, although customer-orientation and customer integration has been recognized as crucial for PSS, the involvement of clients or consumers in the design process is often disregarded. Consequently, this paper presents an extensive literature research regarding active customer integration and prototyping in PSS design processes. Based on these insights a concept for a new PSS prototyping approach is introduced. The method focuses on PSS concept development including the integration of the customer to evaluate and develop the concepts with intuitive touch technologies.",Exner K.; Damerau T.; Stark R.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2016-01-01,Technische Universität Berlin;Fraunhofer Institute for Production Systems and Design Technology IPK,customer integration ;  design ;  innovation ;  Product-Service Systems ;  prototyping ;  PSS
"The development, commercialization, and impact of optical coherence tomography","This review was written for the special issue of IOVS to describe the history of optical coherence tomography (OCT) and its evolution from a nonscientific, historic perspective. Optical coherence tomography has become a standard of care in ophthalmology, providing real-time information on structure and function – diagnosing disease, evaluating progression, and assessing response to therapy, as well as helping to understand disease pathogenesis and create new therapies. Optical coherence tomography also has applications in multiple clinical specialties, fundamental research, and manufacturing. We review the early history of OCT describing how research and development evolves and the important role of multidisciplinary collaboration and expertise. Optical coherence tomography had its origin in femtosecond optics, but used optical communications technologies and required advanced engineering for early OCT prototypes, clinical feasibility studies, entrepreneurship, and corporate development in order to achieve clinical acceptance and clinical impact. Critical advances were made by early career researchers, clinician scientists, engineering experts, and business leaders, which enabled OCT to have a worldwide impact on health care. We introduce the concept of an ‘‘ecosystem’’ consisting of research, government funding, collaboration and competition, clinical studies, innovation, entrepreneurship and industry, and impact – all of which must work synergistically. The process that we recount is long and challenging, but it is our hope that it might inspire early career professionals in science, engineering, and medicine, and that the clinical and research community will find this review of interest.",Fujimoto J.; Swanson E.,Journal,Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science,2016-01-01,MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,Femtosecond optics ;  Ophthalmic imaging ;  Optical coherence tomography ;  Optics
"Prevalence, prevention, and pedagogical techniques: Academic integrity and ethical professional practice among stem students","Although work in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields underlies the innovations that characterize living in the age of information, some research points to a public distrust of science and technology. While distrust may partly result from larger social trends, the public’s trust in science also relies on the integrity of individuals in STEM fields. Most often academic integrity is discussed in terms of cheating and plagiarism violations. However, given the need for STEM professionals to act ethically, any definition of academic integrity in STEM should reflect professional standards for ethical practice. This chapter reviews these standards and discusses how they can inform conceptualizations of and policies around academic integrity in STEM education. The chapter also explores the prevalence of and causes underlying academic integrity violations in STEM and examines the methods for promoting academic integrity among STEM students. The chapter concludes by identifying research directions that may inform efforts to promote integrity among STEM students and professionals.",Gilmore J.; Maher M.; Feldon D.,Book,Handbook of Academic Integrity,2016-01-01,Utah State University;University of Missouri-Kansas City;Charleston County School District,
Introduction,"Fly ash, a by-product from thermal power plant, is profusely available for several bulk applications as a civil engineering construction material and is very well known to the society around the globe since last three to four decades. Much of the fly ash is still lying unused in various thermal power plants and instigates daily various problems on the earth and the environmental. To deal with such issues, this book presents a new area of fly ash reuse/application as absorbent based on its physical, chemical, mineralogical and morphological characteristics, suitable for alkali activation of the fly ash. Several researchers have opined on such activations by conventional methods for zeolitization of the fly ash. Accordingly, this book is focused to compile all such inferences of the state-of-the-art, further challenges ahead, need of innovations for synthesis of higher grade of fly ash zeolites and their applications for environmental cleanup. Attempts have been made in this book to identify a suitable fly ash type for its effective zeolitization and to develop a novel ""three step activation techniques"" for this purpose with focus on reuse of any by-products. Based on various applications of the fly ash zeolites as absorbent and/or adsorbent and associated environmental safety, brief scope of the further research on fly ash has also been highlighted.",,Book Series,Advanced Structured Materials,2016-01-01,,Absorbent ;  Applications ;  Fly ash ;  Fly ash zeolites ;  Innovations
Formative Assessment and Professional Training: Reflections from a Mathematics course in Bioengineering,"Bioengineering is currently considered an interdisciplinary professional field which provides solutions to different problems arising in the area of health care. Its strategic importance is widely acknowledged since its developments and proposals could help diminish the level of technological dependence in the sector. The fast pace of innovation in the area of biomedical technology gives rise to permanent reflection on the learning goals and teaching strategies proposed by educators in the different training stages of a bioengineer. In this context, learning assessment appears as a controversial issue which needs to be debated and rethought. This paper describes the reflections of teachers of a Mathematics course within a Bioengineering program around the question, What approach to assessment favors the student's participation, autonomy and training as a future bioengineer?

DEA environmental assessment (II): A literature study,"This chapter systematically summarizes previous research efforts, including concepts and methodologies, on DEA environmental assessment applied to energy in the past three decades. Industrial developments are very important for all nations in terms of their economic prosperities. The problem is that the development produces various pollutions on air, water and others types of contaminations, all of which are usually associated with our health problems and climate changes. Thus, it is necessary for us to think how to make a balance between economic success and pollution mitigation in order to maintain a high level of social and corporate sustainability in the world. It is widely considered among researchers and practitioners that DEA is one of methodologies to examine the level of sustainability. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the importance of DEA in assessing unified (operational and environmental) performance of various entities in public and private sectors by summarizing previous research efforts on environmental assessment. The literature survey in this chapter covers 407 articles on DEA applications in energy and environment. It is true that DEA is not a perfect methodology, rather being an approximation methodology for performance assessment. The methodology has strengths and drawbacks in applications. Therefore, it is very important for us to carefully use DEA for guiding large policy and business strategies regarding the global warming and climate change. An underlying premise of this study is that technology innovation in engineering may solve the pollution and climate problem by linking it with economic and business concerns. The DEA provides such a linkage between engineering and social science, so enhancing the practicality in mitigating environmental pollutions. It is envisioned that the literature study, along with a summary on conceptual and methodological developments discussed in Chap. 16, provides researchers and individuals who are interested in social and corporate sustainability with analytical and methodological guidelines for their future research works on DEA environmental assessment.",Sueyoshi T.; Yuan Y.,Book Series,International Series in Operations Research and Management Science,2016-01-01,New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology,
"Managing metadata for science, technology and innovation studies: The RISIS case","Here, we describe the RISIS-SMS metadata system, developed to support the use of heterogeneous datasets in the field of Science, Technology and Innovation Studies (STIS). These data are partly within the RISIS infrastructure, but often elsewhere. The system has three aims: (i) to help researchers to search for and understand data that will help to answer specific research questions, without having to access or download the data. As datasets often have restricted access, browsing metadata is a key feature of the system: researchers need help identifying the relevant data from different sources for their research, and for which data it is worthwhile asking for access; (ii) to support the enrichment of data By linking the metadata system to the Linked Open Data environment (LOD); (iii) to facilitate application-driven data integration.",Idrissou A.; Khalili A.; Hoekstra R.; Van Den Besselaar P.,Conference Proceeding,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2016-01-01,Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam;Universiteit van Amsterdam,Digital humanities ;  Linked data ;  Metadata ;  Research infrastructures ;  Science & technology studies
Chances for urban electromobility: Field test of intermodal travel system and effect on usage intention,"With growing cities, challenges of climate change, and ambitions for energy transition, innovations in urban mobility are inevitable. On the one hand, fossil-fueled vehicles are polluting the cities and could be substituted with electric cars. On the other hand, the sheer number of vehicles has to decrease and public transport needs to be enhanced. A possible solution addressing all challenges in one fully integrated concept is “Mobility Broker”, which combines electric car and bike sharing with public transport in one intermodal traveling system. However, adoption and changes in mobility behavior are crucial for implementing new concepts. In this research, a prototype evaluation by 10 participants using the system for 2 months is presented. The usability of the system as well as the change in attitudes and usage intention before and after the hands-on experience is analyzed. The overall evaluation for intermodal traveling was positive but usability and a reliable infrastructure are crucial factors for usage adoption.",Himmel S.; Zaunbrecher B.; Ziefle M.; Beutel M.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2016-01-01,Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen,Bike sharing ;  Car-sharing ;  Field test ;  Future mobility ;  Usability
User experience design for Green IT products through wearable computing and Quantified Self,"Green IT products collect personal small data by wearable computing and Quantified Self, Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Everything (IoE) link the small data with the big data, and transform the user experience from User-Centered Design (UCD) into User Participated (Involved or engagement) Design (UPD). To collect the seamless and sustainable UPD small data, we use the wearable computing sensors and applications for small data mining, filter, information visualization and interaction design. By information sorting the wearable computing into five types (in me, on me, with me, around me, beyond me), we intend to design the user experience in a sustainable way by Quantified Self. With the context awareness, conscious awareness and emotion awareness, we use LBS (location-based service) to construct context awareness, set up big five personalities and Enneagram to deal with the data of conscious awareness. For the Green IT Products, we set up the eco system information architecture and agile interaction model for the user experience design, we also use pre-conscious, subconscious and conscious awareness big data to analyze and predict the long-term impaction factors for the user experience and users’ intuitive interaction. From the strategy level, structure level, framework level and visual level, we point out the Meaning-Centered Design methodology to dig out the user experience design for the Green IT Products, green and live information architecture for the life cycle evaluation for the Green IT products, figure out the stakeholder and interaction logic moving line by mapping the mental model for the diversified users’ agile transformation needs, emotions and interaction feedback, provide the mass customization and crowds innovation contents to support the Green IT products and Product Service System (PSS), modify the quality of the real physical products and enrich the virtual reality digital information contents to prolong the life cycle of the Green IT Products. By decreasing the carbon footprint and increasing the three flows (information flow, logistics, financial flow) chain touchpoints, we find the painpoints and design the good user experience for the real people. We construct the user engagement innovation platform and transform the users’ function with duality role player with user and designer. For the evaluation of the user experience, we change the scenario role player design into ‘real design for real people’, and with the agile interaction and intuitive interaction, we modify the user experience with the real time high-fidelity prototype and iterative usability testing. In the pilot study, we design the smart clothes and interactive stage, props to collect the dancer’s small data about the heart-beat, EMG, EEG, motion, body gesture, emotion and the audience feedback such as the sound of clapping, the environment light change, the audience moving line and the air smog haze index. We use the module and separate design for the clothes and sensors, memory metal, fiber-optical to balance the clothes light change, clothes form transformation and small data visualization. On the one hand, the clothes can collect the dancer’s action data in an active way, at the same time, the clothes also interact with the dancer, the audience and the stage environment to support the digital contents of the dance. One clothes can express the five scenes of the dance in a sustainable way. And because of the separate design, the clothes and the sensors play the role in a parallel way to leave the dancer plenty of free uncertainty expression space. That win-win design support the real and virtual parts life cycle for the Green IT Products. We use the expert review, heuristic evaluation, big data visual analytics and usability testing for the user experience design evaluation and design the third version for the smart clothes and interactive stage.",Qin J.; Cao S.; Wang X.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2016-01-01,University of Science and Technology Beijing,Interaction design ;  Participatory design ;  Quantified self ;  Small data ;  Smart clothing ;  Wearable computing
Towards a reference framework for Open Source Software adoption,"Nowadays, the use of Open Source Software (OSS) components has become a driver for the primary and secondary information technology (IT) sector, among other factors, by the openness and innovation benefits that can give to the organizations, regardless of its business model and activities' nature. Nevertheless, IT companies and organizations still face numerous difficulties and challenges when making the strategic move to OSS. OSS is aligned with new challenges, which mainly derive from the way OSS is produced and the culture and values of OSS communities. In fact, OSS adoption impacts far beyond technology, because it requires a change in the organizational culture and reshaping IT decision-makers mindset. Therefore, this research work proposes a framework to support OSS adopters (i.e., software-related organizations that develop software and/or offer services relate to software) to analyze and evaluate the impact of adopting OSS as part of their software products and/or services offered to their customers/users, mainly in terms of their software related activities.",Tapia L.; Ayala C.; López L.,Conference Proceeding,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2016-01-01,Universitat Politécnica de Catalunya,Business model ;  Innovation ;  Open Source Software ;  OSS adoption strategies
Information systems for innovation: A comparative analysis of maturity models’ characteristics,"Nowadays, virtually all industries are impacted by the digitalization of business enabled by information and communication technologies. Consequently, it is a major challenge to any business to increase its ability to innovate through information systems. However the effort and the investments of companies are extremely varied, they do not have the same level of maturity with respect to their innovation strategy. While some highly mature use effective approaches, others still act as novices or use inadequate practices. The question raised in this paper is how to evaluate the level of maturity of an organization with respect to information systems based innovation. Also, the question concerns the identification of the salient features of ICT centred innovation maturity models. Taking these issues into account, the paper makes the following contributions: (i) a review of sixteen innovation maturity models collected from the research and the practitioners community, gathering facts about the models and about their effectiveness; (ii) a comparative analysis of these models.",Achi A.; Salinesi C.; Viscusi G.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing,2016-01-01,École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne;Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne,Assessment maturity model ;  Capability maturity ;  Innovation capacity ;  Innovation engineering ;  Innovation maturity models ;  Maturity model
To specificity of discourse approach for engineering students listening comprehension training in ELT classroom,"Spoken English listening comprehension has become mandatory in the fields of science and technology. The innovations in higher education require a high level of students' English listening comprehension because of the increased amount of lectures on special subjects delivered in English. However, of the four skills (reading, writing, listening and speaking) listening is the least researched and valued. Problems in listening require new approaches resulting in developing special educational strategies. The article is aimed at discussing the relevant prosody and intonation markers in the speech of a lecturer as additional AIDS to understand the content of the oral scientific discourse. The following indicators have been chosen by the authors of the article as the most observable means of the speaker's intention to convey the message: the tone change at the beginning of a new paragraph; emphasizing the key words and word-combinations; intonation changes to transfer the known and new information. The tests examining the students' abilities to recognize the prosody and intonation features in the oral scientific discourse were performed. Students' training was organized to study the ways of listening comprehension improvement, and positive results were received. The article underlines the importance of teaching students to know the role of prosody and intonation as supplementary AIDS of understanding the meaning. Teaching methods, the instruments for objective visualization of intonation markers and creation of visual training materials are introduced in the article.",Boitsova E.; Bogach N.; Vylegzhanina K.,Conference Proceeding,Engineering for Rural Development,2016-01-01,Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University,Engineering students ;  English teaching ;  Listening comprehension ;  Oral scientific discourse ;  Pragmatic approach ;  Stress and intonation markers ;  Visualization
Development of new testers to improve quality for data transmissions in intrusion and hold-up alarm systems,"Development of new measuring and security technology is always needed and will be to improve the current situation because of the increased safety for I&HAS (intrusion and hold-up alarm systems) or their control. The Czech University of Life Sciences Prague was to increase the safety of I&HAS developed testers. These testers are used for testing of data transfers in I&HAS. Also devices have been developed for enhancing security of wireless transmissions in I&HAS. It increases protection by revealing the jamming wireless bands outside of standard monitored sites. This research and development are guided primarily because it is a security branch in the stage of stagnation, and it is essential that there is continuous innovation and research in this field of science. New security features or upgrades to the existing features in security systems were solved on the basis of the current state of development of the current testers. When developing new technologies grants also help us as well as personal experience with real installation, cooperation with manufacturers (or with distributors) of security systems and a testing ground for current security features.",Hart J.; Hartova V.,Conference Proceeding,Engineering for Rural Development,2016-01-01,Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,Development ;  Improve ;  Jamming ;  Loop ;  Resistor ;  Tester ;  Wireless

Ontology learning for open semantic TRIZ in software engineering,"TRIZ (the theory of inventive problem solving; an acronym for the Russian phrase ""Teoriya Resheniya Izobretatelskikh Zadatch"") is a broad title representing a collection of methodologies, tools, knowledge bases, and model-based technologies for generating inventive ideas and solutions. It has been developed for over 65 years to support engineers and natural scientists solving problems in the fields of physics, chemistry and mechanical systems by using knowledge of former inventors. In today business environment, new technologies and competitions force business organizations to invest additional resources in order to continuously improve their business models, products, processes, services, management, information system and knowledge of employees. As a part of these efforts, appears an exigency for strengthening the importance of inventive solving problems capabilities in area of software engineering, supporting innovative aspects of business organizations in extremely changing environment. Although the software engineering (SE) is ""a branch of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, and maintenance of complex computer programs"", the existing research shows that only a part of the available TRIZ toolkit is applicable to this specific field. The current literature records numerous attempts made in different directions in order to fulfil a prominence need for adjustment, widening or upgrading existing TRIZ methodology to SE domain. This article synthetizes those efforts and proposes the development of semantic portal for open TRIZ in supporting collaborative software engineers' inventive problem solving process. As a part of this development process, authors have offered a solution for facilitating the ontology acquisition activities using inductive learning.",Bevanda V.; Sinković G.; Turk M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 9th IADIS International Conference Information Systems 2016, IS 2016",2016-01-01,Juraj Dobrila University of Pula,Ontology learning and collaborative knowledge management platform ;  Open innovation ;  Semantic web ;  Software engineering ;  TRIZ inventive principles
When engineering and design students collaborate: The case of a website development workshop,"Designers are often characterized by their creativity, whereas engineers are often characterized by their analytical thinking style. Both capabilities are vital in the new economic era, particularly for innovation. Thus, the collaboration between designers and engineers is crucial and should be fostered by academia and industry. Our preliminary research examined perceptions and interactions among 14 students in engineering, art and design programs during a website development workshop. The research indicates that students enjoyed the experience and found it educational and socially engaging. The data collected through questionnaires and observations were qualitatively analyzed, revealing that students learned each other’s jargon, conducted discussions that addressed both technological and design concerns and considered various opinions leading to joint decision making. Importantly, one of the teams was invited to continue development of its project in an entrepreneurship accelerator program. This study sheds light on the potential of multidisciplinary teams in development processes in general and in website development processes in particular.",Levy M.; Shlomi Y.; Etzioni Y.,Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2016-01-01,Shenkar College of Engineering and Design Israel,Multidisciplinary collaboration ;  Qualitative research ;  Website development
The Relationship of Individual Capabilities and Environmental Support with Different Facets of Designers' Innovative Behavior,"Theoretical perspectives on employee creativity have tended to focus on an individual's capability to generate original and potentially useful ideas, whereas definitions of innovation also include the process of putting those new ideas into practice. This field study therefore set out to test how theoretically distinct types of individual knowledge and skills are related to different aspects of employees' innovative behavior in terms of both their new idea generation and idea implementation. Using a sample of design engineers (n = 169) in a multinational engineering company, measures were taken of different aspects of innovative work behavior (patent submission, real-time idea submission, idea implementation) and a range of individual capabilities (creativity-relevant skills, job expertise, operational skills, contextual knowledge, and motivation) and environmental features (job control, departmental support for innovation). Analyses showed that creativity-relevant skills were positively related to indices of idea generation but not to idea implementation. Instead, employees' job expertise, operational skills, and motivation to innovate demonstrated a stronger role in idea implementation. In terms of environmental factors, job control showed no positive relationship with innovative work behavior while departmental support for innovation was related to employees' idea generation but not idea implementation. The theoretical perspective that correlates of idea generation differ in certain aspects to those for idea implementation are confirmed by the study. Practical implications for organizations wishing to improve their innovativeness are discussed in terms of tailored training, development, motivational, and environmental interventions designed to improve the capabilities of individuals to engage in all parts of the innovation process.",Birdi K.; Leach D.; Magadley W.,Journal,Journal of Product Innovation Management,2016-01-01,Sheffield University Management School,
An integration model for innovative products in Korea and China: Bio-based smart clothing,"In order to analyse users' acceptance of an innovative product in the information age, this study investigates the relationships among perceived ease of use, usefulness, enjoyment, and purchase intention of smart clothing based on bio-signal. This study considers the fashion innovation and technology innovation to understand potential users' characteristics of innovative products. To achieve objectives of this study, we carry out the survey targeting reading groups, and providing them with pictures of biomedical smart clothes. Perceived ease of use and benefit had a positive effect on the purchase intention in Korea, but did not have an effect on the purchase intention in China. The results of the difference analysis shows that the fashion innovation perceiving the Chinese customers had a greater impact the perceived ease of use and usefulness than the Korea customers.

Catalysts for design thinking and engineering thinking: Fostering Ambidextrous Mindsets for Innovation,"Design transforms people and the stuff they make. How technical engineers learn and advance a human-centered design approach, and what catalysts for their learning exist, is illustrated with research done with student mechanical engineering designers engaged in work practice. Ambidextrous Mindsets for Innovation is a framework for relating designerly ways of knowing-doing-acting and engineering ways of knowing-doing-acting. Several emergent themes have arisen as supports to the students successfully adapting a design thinking and prototyping culture based on the researcher's observations of student teams. These observations have revealed some catalysts for student learning. They are facilitated by a situative zeitgeist-a close proximity to other groups in a shared design space or project loft, scaffolded prototyping-a series of front-loaded prototype milestone assignments, cognitive iteration-a practice of encouraging reflection on what is gained from prototyping, and cognitive apprenticeship-learning aided by repeatedly stepping through the steps of the design process. These practices and local customs improve the students' learning experiences.",Lande M.,Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2016-01-01,Ira A.

The development of 21st century skills in the knowledge building environment,"Many of the most important problems facing engineers today have solutions that require not only technical expertise, but also the application of 21st century skills. Knowledge building (KB) is an instructional approach designed to support both deep learning and the development of these skills. In KB learners engage in a sustained discourse to share knowledge, formulate and refine inquiries, and continually improve their collective ideas and understanding of authentic problems. This paper presents an example of applyingKBin an undergraduate engineering mechanics course. Data from 77 students engaging inKBand the discourse record of aKBteam consisting of 8 students was examined to look for indications of 21st century skill development. Evidence was found supporting high-level creativity and innovation, communication, collaboration/teamwork, information literacy/research, critical thinking and metacognition skills. The discourse also provided evidence that the class was centered on the learner, knowledge, community, and assessment - all best practices for designing learning environments.",Ellis G.; Zhang Y.,Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2016-01-01,Smith College,21st century skills ;  Assessment ;  Knowledge building ;  Learning environment

Design Support for Maintenance Tasks using TRIZ,"Design for Maintenance is a method to optimize maintenance activities during the design process. To help maintenance engineers, the chair Maintenance Engineering at the University of Twente has set up a list of 37 guidelines. However, these guidelines only state the goal that should be achieved, but do not define the actions that should be taken to solve maintenance-related problems during the design phase. TRIZ is a product and process innovation method that uses various tools that propose paths to possible innovations and solutions. As such, TRIZ promises it could be a useful addition to the existing set of 37 maintenance guidelines. In this research the compatibility of TRIZ and maintenance guidelines is explored using a 3 stage research plan. Firstly, applicable guidelines are linked to TRIZ methods. In a second step these links are grouped and generalized so not every maintenance guideline also needs a unique TRIZ strategy. Finally a roadmap is presented that helps during Design for Maintenance activities in solving maintenance problems with the support of TRIZ tools.",Vaneker T.; Van Diepen T.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2016-01-01,Universiteit Twente,Design for Maintenance ;  Maintenance ;  TRIZ
Application of TRIZ in Building Industry: Study of Current Situation,"This article is focused on literature review in the area of TRIZ application in building industry. TRIZ is the Russian acronym for the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving which can be presented as a methodology for problem-solving, ideas-generating and forecasting in innovation, based on logic and data. The theory has been widely used in many fields since early 2000s when innovation became an integral part of the modern World. Despite that, the analysis showed that the number of publications related to application of TRIZ in construction is less than 2% out of all TRIZ-related studies in the SCOPUS database. The paper is organized in the following order: introduction into the topic, the principle of obtaining the dataset for the review, Short description of TRIZ and its possible application in construction, discussion of demand of innovation in building industry and the main body consisting of TRIZ in Development of Construction Techniques and Technologies, TRIZ in Design of New Structures and Construction Materials and TRIZ in Construction Project Management and Value Engineering. The work ends with conclusion, suggestion for future work and acknowledgment. Overall, 28 scientific works regarding application of TRIZ in building industry were discovered and reviewed in this paper. The study reveals that TRIZ usage in construction is still quite limited. The further research will adapt classic TRIZ tools for construction engineering and management and provide a number of specific case studies.",Renev I.; Chechurin L.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2016-01-01,LUT University,building industry ;  construction ;  innovation ;  TRIZ
Services Evaluation and Improvement with Systematic Innovation Tools,"In the decades, systematic innovation has been enriched of techniques that help people in continuous/disruptive product/service improvement. Products benefit from more tools than services, but even in those scientific papers and practitioner contributions are drawing a viable path. Authors gave their contribution in this field sharing an experience in logistics innovation: one interesting outcome was a method that brought personnel with average technical knowledge to solve problems with a relatively simple method derived by TRIZ and Axiomatic Design. One evidence was that people need few techniques to solve most of problems provided these were well stated, so that the work left open the following issue: ""what important to invest in? Problem solving tools or problem formulation ones?"" So some approach with the aim of evaluating the innovation gap of a service and formulating the problems that must solved to fill those gaps are investigated in this paper. The paper starts its analysis from the definition of a service though its intangibility, then it investigates how LESE (Laws of Engineering Systems Evolution) can be used to identify improvement paths and, eventually, it proposes a selection of Inventive Standards suitable for service improvement and innovation. The evaluator can perform an exhaustive analysis or a rough one depending on she/he is looking for quick idea of service maturity level or needs to define a complete problem solving work to assign to a project team. This contribution on systematic service innovation aims to stimulate a debate on the more promising research directions on next years' service innovation research.",Angelini C.; Cascini G.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2016-01-01,Politecnico di Milano;Posteitaliane,
Application of 1:1 mobile learning scenarios in computer engineering education,"The paper aims at presenting case study on personalised mobile learning scenarios on Computer Engineering and other STEM subjects in Lithuania. Fleming (VARK) learning styles model was used to personalise Creative Classrooms Lab (CCL) project's mobile learning scenarios by establishing suitable learning components for particular students according to their personal needs. Personalised mobile learning scenarios were compared against traditional ""one size fits all"" learning scenarios. Comparison was performed on the base of the analysis of Lithuanian CCL teachers' answers on questionnaire during the 2nd cycle of CCL project implementation and previous research results on expert evaluation of these types of learning scenarios. During this cycle, inquiry-based learning (IBL) activities developed in mascil project and a number of mobile applications (apps) were used by Lithuanian teachers while implementing the mobile learning scenarios, and interconnections between personalised IBL sub-activities and mobile apps were established. The authors have also analysed CCL observation visits' final report in terms of learning personalisation, creativity and innovation in schools. Based on this three-fold research, the authors concluded that (a) pedagogical change is necessary to improve learning outcomes for students, and (b) the main success factors in implementing mobile learning scenarios in Lithuania were: (1) identification of students' learning styles; (2) identification and application of suitable learning activities, methods, learning objects, tools and mobile apps according to students' learning styles; and (3) use of proper sets and sequences of learning methods while implementing mobile learning scenarios.",Juskeviciene A.; Jasute E.; Kurilovas E.; Mamcenko J.,Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2016-01-01,Vilniaus Gedimino Technikos Universitetas;Vilniaus Universitetas,CCL project ;  Computer engineering education ;  Educational data mining ;  Inquirybased learning ;  Learning styles ;  Mascil project ;  Mobile learning scenarios ;  Personalised learning ;  Questionnaire for teachers ;  STEM subjects
"Creativity, Learning Techniques and TRIZ","Creativity and innovation are acquiring a foremost importance in the scientific and engineering world. TRIZ offers a systematic approach for problem solving, still it requires creativity abilities when translating the recommendations offered by inventive principles and standard inventive solutions into the specific domain of the problem. Goal of this paper is to show that creativity can be enhanced if the learning process is better understood and how strongly learning and creativity training are linked. The technologist who wants to be a lifelong learner and a creative professional inventor can profit from different techniques that cognitive psychology proved to be effective for learning, like metaphor, story and visualization, focused and diffuse modes of thinking, interleaving and how to overcome Einstellung. Their commonalities and relationships with problem solving approaches will be explained. Different learning techniques can be mapped to already well known TRIZ tools, giving them a neuroscientific foundation. Often TRIZ practitioners in a corporate environment are called to facilitate TRIZ sessions with very little time allocated. Being effective in a short time is crucial to enhance trust and leverage application. Several sessions at GE Global Research Munich offered a chance to compare different approaches and observe how to boost the idea sparking process, even in situations where the facilitator is not a subject matter expert or the inventive team has little or no background in TRIZ.",Bertoncelli T.; Mayer O.; Lynass M.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2016-01-01,GE Global Research - Europe,Brainstorming ;  Creativity ;  Learning ;  TRIZ
Adoption space and the idea-to-market process of health technologies,"Although Europe 'produces' excellent science, it has not been equally successful in translating scientific results into commercially successful companies in spite of European and national efforts invested in supporting the translation process. The Idea-to-Market process is highly complex due to the large number of actors and stakeholders. ITECH was launched to propose recommendations which would accelerate the Idea-to-Market process of health technologies leading to improvements in the competitiveness of the European health technology industry in the global markets. The project went through the following steps: defining the Idea-to-Market process model; collection and analysis of funding opportunities; identification of 12 gaps and barriers in the Idea-to-Market process; a detailed analysis of these supported by interviews; a prioritization process to select the most important issues; construction of roadmaps for the prioritized issues; and finally generating recommendations and associated action plans. Seven issues were classified as in need of actions. Three of these are part of the ongoing Medical Device Directive Reform (MDR), namely health technology assessment, post-market surveillance and regulatory process, and therefore not within the scope of ITECH. Recommendations were made for eHealth taxonomy; Education and training; Clinical trials and Adoption space and Human Factors Engineering (HFE).",Saranummi N.; Beuscart R.; Black N.; Maglaveras N.; Strano C.; Karavidopoulou Y.,Book Series,Studies in Health Technology and Informatics,2016-01-01,Teknologian Tutkimuskeskus VTT;Ulster University;Aristotle University of Thessaloniki;Inserm,Adoption space ;  CE marking ;  Clinical trials ;  Education and training ;  EHealth ;  GMDN ;  Idea-to-Market ;  Innovation ;  Medical devices ;  Regulatory requirements ;  Research & development ;  Taxonomy ;  Transition management ;  User requirements
Ideas for innovation: A systematic mapping of the literature,"This paper attempts to map the specific literature in order to seek better understanding of the current situation on research related to ideas for innovation, enabling to identify how authors treat the activity of managing ideas in the innovation process. In this sense, we adopted a methodological procedure, held from a systematic search, to review the literature on the subject - ideas in the context of innovation. We used the Scopus, Engineering Village, Web of Science and EBSCO databases. As a result, we obtained a corpus of 241 publications, in which we initially identified key articles, authors, countries, and journals that have published more on the subject, and the most frequently used keywords. Subsequently, based on the analysis of these articles, it was possible to perform a taxonomic classification for sort them according to their main focus of research. The taxonomy used consists of management models of ideas; generation and enrichment of ideas; sources of ideas; evaluation and selection of ideas; storage of ideas; sharing of ideas; computational tools for the management of ideas; factors of influence on the management of ideas.",Teza P.; Miguez V.; Fernandes R.; Dandolini G.; De Souza J.,Journal,Corrosion Engineering Science and Technology,2016-01-01,"Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Santa Catarina;Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina",Front end of innovation ;  Innovation ;  Innovation ideas
A Proposal for an Antifragile Software Manifesto,"The disruptive nature of the antifragile approach for open and complex systems is of greatest importance and needs to be systematized, especially for software systems. In fact, antifragile software design is becoming a research issue in the software engineering community. We got inspired by the Agile Manifesto which set an important reference point to the software community, addressing primarily innovation in the software development process. We propose a similar approach to Antifragility, namely we would like to define the principles ruling the building up of software systems which exploit faults and errors to become better and stronger. This Manifesto does not want to be a fixed and complete set of principles. It is an open contribution to the discussion which needs to be improved and re-elaborated. All rights related to the Manifesto are free, open and belong to the community. This work represents our suggestions urging the community to start elaborating antifragile principles to lead their implementation in real organizations.",Russo D.; Ciancarini P.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Computer Science,2016-01-01,Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna,Antifragility ;  Complex Systems ;  Software Engineering
"Inverted learning environments with technology, innovation and flexibility: Student experiences and meanings","Flexibility, technology and innovation can lead to challenging learning environments. The research question: What are students' meanings and experiences in inverted learning environments? The investigation methodology was mixed with three instruments applied to 568 students. Flexible environments, active learning and inverted learning were analyzed. Qualitative and quantitative data were triangulated with instruments, data and theory. The results indicated that (1) university students of flexible environments modified their schedules and learning locations; (2) active learning is related to students' meanings, and; (3) inverted learning experiences confirm that they find a source of learning not only in the teacher figure but also in their peers. Students mentioned learning from videos (77%) has the advantage of flexibility as well as technical problems (34%) as a disadvantage.",Montoya M.; Del Carmen Ramírez Hernández D.,Journal,Journal of Information Technology Research,2016-01-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Active learning ;  Flexible learning ;  Innovation ;  Inverted learning ;  Learning environment ;  Technologies
How service innovation contributes to co-create value in service networks,"The purpose of this paper is to investigate how service innovations (in a living lab context) contribute to co-create value in a service network. Exploratory research is developed using a qualitative approach and case study on mobility services in Bologna. Our findings reveal that the involved entities are able to recombine their existing resources and design a new value proposition based on the ICT solution. Theoretical and empirical research suggests that collaboration and participation in decision making are critical to service system reconfiguration. The study shows the importance of including insights from Service Science Management and Engineering and Design (SSMED) in the management of network theory. Moreover, the research paves the way for new perspectives on analysis of local governance issues based on value co-creation processes in the ICT service solution context. Using this perspective, service innovations in the overall management of public services view a city as a Smart Local Service System (SLSS), whose competitiveness depends on its ability to access and share common resources to create mutual value.",Ciasullo M.; Polese F.; Troisi O.; Carrubbo L.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing,2016-01-01,Università degli Studi di Salerno,Living lab ;  Service innovation ;  Service Science Management and Engineering (SSME) ;  Value co-creation

As a result, we obtained a corpus of 241 publications, in which we initially identified key articles, authors, countries, and journals that have published more on the subject, and the most frequently used keywords. Subsequently, based on the analysis of these articles, it was possible to perform a taxonomic classification for sort them according to their main focus of research. The taxonomy used consists of management models of ideas; generation and enrichment of ideas; sources of ideas; evaluation and selection of ideas; storage of ideas; sharing of ideas; computational tools for the management of ideas; factors of influence on the management of ideas.",Teza P.; Miguez V.; Fernandes R.; Dandolini G.; De Souza J.,Journal,Gestao e Producao,2016-01-01,"Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Santa Catarina;Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina",Front end of innovation ;  Innovation ;  Innovation ideas
"Engineering, global health, and inclusive innovation: Focus on partnership, system strengthening, and local impact for SDGs","The recent drafting of the Sustainable Development Goals challenges the research community to rethink the traditional approach to global health and provides the opportunity for science, technology, engineering, and mathematical (STEM) disciplines, particularly engineering, to demonstrate their benefit to the field. Higher education offers a platform for engineering to intersect with global health research through interdisciplinary partnerships among international universities that provide excellence in education, attract nontraditional STEM students, and foster a sense of innovation. However, a traditional lack of engineering-global health collaborations, as well as limited faculty and inadequate STEM research funding in low-income countries, has stifled progress. Still, the impact of higher education on development efforts holds great potential. This value will be realized in low-income countries through strengthening local capacity, supporting innovation through educational initiatives, and encouraging the inclusion of women and minorities in STEM programs. Current international university-level partnerships are working towards integrating engineering into global health research and strengthening STEM innovation among universities in low-income countries, but more can be done. Global health research informs sustainable development, and through integrating engineering into research efforts through university partnerships, we can accelerate progress and work towards a healthier future for all.",Clifford K.; Zaman M.,Journal,Global Health Action,2016-01-01,Boston University College of Engineering;Howard Hughes Medical Institute,Engineering research ;  Global health technology ;  Higher education ;  International partnerships ;  STEM ;  Sustainable Development Goals

Enabling Radical Innovation through Highly Iterative Product Expedition in Ramp up and Demonstration Factories,"Short development times that are characterized by a high return on engineering (RoE) become increasingly important as a critical success factor for the realization of radical innovation. However, the high degree of complexity of modern products results in a long and costly development time when traditional sequential development processes are employed. The paper at hand describes the restraints of typical gate-oriented product development processes and builds up on recent studies recommending highly iterative innovation processes for the fast realization of physical product ideas. The suggested methodology represents an approach based on the Scrum process model from the software industry that includes the continuous integration of costumers and production engineers based on the execution of feasibility studies by the early and stepwise development of prototypes. In this context, modern ramp up and demonstration factories possessing a product lifecycle management (PLM) system, an integrated ICT infrastructure, interdisciplinary engineering teams and scalable manufacturing technologies are suggested as key enablers. The authors illustrate that these facilities, together with a sensor-based product expedition are particularly suitable for implementing an adapted Scrum process for the development of physical product ideas. A critical reflection on the basis of the development of an electric car aims to underline the suitability of the presented methodology in enabling radical innovation.",Schuh G.; Gartzen T.; Basse F.; Schrey E.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2016-01-01,Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen,Complexity management ;  Highly iterative product development ;  Radical innovation ;  Ramp up ;  Scrum
The Relevance of Manufacturing Flexibility in the Context of Industrie 4.0,"Manufacturing companies have to withstand a growing global competition on different strategic dimensions like production costs, product quality and product innovation. To cope with this increased competition, companies in high-wage countries often employ a differentiation strategy to meet individual customer needs, as it becomes increasingly challenging to justify higher production costs through superior product quality. Manufacturing flexibility as a strategic orientation has been discussed in engineering and management literature for several decades with growing interest in the recent past. As a result of this development, scientific literature has focused on a multitude of topics including flexibility as a reactive and proactive strategy. This paper summarizes the different research streams associated with production flexibility, building on the groundbreaking work of Donald Gerwin [1], who introduced flexibility as a strategic perspective and developed a framework that illustrates the relationship between manufacturing strategy, environmental uncertainty and methods for delivering flexibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify the relationships between flexibility and performance by systematically charting empirical findings from the literature and to link this development to the advancements of manufacturing schemes of Industrie 4.0. We use our findings to allocate the literature stream of production and manufacturing flexibility in the framework of Industrie 4.0, proposed by Schuh et al. [2]. The relevance of the discussed relationships are verified with different research groups in the Cluster of Excellence ""Integrative Production Technology in High-Wage Countries"" of the RWTH Aachen University.",Brettel M.; Klein M.; Friederichsen N.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2016-01-01,Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen,Flexibility ;  Manufacturing ;  Mass customization
Adjusting the Factory Planning Process when Using Immature Technologies,"Due to shorter product-life-cycles, innovations in production engineering have to keep pace with today's technologies. As a result, factory planning is more and more challenged by technologies being immature for series production. Usually, these immature technologies place special demands on production layout and quality management, for example. These demands have to be considered in the factory planning process. Moreover, technologies are part of the production process that is created by a series of technologies. Hence, a planning process has to ensure that the positive aspects of a new technology are not negated by arrangements to protect the technology chain against failure due to immature technologies. With Selective Laser Melting (SLM) used as example for an additive manufacturing technology, this paper presents a method of planning a production system by taking the technology maturity into account. Possible requirements of an immature technology interacting with the process chain will be addressed as well as adjustments to be made to the factory planning process.",Kopf R.; Schlesinger L.; Peters S.; Lanza G.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2016-01-01,Karlsruher Institut für Technologie,3D printing ;  Additive manufacturing ;  Factory planning ;  Selective laser melting ;  Technology maturity
Revamped biomedical engineering curriculum for future-ready graduates,"With the implementation of the compulsory industrial internship for the biomedical engineering (BME) students at the National University of Singapore from July 2016, the Department of Biomedical Engineering had recently made a drastic revamp of its undergraduate curriculum. In our interaction with our students, alumni and industry partners, the feedback had been that our BME curriculum had too many core modules and it would be preferable to have some degree of “specialisation” for our BME undergraduates. The revamped curriculum will consist of (a) the first two years of the 4-year undergraduate BME program will be dedicated to the core courses and (b) the final two years will comprise the compulsory six-month industrial internship, a compulsory design course, a final year project plus eight technical elective courses. The latter will provide the students with more choices of elective courses for them to pursue a pathway of their interest. As an academic advisory to our students, the Department has recommended three pathways in which the students can pursue, namely (a) Engineering Research Pathway, (b) Innovation and Entrepreneurship Pathway and (c) Engineering Professional Pathway. There will be recommended courses for the students to choose under each pathway.",Toh S.,Conference Proceeding,IFMBE Proceedings,2016-01-01,National University of Singapore,Biomedical engineering ;  Curriculum ;  Education ;  Future-ready ;  Graduates
Continuous regional analysis device for neonate lung (CRADL),"Each year 15 million babies are born prematurely and many suffer from respiratory failure due to immaturity of the lung and lack of control of breathing. Although respiratory support, especially mechanical ventilation, can improve their survival, it may also cause injury to the vulnerable lung resulting in severe and chronic pulmonary morbidity, lasting into adulthood. Heterogeneity of lung aeration, with areas of over inflation and collapse, plays a crucial part in the mortality and morbidity due to respiratory failure. This regionally different distribution of lung aeration cannot be detected by currently available bedside monitoring tools and imaging methods. Thus, an imaging technique for continuous non-invasive bedside monitoring of infants´ lung function is urgently needed. In order to address this, CRADL will use EIT technology to establish a tool for monitoring regional lung function and to guide interventions in the paediatric population. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a non-radiative, inexpensive technique that can facilitate real time monitoring of lung aeration, and recent studies have shown that it is effective in monitoring aeration in preterm babies. CRADL will show how EIT can provide new cost effective, easy to use, respiratory management tools and clinical protocols that can be universally adopted to reduce deaths and disability in preterm babies by delivering a clinical device that provides continuous, non-invasive, radiation free, bedside information on regional lung aeration and ventilation during daily clinical care of (preterm) infants and children with respiratory failure. CRADL will also assess the effectiveness, efficacy and safety of such a system in guiding respiratory management and supportive care of the most common causes of paediatric respiratory failure (respiratory distress syndrome, bronchiolitis and acute respiratory distress syndrome), with the final goal of reducing short and long term adverse effects of disease and side effects of its treatment.

QR codes in education and communication,"Technological advances brought applications of innovations to education. Conventional education increasingly flourishes with new technologies accompanied by more learner active environments. In this continuum, there are learners preferring self-learning. Traditional learning materials yield attractive, motivating and technologically enhanced learning materials. The QR (Quick Response) Codes are one of these innovations. The aim of this study is to redesign a lesson unit supported with QR Codes and to get the learner views about the redesigned material. For this purpose, the redesigned lesson unit was delivered to 15 learners in Balikesir University in the academic year of 2013-2014. The learners were asked to study the material. The learners who had smart phones and Internet access were chosen for the study. To provide sectional diversity, three groups were created. The group learners were from Faculty of Education, Faculty of Science and Literature and Faculty of Engineering. After the semi-structured interviews were held, the learners were asked about their pre-knowledge about QR Codes, QR Codes' contribution to learning, difficulties with using QR Codes about and design issues. Descriptive data analysis was used in the study. The findings were interpreted on the basis of Theory of Diffusion of Innovations and Theory of Uses and Gratifications. After the research, the themes found were awareness of QR Code, types of QR Codes and applications, contributions to learning, and proliferation of QR Codes. Generally, the learners participating in the study reported that they were aware of QR Codes; that they could use the QR Codes; and that using QR Codes in education was useful. They also expressed that such features as visual elements, attractiveness and direct routing had positive impact on learning. In addition, they generally mentioned that they did not have any difficulty using QR Codes; that they liked the design; and that the content should include both superficial and in-depth information.",Durak G.; Ozkeskin E.; Ataizi M.,Journal,Turkish Online Journal of Distance Education,2016-01-01,Anadolu Üniversitesi;Balikesir Üniversitesi,Communication ;  Distance education ;  Mobile learning ;  QR code

A Novel Framework for Achieving Sustainable Value Creation Through Industrial Engineering Principles,"Due to the lack of suitable approaches for sustainable development, over the years, a gap has evolved between the developed and emerging countries on innovation and technological development. At the same time, opportunities for value creation call for a collaborative framework for economic, environmental, and social industrial benefits among multiple countries to achieve sustainable value creation. Based on international cooperation in sustainable manufacturing, existing design and assessment methodologies can be adapted to increase innovation by utilizing the dynamics of competition and cooperation. This paper focuses on bridging this gap by implementing an approach for adaptively transforming the industrial engineering education principles and practices with the associated research methodologies from developed countries into manufacturing systems in emerging and developing countries. To achieve this transformative approach for sustainable development through education and research, developed countries promote their best practice education cultures in emerging and developing countries. Based on the need for technological and managerial methodologies for sustainable manufacturing, the set of capabilities for industrial engineering are analyzed, and educational principles are selected. As an example of the approach proposed in this paper, a new reformed program for industrial engineering merges the needs of the Turkish manufacturing industry with the German application-oriented education and research culture. The educational program guides stakeholders to generate a common understanding and utilize bilateral opportunities for sustainable value creation in manufacturing.",Bilge P.; Seliger G.; Badurdeen F.; Jawahir I.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2016-01-01,Stanley and Karen Pigman College of Engineering;Technische Universität Berlin,cooperation in higher education ;  industrial engineering ;  Sustainable value creation
Information systems control: A review and framework for emerging information systems processes,"A major stream of information systems (IS) research examines the topic of control, which focuses on attempts to affect employee behavior as a means to achieve organizational objectives. Despite a rich history of IS control research, approximately 90 percent of the publications focus on only three IS processes: managing information systems development, managing IS outsourcing, and managing security. However, the emergence of new IS processes and technologies with distinct control challenges, such as managing enterprise architecture and managing innovation, highlights a need to consider the wider applicability of past control insights. In this paper, we first integrate existing IS control constructs and relationships into a comprehensive IS control model. Second, we apply this model to emerging IS processes to guide future research and practice. We review 65 influential IS control-related journal papers and identify five control dimensions. We then consolidate these dimensions into a single, integrated model to apply past IS control findings to the challenges of emerging information systems by posing a series of related propositions. With this paper, we position current IS control research to be increasingly applicable and relevant to tomorrow’s emerging IS opportunities and challenges.",Cram W.; Brohman M.; Gallupe R.,Journal,Journal of the Association for Information Systems,2016-01-01,Bentley University;Queen’s University,Control ;  Enterprise architecture ;  Information systems development ;  IS management ;  IS process
Bureaucracy as innovation,"Bureaucracy is a tool like any other, one that must be applied properly to provide a benefit. The success of bureaucracy in one function does not necessarily recommend its full application to all functions. progress, but at the same time it is uninspiring. Its rigid processes and standards take the spark of imagination, lack consideration for the human condition, and do not tolerate change. But bureaucracy can be, and frequently is, misapplied. When its rigid rules are imposed out of context, it can create as many problems as it solves or even stop a good project in its tracks. Finding the balance requires acknowledging that fact and finding ways to limit the reach of bureaucracy where it is not conducive to productivity.",Smith R.,Journal,Research Technology Management,2016-01-01,"BTG, Inc.",
Collaborating with universities and government labs,"Innovative organizations have long recognized the value of collaboration between well-matched partners. The result of this growing interest has been a number of programs and policies intended to facilitate industry collaborations. This shift has significant implications for industry. By leveraging basic research and technology created at federal labs or research universities, companies can reduce sunk costs and risk associated with the early stages of innovation. The first step, of course, is finding an appropriate partner. Typically, this begins with a search to determine who is doing innovative work in a particular field. Many companies will have technology search processes in place to survey such obvious sources as journal articles and conference proceedings.

A comparative analysis for manufacturers to carry out emission reduction through technology innovation across supply chain structures,"In this paper, we consider a two-level supply chain which includes one manufacturer and one retailer. We address the problem of choosing the emission reduction through technology innovation from the manufacturer. Specifically, three options are available to manufacturer: 1) the manufacturer does not carry out the technology innovation: 2) the manufacturer carries out the technology innovation alone; 3) the manufacturer and retailer carry out the technology innovation together. We model the three options described above as systems with the manufacturer or the retailer being the leader of Stackelberg. In this case, we analyse the level of technology innovation and the retailer's cost of sales which have an impact on the profits of supply chain members. We choose a simplified numerical example and get some results. The study shows that joint innovation is not the optimum, because it is affected by the retailer's cost of sales.",Liang X.; Jing S.,Journal,International Journal of Manufacturing Technology and Management,2016-01-01,Chongqing Jiaotong University,Carbon emission ;  Emission reduction ;  Supply chain management ;  Technology innovation

Design and technology: A historical perspective on the mediating role of technology between industrial design and engineering,"The interdisciplinary relationship between industrial design and mechanical engineering is sensitive. This research focuses on understanding how one can positively mediate this relation, in order to foster innovation. In this paper, technology is considered for this role since it has, in some historical moments, served as an integrator of these two disciplines, in processes that led to innovation. By means of an extensive literature review, covering three different periods of technological development, both disciplines' positioning in society and their link with technology are analyzed and compared. The three case studies selected help to illustrate, precisely, the technology positioning between both disciplines and society. Literature assumes that industrial design is rooted in the rise of criticism against both the machine and the mechanized production. This is an opposing approach to the current paradigm, in which design plays a fundamental role in adapting technology to society. Also, the social problems caused by the mechanized and massive production triggered the mechanical engineering emergence, as a professionalized discipline. Technology was intrinsically connected with both industrial design and mechanical engineering emergence and subsequent evolution. In the technology conflict with society lays the reform and regulation for design practice, in its broadest sense.",Figueiredo J.,Journal,International Journal of Design in Society,2016-01-01,Instituto de Ciência e Inovação em Engenharia Mecânica e Engenharia Industrial,Design history ;  Innovation ;  Technology

The Implementation of Phase Changing Materials in Energy-efficient Buildings. Case Study: EFdeN Project,"The EFdeN Project is a research and educational project which has represented Romania at Solar Decathlon Europe 2014 from Versailles, France. The team has consisted of more than 60 students and university researchers from several Romanian universities. The competition involves the participation in ten other sub-contests: architecture, engineering, energy efficiency, electrical energy balance, comfort conditions, house functioning, communication and social awareness, urbanism, innovation and sustainability. In order to obtain the highest score on energy efficiency, electrical energy balance, comfort conditions, innovation and sustainability sub-contests, the EFdeN Project proposed the implementation of several active and passive strategies. These performant and innovative strategies were designed in order to obtain the perfect indoor conditions with minimum energy consumption. One of the most innovative solutions implemented in the EFdeN prothotype was the integration of phase changing materials (PCM) in the building walls. It was determined, by using dynamic simulations, that the impact of PCM type M27/Q23 on the energy reduction for cooling is around 16.72%, while for the heating is negligible. This material has a latent heat storage value of 85 Wh/m2 and a phase change temperature of 23C. We have conducted other tests with different PCM materials and the best one was found to be the PCM type M182/Q23, with a latent heat storage of 574 Wh/m2 and which had a great impact on the energy reduction: cooling 48% and heating 11%. The energy reduction for different types and amounts of PCM can greatly vary for an energy positive house based on variable scenarios (occupancy, ventilation rate, internal gains and temperatures set-points).",Bejan A.; Catalina T.,Conference Proceeding,Energy Procedia,2016-01-01,Universitatea Tehnica de Constructii Bucuresti,active house ;  EFdeN ;  energy efficiency ;  PCM ;  Phase changing materials ;  sustainability

"Neonatal transport incubator: Vibration identification, ranking, and attenuation-a novel approach to patient tray stabilization","The Texas Children's Hospital (TCH) Biomedical Engineering Department, in conjunction with the Kangaroo Crew and Nursing departments, strive to increase the quality of patient care through research and innovation. The TCH has been engaged in a comprehensive research campaign to characterize the type of mechanical forces that the neonate would experience in a transport incubator on a typical neonatal transport. After several years of measuring vibration forces during in-hospital (JClinEng. 2008:74-77), ambulance, and air transportation modalities, it was determined that our core need was to conduct forced vibration tests of the transport incubator in a simulated environment using a large shaker table (Space Act Agreement no. SAA-EA-09-006 with TCH Biomedical Engineering, TCH contract no. NAS-04539, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, DC). Also, to identify the natural frequencies, mode shapes, and damping ratios of the neonatal incubator system, experimental modal analysis (EMA) and operating deflection shape analysis were performed. In 2009, TCH was awarded a Space Act Agreement with National Aeronautics and Space Administration Johnson Space Center to analyze the transport incubator at Johnson Space Center's Vibration and Acoustic Test Facility (Houston, Texas). Over the next 2 years (during nonpeak operational times), random and sine sweep excitation tests, EMA, and operating deflection shape analysis tests were performed to aid in the understanding of the dynamics of the TCH incubator and its modal properties (Space Act Agreement no. SAA-EA-09-006with TCH Biomedical Engineering, TCH contract no. NAS-04539, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, DC). Sine-sweep and EMA test results point to dominant patient tray natural frequencies of 8 to 10 Hz and a vibration magnification factor of 1.60 and 3.75 at patient tray and at neonatal mannequin, respectively. The EMA results showed the tray firstmode (drummode)with maximum deflection at the tray center. Our goal was to look at ways to stabilize the patient tray and measure vibration attenuation using a common inexpensive measurement device (iPhone 5). The model 20H International Biomedical transport incubator was fitted with an accelerometer at patient tray center and the incubator was pushed over several floor transitions during 4 trials for modified and unmodified incubator. When the patient tray was tethered to a rigid frame, vibration attenuation for Z-min, Z-max, and Z-rms was 78%, 193%, and 65%, respectively.",Sallee W.; Bentley A.; Walding D.; Christofi C.,Journal,Journal of Clinical Engineering,2016-01-01,Texas Children's Hospital;NASA Johnson Space Center;Texas Children's Hospital,

Cloud computing as an alternative solution for South African public sector: A case for department of social development,"The South African (SA) government adopted Open Source Software (OSS) with the aim to reduce ICT services cost, less dependencies on outsourced proprietary technology, skills and flexibility. However, the SA government was less successful in achieving this aim due to OSS implementation challenges such as support, funding, training, awareness and human factors. In the midst of the OSS challenges, a potential alternative to address the same objectives aimed by OSS is Cloud Computing adoption. Cloud Computing is the latest phenomena that promises better potentials especially ICT cost reduction, effectiveness and efficiency of IT services. The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility of Cloud Computing adoption in SA government as cost effective approach for ICT services. To achieve this purpose, the study applied mixed research methods, selected a single case study. A triangulation of data collection methods was used to promote validity and reliability of study findings, where primary data was collected using questionnaires, interviews, and document review.

"Integration between industry and university: Case study, Faculty of Engineering at Rabigh, Saudi Arabia","Collaboration between university and industry has long existed, but the rapid increase of global knowledge has increased the demand for strategic relationships that go beyond the conventional funding of research projects. University research should be developed in future to play an important role in industry and in turn economic growth. For a successful collaboration, both sides should overcome the communication and cultural divide that impair university-industry relationships across all categories and undercut their potential. Faculty of Engineering at Rabigh (FER) - King Abdulaziz University (KAU) is strategically located near major industries and facilities such as Petro Rabigh, desalination plant, steel fabrication, and cement industries, which makes FER a nucleus to solve technological problems for all these industries. Much effort has been made at FER to collaborate with these industries through mutual reciprocal visits of university and industry personnel as well as student internships. These are aimed to solve both short- and long-term technological issues at the industrial units. This will not only improve the local knowledge base and skills, but also bring confidence and trust between the two partners. It is well known that innovation does not take place in vacuum: a context - the economy, society, and policy - determines how easy or difficult it is to innovate. In this context, the role of government is also very important to create legislations that make the university-industry relationship a win-win situation.",Alshehri A.; Gutub S.; Ebrahim M.; Shafeek H.; Soliman M.; Abdel-Aziz M.,Journal,Education for Chemical Engineers,2016-01-01,Faculty of Engineering;Faculty of Engineering;Suez University;Faculty of Engineering;King Abdulaziz University,Applied research ;  Bridging model ;  Industrial needs ;  Integration ;  Technological issues ;  University-industry

From ideas to construction innovations: Firms and universities collaborating,"The purpose here is to study patterns of project collaboration found in one government supported programme for construction innovation. Preferred types of interaction were identified using data from two questionnaire surveys, one with experienced construction sector respondents and one aimed at construction researchers. All sixteen development projects within the Swedish Bygginnovationen programme were investigated, relying on documents and a survey of project managers. Important types of interaction, according to construction respondents, are informal contacts, joint research projects and staff mobility. For university respondents, informal contacts is also seen as the most important type of interaction, followed by MSc thesis work in firms and industrial PhD candidates. Grant applicants from manufacturing depended more on university laboratories and were less sensitive to firm/university distance. Laboratory use was also more frequent for projects relying on the field of materials engineering. In conclusion, there is a consensus about which types of collaboration are valuable. The broadness of participation in the programme, ranging over many industries, both as to origin of ideas and ultimate applications, reaches beyond narrow interpretations of the construction industry. Policy makers should recognize the innovation importance of university laboratory facilities and field testing, rather than seeing researchers as sources of ideas.",Bröchner J.; Lagerqvist O.,Journal,Construction Economics and Building,2016-01-01,Luleå University of Technology;Chalmers University of Technology,Collaboration ;  Innovation ;  Sweden ;  The construction industry ;  Universities

Quantitative Model for Supply Chain Visibility: Process Capability Perspective,"Currently, the intensity of enterprise competition has increased as a result of a greater diversity of customer needs as well as the persistence of a long-term recession. The results of competition are becoming severe enough to determine the survival of company. To survive global competition, each firm must focus on achieving innovation excellence and operational excellence as core competency for sustainable competitive advantage. Supply chain management is now regarded as one of the most effective innovation initiatives to achieve operational excellence, and its importance has become ever more apparent. However, few companies effectively manage their supply chains, and the greatest difficulty is in achieving supply chain visibility. Many companies still suffer from a lack of visibility, and in spite of extensive research and the availability of modern technologies, the concepts and quantification methods to increase supply chain visibility are still ambiguous. Based on the extant researches in supply chain visibility, this study proposes an extended visibility concept focusing on a process capability perspective and suggests a more quantitative model using Z score in Six Sigma methodology to evaluate and improve the level of supply chain visibility.",Lee Y.; Rim S.,Journal,Mathematical Problems in Engineering,2016-01-01,Ajou University,
Measuring the effects of goal alignment on innovative engineering design projects,"Manysenior level capstone design courses encourage students to develop innovative solutions to open design projects from industry partners. Student teams that function at a high level are more likely to develop innovative solutions. Prior researchers have proposed that there are four stages to the development of groups: forming, storming, norming, and performing. It has been seen that students often get ""stuck"" in the storming stage and only after they coalesce as a team and set common goals (Norming Phase) can they perform at the highest level to achieve said goals (Performing Phase). The research presented in this paper, focuses on two main areas: (1) understanding what motivates undergraduate engineering students when working on design projects and (2) determining the effects of goal alignment interventions on design teams. A study of senior-level mechanical engineering students was conducted to determine if the effects of setting common goals could be quantified. Five of the total eighteen design teams were selected and guided to set common goals during their design project. Each team was composed of four or five mechanical engineering students. It was found that the teams that received ""interventions"" had an increase in level of performance (p-value = 0.14) and motivation (p-value = 0.19) when compared to teams that were left to their own devices. The main conclusions are summarized as: (1) interventions can be effectively used to explicitly set common goals for the group, (2) interventions have immediate positive effects on the levels of performance and levels of motivation, and (3) a positive correlation between performance and motivation is found.",Mocko G.; Linnerud B.,Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2016-01-01,"Clemson University College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences",Capstone design ;  Goal alignment ;  Innovation
New Challenges for the motivation and learning in engineering education using gamification in MOOC,"The phenomenon ofMOOC(Massive Online Open Courses) is increasingly experienced and is giving rise to new scenarios and challenges with several features that are different from previous approaches to online education. In the field of engineering education, Information and Communication Technologies are making continuous innovation in methods of teaching and learning for students. Engineering Education institutions, like the Technical University of Madrid (Spain), are expanding their online offerings and making a more effective use of technologies for learning. This research presents a gamification cooperativeMOOCmodel (gcMOOC) that can be applied in the design of this type of course. Using an explanatory sequential mixed methods design, which integrates the quantitative and qualitative methods, the study investigates the factors that influence motivation, collaboration and learning in gcMOOC. This work also suggests a set of practical recommendations and tools to improve the motivation, learning level and completion rate of participants in MOOC course in Engineering Educational when the gcMOOC model is implemented. The results of this study state that the incorporation of virtual communities and gamification methodologies increase participant learning motivation in engineering MOOC courses. Additionally, these gamification tools aid students to deepen their learning and involve them in the course increasing their motivation and the completion rates in MOOCs.",Borras-Gene O.; Martiñez-nunez M.; Fidalgo-Blanco Á.,Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2016-01-01,Universidad Politécnica de Madrid,Cooperative learning ;  Game badges ;  Gamification ;  Informal learning ;  Mooc ;  Motivation ;  Social networks
Wider adoption of regenerative medicine driven by open innovation,"OVERVIEW: The large-scale and safe production of cells for medical use is the greatest challenge to the wider adoption of regenerative medicine. Although the culturing of cells for medical use is largely performed manually at present, the key to more widespread use of regenerative medicine lies in the use of techniques for automated cell culture for the up-scaling and rationalization of cell production and the reliable supply of high-quality cells. Hitachi is combining technology from medical engineering to develop closed systems for automated cell culture and cell transportation techniques. The automated cell culture equipment developed by Hitachi can produce cells with quality equivalent to that of manual culture. Hitachi is also working on the development of cell transportation vessels that prevent contamination and maintain constant temperature and pressure. Based on this research and development, Hitachi is seeking to facilitate the wider adoption of regenerative medicine by establishing a cell value chain that can deliver high-quality cells to patients around the world.",Shu K.; Nozaki T.; Suzuki D.; Igarashi Y.; Kiyama M.; Nishimura A.; Kato M.; Takeda S.,Trade Journal,Hitachi Review,2016-01-01,"Hitachi, Ltd.",

Strategic technological innovation for sustainable development,"Technological innovation can be highly instrumental in achieving sustainable development. How well does technology innovation research address the needs of sustainable development and in what directions does this research need to move to usher in sustainable development? We use co-word analysis in existing research publications to map the intellectual structure of the field of 'strategic technological innovation for sustainable development' during the period 1989-2009. The results suggest a list of 26 different research themes. Certain research themes are considered to be central and represent coherent and well-developed concepts. Other themes have arisen, matured, and then faded as major research concepts. Some other themes seem to be emerging or immature, but they signal the appearance of new research areas that are becoming central. Finally, there are some areas that are peripheral and others that need further development.

Improving the global competitiveness of retailers using a cultural analysis of in-store digital innovations,"Global retailers are expanding their business to countries with diverse cultures and consumer preferences. Competitive and sustainable retail chains require advanced e-services linked to in-store digital innovations. This research focuses on cultural dimensions and the implications of implementing global and internet-linked e-service innovations. The research studies how cultural dimensions influence consumers' attitudes toward five types of retail innovations. The cultural dimensions include uncertainty avoidance and collectivistic cultural dimensions to predict acceptance. The research case compares differences between Taiwanese and Swedish university students. A multi-Attribute model shows that Taiwanese prefer innovations with a lower level of self-service. On the other hand, Swedish prefer opposite types of retail innovations. We propose future research to show that these barriers of acceptance can be lowered through the use of advertising, social media, and in-store interaction between customers and staff. The research yields new research directions to help international retailers develop competitive strategies to fit the cultural characteristics of consumers.",Trappey C.; Trappey A.; Mulaomerovic E.,Journal,International Journal of Technology Management,2016-01-01,National Tsing Hua University;National Chiao Tung University,Cultural Dimensions ;  Retail Digital Innovation ;  Retail Service Models. ;  Service Acceptance

Strategies for education for sustainable development - Danish and Australian perspectives,"If engineers are to provide sustainable innovations for future societies, engineers should be able to think and act beyond pure technical competence. This is stressed in political and accreditation frameworks all over the world, and universities are trying to respond to this demand. However, in many cases, sustainability practices seem fragmented and there is a lack of knowledge of strategies and few clear examples of good practice. In this paper, activities to integrate sustainability in two engineering institutions, one in Denmark and one in Australia, are systematically compared to provide an understanding of different kinds of activities and their internal as well as external enablers. A conceptual framework to provide overview of education for sustainability activities and their enablers has been proposed, where activities are related to actors and resources at both university and national levels. The conceptual framework has been developed iteratively - moving back and forth trying to find a suitable structure to capture the contextual pillars of the activities in the two cases, using state-of-art within the research field of education for sustainable development to fill out potential blind spots in the case-material and, finally, continuously shaping the storylines in the two cases to provide the needed overview and understanding of the similarities and differences of the approaches. The interplay between the framework and the case-stories provides a platform for change, as the framework does not only create an overview of activities, it also points out potential routes not taken, and the case studies provide examples of activities, which can be transferred with careful consideration to the internal as well as external context.",Egelund Holgaard J.; Hadgraft R.; Kolmos A.; Guerra A.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2016-01-01,CQUniversity Mackay;Aalborg University,Capabilities ;  Engineering education ;  Problem based learning ;  Sustainability ;  System thinking
An educational and entrepreneurial ecosystem to actualize technology-based social ventures,"The Humanitarian Engineering and Social Entrepreneurship (HESE) Program engages students and faculty across Penn State in the rigorous research, design, field-testing, and launch of technologybased social enterprises that address global development challenges. HESE ventures are embedded in a series of five courses that integrate learning, research, and entrepreneurial engagement. The goal is to educate globally-engaged problem solvers who can create sustainable and scalable value for partnering communities, while simultaneously generating and disseminating new knowledge and lessons learned. This article describes the genesis, foundational philosophies, programmatic learning outcomes, and course mechanics of the HESE Program. The eplum model of student engagement, which embeds HESE sub-projects into regular credit classes and provides rigorous yet non-travelbased experiences to a cross section of students, is discussed. A mixed methods approach is utilized to examine the effectiveness and impact of the eplum curricular model on student learning, specifically in the areas of global awareness, multidisciplinary teamwork, and entrepreneurship education. The entrepreneurial and research outcomes of the program are summarized with a culminating discussion on the emergence of an educational and entrepreneurial ecosystem that has proved pivotal to actualize the ventures and achieve sustainable impact.",Mehta K.; Zappe S.; Brannon M.; Zhao Y.,Journal,Advances in Engineering Education,2016-01-01,Penn State College of Engineering;Pennsylvania State University,Humanitarian engineering ;  International development ;  Service learning ;  Social entrepreneurship ;  Social innovation
The role of entrepreneurship program models and experiential activities on engineering student outcomes,"Entrepreneurship education is being delivered to greater numbers of engineering students througha variety of courses, programs, and experiential learning activities. Some of these opportunities are designed primarily to serve engineering students in their departments and colleges, while others are cross-campus, university-wide efforts to serve students from many disciplines. To date, few researchers have examined to what extent differing program models and experiential activities impact students' perceptions of their entrepreneurial knowledge, skills, and self-efficacy. This paper examines these issues based on the results of a survey of 501 senior level engineering students enrolled in three institutions that offered three different models of entrepreneurship education. Findings indicate that higher perceptions of entrepreneurial knowledge were associated with the number of entrepreneurship courses taken and involvement in experiential learning activities. Further, students who were enrolled at an institution with a multidisciplinary program tended to rate their entrepreneurial abilities higher than those at two institutions with programs more embedded in engineering departments. Thisresearch provides faculty and administrators with valuable insight that can inform the development ofentrepreneurship programs targeting engineers, and suggests areas for future research.",Duval-Couetil N.; Shartrand A.; Reed T.,Journal,Advances in Engineering Education,2016-01-01,College of Engineering;Purdue Polytechnic Institute;VentureWell,Engineering education ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Innovation ;  Pedagogy
From scenarios to “free-player”: Evaluating the users experience of ambient technologies in the home,"The ambient intelligence (AmI) vision of interactive home environments with embedded technologies that learn from our behaviour and provide services in anticipation of our needs has been with us since the 1990s. While the technical knowledge and capability to realise the physical aspects of the vision is now within our grasp, user involvement in developing and refining the concepts underlying this new intimate relationship between humans and their technologies appears so far to have been limited. This may, in part, be due to the very nature of the research and innovation process, in that technical competence is often far ahead of the potential users ability to envisage how such services could be usefully and affordably incorporated in their everyday lives. It is understandable therefore that user involvement in the early stages of development may be seen as hindering innovation. Instead, one approach has been to capture the user perspective in visionary scenarios, often written by the researchers themselves. These are useful for elaborating the vision and driving further technical innovation, however, they often assume an established relationship between system and user and thus avoid more mundane issues such as how the user might practically incorporate AmI technologies in his or her everyday life today or in the near future. If we are to make the transition from future vision to present reality we must at some point move away from the visionary scenario and engage with users in the process of evolving our existing home environments to incorporate practical and grounded AmI solutions. This chapter looks first at the notion of user experience and options for the location of AmI evaluation studies in general. It moves on to describe some of the key features of the Adaptive and Trusted Ambient Ecologies (ATRACO) concept and prototype from the user perspective and proceeds to discuss related research. The second part of the chapter describes a preliminary evaluation of ATRACO followed by a description of the design for the participant oriented final study that draws on Dervin’s Sense-Making approach. The authors conclude that the user experience evaluation has significantly contributed to the development of the ATRACO concepts in a way that ensures they are relevant to everyday users.",Van Helvert J.; Wagner C.,Book,Next Generation Intelligent Environments: Ambient Adaptive Systems: Second Edition,2016-01-01,University of Essex,

Over-constraints and a unified mobility method for general spatial mechanisms Part 2: Application of the principle,"The pre-research on mobility analysis presented a unified-mobility formula and a methodology based on reciprocal screw theory by HUANG, which focused on classical and modern parallel mechanisms. However its range of application needs to further extend to general multi-loop spatial mechanism. This kind of mechanism is not only more complex in structure but also with strong motion coupling among loops, making the mobility analysis even more complicated, and the relevant research has long been ignored. It is focused on how to apply the new principle for general spatial mechanism to those various multi-loop spatial mechanisms, and some new meaningful knowledge is further found. Several typical examples of the general multi-loop spatial mechanisms with motion couple even strong motion couple are considered. These spatial mechanisms include different closing way: over-constraint appearing in rigid closure, in movable closure, and in dynamic closure as well; these examples also include two different new methods to solve this kind of issue: the way to recognize over-constraints by analyzing relative movement between two connected links and by constructing a virtual loop to recognize over-constraints. In addition, over-constraint determination tabulation is brought to analyze the motion couple. The researches above are all based upon the screw theory. All these multi-loop spatial mechanisms with different kinds of structures can completely be solved by following the directions and examples, and the new mobility theory based on the screw theory is also proved to be valid. This study not only enriches and develops the theory and makes the theory more universal, but also has a special meaning for innovation in mechanical engineering.",Lu W.; Zeng D.; Huang Z.,Journal,Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering (English Edition),2016-01-01,Yanshan University,Mobility analysis ;  Motion coupling ;  Multi-loop spatial mechanism ;  Over-constraint ;  Screw theory

TRIZ or DFMA combined with QFD as product design methodology: A review,"Quality Function Deployment (QFD) is a structured methodology that uses customer and technical requirements for designers and manufacturers to provide better products. Many researchers combine or integrate the technique of QFD with other methodologies such as Theory Inventive of Problem Solving (TRIZ) or Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DFMA) to optimise product design innovation and improvement. The combined methodologies are even used to solve process problems. Initial literature review of the application of stand-alone QFD poised several problems. Combining QFD with other techniques, such as TRIZ and DFMA, has helped to address these issues and forms the basis of future research. The integrated methods can solve main contradictory problems more precisely from product demand analysis to product design, production and application. Review work of the literature, specifically that on research and development of QFD, TRIZ and DFMA, showed that the said methodologies have been widely and successfully implemented in several practical applications such as resolving conflicts between customer and technical/engineering requirements and reducing production cost. This review work provides an in-depth analysis of identifying and finding issues of strengths, weaknesses and outcomes of the QFD when combined with TRIZ and also of QFD integrated with DFMA.",Ginting R.; Ali A.,Journal,Pertanika Journal of Science and Technology,2016-01-01,Universitas Sumatera Utara;Universiti Sains Malaysia,DFMA ;  Product design ;  QFD TRIZ
Creativity in design teams: the influence of personality traits and risk attitudes on creative concept selection,"Concept selection is recognized as a crucial component of the design process that largely involves informal group discussions within design teams. However, little is known about what factors affect the selection or filtering of creative ideas during this process. This is problematic because in order for innovation to occur, individuals must first identify and select the creative concepts developed in the early stages of design. However, prior research has shown that individuals tend to select conventional alternatives during this process due to the inherent risk associated with creative concepts. Therefore, the current study was developed to understand how personality traits, risk attitudes, and idea generation abilities impact the promotion or filtering of creative ideas in a team setting. The results from our empirical study with engineering students reveal that teams who have higher levels of conscientiousness, agreeableness, and tolerance for ambiguity are more prone to select novel concepts. In addition, the results revealed that the teams who generate creative ideas did not necessarily select creative ideas during concept selection. These results add to our understanding of team-based decision making during concept selection and allow us to provide guidelines for increasing the flow of creative ideas through this process.",Toh C.; Miller S.,Journal,Research in Engineering Design,2016-01-01,Penn State College of Engineering,Concept selection ;  Creativity ;  Decision making ;  Design teams ;  Personality ;  Risk attitudes
"Value-sensitive design for indigenous people of Oaxaca, Mexico","This paper describes an ongoing research and development project on engineering value-sensitive design for indigenous people called Mixtecs, and for wider segments of the system of focus, in Oaxaca, Mexico. Although the Mixtec people have creatively maintained their fundamental way of doing things from the pre-Hispanic past to the present day, they are being influenced by a new wave of conflicting factors. These factors, namely economical, technological, environmental and global issues, threaten the survival of the Mixtecs' approach. In addition to these issues, the fast growing rate of crime also impedes growth. A crucial way to understand the current Mixtecan situation is to use complex systems thinking to address the core issues that inhibit growth and subsequently to implement action. It is believed here that there are essential issues of value and these have implications for engineering design. Engineering value-sensitive design may have important implications in addressing the Mixtec people's situation without compromising their values, culture and traditions.",Santos-Reyes D.; Mendoza-Jasso A.,Journal,International Journal of Design and Nature and Ecodynamics,2016-01-01,Mixteca University of Technology (UTM;I'chi Research and Engineering,Crime ;  Design ;  Innovation ;  Sustainability ;  Value
Making the leap: The translation of innovative surgical devices from the laboratory to the operating room,"Objective: To determine the rate and extent of translation of innovative surgical devices from the laboratory to first-in-human studies, and to evaluate the factors influencing such translation. Summary Background Data: Innovative surgical devices have preceded many of the major advances in surgical practice. However, the process by which devices arising from academia find their way to translation remains poorly understood. Methods: All biomedical engineering journals, and the 5 basic science journals with the highest impact factor, were searched between January 1993 and January 2000 using the Boolean search term ""surgery OR surgeon OR surgical"". Articles were included if they described the development of a new device and a surgical application was described. A recursive search of all citations to the article was performed using the Web of Science (Thompson-Reuters, New York, NY) to identify any associated first-in-human studies published by January 2015. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed for the time to first-in-human studies. Factors influencing translation were evaluated using log-rank and Cox proportional hazards models. Results: A total of 8297 articles were screened, and 205 publications describing unique devices were identified. The probability of a first-in-human at 10 years was 9.8%. Clinical involvement was a significant predictor of a first-in-human study (P = 0.02); devices developed with early clinical collaboration were over 6 times more likely to be translated than those without [RR 6.5 (95% confidence interval 0.9-48)]. Conclusions: These findings support initiatives to increase clinical translation through improved interactions between basic, translational, and clinical researchers.",Marcus H.; Payne C.; Hughes-Hallett A.; Gras G.; Leibrandt K.; Nandi D.; Yang G.,Journal,Annals of Surgery,2016-01-01,Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust;Imperial College London,Diffusion of innovations ;  Innovation ;  Surgery ;  Technology
The complementarity of openness: How MakerBot leveraged Thingiverse in 3D printing,"Selective openness allows a firm to sell a systemic innovation that combines both open and proprietary technologies. Such firm strategies are now common for open source software and other information goods. However, they pose conceptual and practical uncertainties for hardware-focused companies, particularly as research on open hardware has emphasized community rather than firm success. Here we study firm openness in 3D printing, with a case study of how MakerBot Industries leveraged external communities and selective openness become the consumer market leader. After reviewing the literature on systemic innovation and selective openness, we document the proprietary strategies of a dozen startup companies during the first two decades of the 3D printing industry. We contrast this to the open hardware, software and content strategy that MakerBot's founders used to enter and grow the consumer market from 2009 onward. We show how MakerBot shifted to a selectively open, systemic innovation strategy that complemented proprietary hardware and software with open user-generated content from its Thingiverse online community. From this, we suggest the inherent complementarity of selective openness strategies between open and proprietary components, and conclude with predictions as to when and how a startup or incumbent firm will combine open and proprietary elements.",West J.; Kuk G.,Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2016-01-01,Nottingham Business School;Keck Graduate Institute,3D printing ;  Complementary assets ;  Online communities ;  Open design ;  Open innovation
Novel treatments in development for melanoma,"The past several years can be considered a renaissance era in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Following a 30-year stretch in which oncologists barely put a dent in a very grim overall survival (OS) rate for these patients, things have rapidly changed course with the recent approval of three new melanoma drugs by the FDA. Both oncogene-targeted therapy and immune checkpoint blockade approaches have shown remarkable efficacy in a subset of melanoma patients and have clearly been game-changers in terms of clinical impact. However, most patients still succumb to their disease, and thus, there remains an urgent need to improve upon current therapies. Fortunately, innovations in molecular medicine have led to many silent gains that have greatly increased our understanding of the nature of cancer biology as well as the complex interactions between tumors and the immune system. They have also allowed for the first time a detailed understanding of an individual patient’s cancer at the genomic and proteomic level. This information is now starting to be employed at all stages of cancer treatment, including diagnosis, choice of drug therapy, treatment monitoring, and analysis of resistance mechanisms upon recurrence. This new era of personalized medicine will foreseeably lead to paradigm shifts in immunotherapeutic treatment approaches such as individualized cancer vaccines and adoptive transfer of genetically modified T cells. Advances in xenograft technology will also allow for the testing of drug combinations using in vivo models, a truly necessary development as the number of new drugs needing to be tested is predicted to skyrocket in the coming years. This chapter will provide an overview of recent technological developments in cancer research, and how they are expected to impact future diagnosis, monitoring, and development of novel treatments for metastatic melanoma.",Bernatchez C.; Cooper Z.; Wargo J.; Hwu P.; Lizée G.,Book Series,Cancer Treatment and Research,2016-01-01,The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center,Immunotherapy ;  Personalized medicine ;  Targeted therapy
Wicked problems in space technology development at NASA,"Technological innovation is key to enable future space exploration missions at NASA. Technology development, however, is not only driven by performance and resource considerations, but also by a broad range of directly or loosely interconnected factors. These include, among others, strategy, policy and politics at various levels, tactics and programmatics, interactions between stakeholders, resource requirements, performance goals from component to system level, mission infusion targets, portfolio execution and tracking, and technology push or mission pull. Furthermore, at NASA, these influences occur on varying timescales and at diverse geographic locations. Such a complex and interconnected system could impede space technology innovation in this examined segment of the government environment. Hence, understanding the process through NASAs Planning, Programming, Budget and Execution cycle could benefit strategic thinking, planning and execution. Insights could be gained through suitable models, for example assessing the key drivers against the framework of Wicked Problems. This paper discusses NASA specific space technology innovation and innovation barriers in the government environment through the characteristics of Wicked Problems; that is, they do not have right or wrong solutions, only improved outcomes that can be reached through authoritative, competitive, or collaborative means. We will also augment the Wicked Problems model to account for the temporally and spatially coupled, and cyclical nature of this NASA specific case, and propose how appropriate models could improve understanding of the key influencing factors. In turn, such understanding may subsequently lead to reducing innovation barriers, and stimulating technology innovation at NASA. Furthermore, our approach can be adopted for other government-directed environments to gain insights into their structures, hierarchies, operational flow, and interconnections to facilitate circular dialogs towards preferred outcomes.",Balint T.; Stevens J.,Journal,Acta Astronautica,2016-01-01,Royal College of Art,Budget process ;  Innovation ;  Strategy ;  Technology portfolio ;  Wicked problems

Ergonomic approach for pillow concept design,"Sleep quality is an essential factor to human beings for health. The current paper conducted four studies to provide a suitable pillow for promoting sleep quality.Study 1 investigated the natural positions of 40 subjects during sleep to derive key-points for a pillow design. The results suggested that the supine and lateral positions were alternatively 24 times a night, and the current pillows were too high for the supine position and too low for lateral positions.Study 2 measured body dimensions related to pillow design of 40 subjects to determine pillow sizes. The results suggested that the pillow height were quite different in supine position and lateral position and needed to take into consideration for a pillow design.Study 3 created a pillow design based on the results of above studies. The pillow was a U-form in the front of view in which the pillow height in the middle area was lower for the supine position, and both sides were higher for the lateral positions.Study 4 assessed sleep quality of 6 subjects by using the proposed pillows and the current pillows. The results showed that the newly designed pillow led to significantly higher sleep quality, and the new design received an innovation patent.",Cai D.; Chen H.,Journal,Applied Ergonomics,2016-01-01,National Yunlin University of Science and Technology,Ergonomic design ;  Pillow design ;  Sleep duration ;  Sleep position ;  Sleep quality
